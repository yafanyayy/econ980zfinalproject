And welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. 
My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the investors section of our website. 
Further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Now turning to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we consistently applied for decades, along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project, execution and effective cost management. 
While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses. 
ExxonMobil completed 6 major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, United States and West Africa, added 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth. 
Strong operating performance of today's portfolio, along with these project conditions, delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans. 
The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion, with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the U.S., estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate significant blow volatility in the financial sector. And Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness. Whereas, Europe's economy remains stable, with continued temperate growth. 
Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. 
Furthermore, global refining in Chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations. 
Turning now to the financial results shown on Slide 5. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. Corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.  Of that total, $500 million were used to purchase shares. 
CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter 2014 as a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. 
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion, and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $37.8 billion. 
The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. Total for the quarter, cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. 
The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. 
Uses included not investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short term borrowing by about $4 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segment of results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. 
In the sequential comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. 
On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter, sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. 
Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel and gas was down $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
Favorable volume and mix affects increased earnings by $100 million. Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in The Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts, including U.S. preferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration for appropriate assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14% were ramp up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by fuel decline. 
Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory reduction restrictions in The Netherlands and fuel decline, partly offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter and natural gas prices were down $0.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix affects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth, along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. 
Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects and new project start-ups. 
Moving now to the Downstream financial operating results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million, respectively. All other items increased earnings $170 million primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects, partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower U.S. maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales, partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects. 
Moving now to the Chemical financial operating results starting on Slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million, while favorable volumes mix added $80 million. 
Other items decreased earnings $160 million primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities. 
Turning now to the full year financial results, starting on Slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. Corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to reduce shares outstanding, and of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares. 
CapEx total about $31 billion for the year, the reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015.  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion. 
Turning to Slide 18. Cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. 
Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year. 
Moving to Slide 19. Graphic illustrates the corporation sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion from its shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justified the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity. 
The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows, along with our financial strength, provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand. 
Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. 
Total dividends per share is $2.88 are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. 
In the first quarter of 2016, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. 
During 2015, ExxonMobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. 
Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015. 
So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost-savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on our investment plans market our upcoming Analyst Meeting. 
Moving now to Slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs. 
Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results, starting on Slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
Favorable volume mix effects increased earnings $810 million for contributions to major project start-ups for the last couple of years as well as our work program activities, partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in The Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses. 
Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by asset hydrating, including the start-up of new development projects. 
Moving to Slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the the year at 4.1 million oil-equivalent per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlements impacts, which were partly offset by fuel decline. 
Natural gas production, however, was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in The Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the U.S., along with higher entitlements. 
Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on Slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by increased maintenance reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. 
On Slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains. 
Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. 6 major projects start-ups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progress development of our high-quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015. 
In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip Central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance. 
Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next 2 years. We expect to start up 6 of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity. 
Moving on to Slide 26. We continue to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to ExxonMobil's asset portfolio, while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. 
In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history, is nearly complete, and we will begin appraising the lease of discovery during the first quarter. 
We also acquired a 35% interest in operatorship for Canje Block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, netting over 520,000 net acres. 
In the Romanian Black Sea, ExxonMobil has completed exploration activities in Neptune Block after successfully drilling 7 consecutive wells since July 2014. 
Based on the results of the program, including a successful wall protest of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies. 
And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuquén province. Program consists of 5 wells along construction and production facilities and a gas pipeline. 
Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. ExxonMobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres. 
In Canada, we awarded interest in 3 blocks offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in prudent oil hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build in our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. 
And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest and are currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres. 
So now I'd like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance, which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. ExxonMobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value through the cycle as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results. 
Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, drawing the contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce cost. 
In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. 
Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion. Our commitment to shareholders remains strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. 
Now we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with a live webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

It includes consolidated and equity companies, and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015. To answer your first question, I first like to say that, as I said, in my prepared comments, we were down in the year in 2015, both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings and soft business climate. There was reduced activity, and then importantly, timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects our prudent cash management and our continued investment through this cycle in  attractive, high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value.

As I said, the seismic acquisition is nearing completion, the results from both the well as well as the seismic are being actively assessed to assess the full block potential as well as commercial viability of the lase of discovery. Obviously, the objective of the first well is appraisal well and it's intended to give us important information to size the resource as well as get a test on it to assess the key variables associated with the commercial viability.

LNG is anticipated to triple between now and 2040, so we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term. I would tell you that PNG is a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did an exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is get more out of the asset, and we were able to get it up to in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result, and we're still going.

So the organization is very focused on really managing the fundamentals. As I indicated were -- for both gas and oil, we're construct on a long-term demand growth. And it's fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we put in place. And if you look near term, demand has been growing about 1 million-barrel per day per year and although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have, I mean, the first half of this year, we have about 1.5 million barrels per day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as season demand increases. We got to come in balance, but we have seen historically, we do have a bit of a build up in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG is, as I said previously that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040."

And as I said, we'll talk more about our investment plans and our thoughts on volumes next month in the Analyst Meeting. But a couple things to share with you. Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to 2014 was primarily a result of a drop off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously, in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build in to our spend pattern. As we go forward, I would tell you, right now, most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we've slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward. But short of that, I really don't have any more specifics to share as to breaking the CapEx spend down further. We'll continue to live within our means as we've shown historically. And if we need, we'll have to tighten up if we had to further."

So the decision to cut the buyback doesn't at all reflect the quality inventory. Quite the contrary. I mean, the inventory is very robust. Decision on the buyback, as we've said before, our capital allocation approach is really focused on the dual priority of finding attractive investments and continuing to provide a reliable and growing dividend. And the share buybacks has always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. As we continue to progress in a very challenging business climate, you saw us prudently taper back the buyback program.

Once again, it's a conscious decision to be measured in our investment program. When we saw the big ramp up in rigs back in 2014, 2015, we're very measured and how we ramp up because we wanted to ensure that we fully develop the learning curve and capture those real cost benefits that translate into higher value as we fully develop these fields. So the investments that we're making right now are economic, they are attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got, one of the few that can continue to invest in the down cycle. We've high graded our -- all the services that we get in our own conventional business. In fact, I'd extend that globally, and we are continuing on those learning curves.

Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth is coming to extensive returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other super majors, too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation especially when considering that the valuation for some of the bigger oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level the past 2 decades and in some cases, 3 decades. So my question is whether or not the issue instructed returns and growth are being revisited internally maybe more so than in the past? Or is that what is implied and a new spending outlook that's talked about today? And then also, whether or not returns on capital, which I didn't see mentioned in the presentation is still as relevant as it used to be. So 2 questions."

And I would tell you that is our view has never changed on the importance of making about the right value choices. We saw back in the -- I'd say, in the early 2000s to the mid-2010 time frame, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we can make a investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture that ultimately was going to improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of nonproductive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came on stream that they were going to be accretive to our overall average financial performance. So unfortunately, as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless, we still feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus is been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately, we believe that these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so had an impact in our return on capital employed are going to be accretive to our financial performance over the long term, and we're able to make the right decision. Now to your second question, on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us. We believe it is a fundamental measure that differentiates us, and that's why we continue to talk about it. We have never lost sight of the importance of that metric relative to the investment decisions that we're making."

First, let me just make sure you're going to understand the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billion of it -- $1 billion of that is operating expenses. It then includes a number of things, positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture. Remember I talked in the past about having a unique organization or global terminal organization, that's really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle costs. The number includes benefits in energy costs, includes benefits from our asset management program as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously, we can talk about all these new projects coming on stream with incomes and increase in the operating costs and we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year. So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year-on-year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx. It includes a lot of same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that, that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our claim guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year-on-year reduction of CapEx was $7.5 billion, so we didn't really include the $4.5 billion and the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year-on-year, our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion."

Another one been how do we get the structural capital efficiency built in so that the economics are more robust. I'll highlight a couple of things. One in 2015, you'll recall in West Africa, we brought in, brought on 2 very capital efficient subsea tiebacks to insisting infrastructure. One being the Kizomba's satellite Phase 2 and being the other one [indiscernible] Phase 2 that allows us to leverage existing oil rich and develop the deepwater resources in a much more cost effective way. Clearly, there is a lot of opportunity to continue to standardize the subsea kit, but the organization is looking at all the levers to improve the economics of deepwater. In the Gulf of Mexico, I should note that Hadrian South was another example of efficient capital efficiency subsea tied back into existing infrastructure."

My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go f",2774,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. 
My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Now turning to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we've consistently applied for decades, along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project, execution and effective cost management. 
While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses. 
ExxonMobil completed 6 major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, the United States and West Africa added 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth. The strong operating performance of the base portfolio, along with these project conditions, delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans. 
The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the U.S., estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate with significant volatility in the financial sector and Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness, whereas Europe's economy remained stable with continued tepid growth.  Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions, and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. Furthermore, global refining and chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations. 
Turning now to the financial results on -- shown on Slide 5. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. The corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.  Of that total, $500 million was used to purchase shares.  CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter 2014 as a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion, and debt was $38.7 billion. 
The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. Uses included net investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short term borrowing by about $4 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segment of results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year-ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. 
In the sequential comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from a year-ago quarter. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel, and gas was down $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.  Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts, including U.S. preferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year-ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14% were ramp-up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory reduction restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, partly offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million, where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter. And natural gas prices were down $0.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth, along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects and new project start-ups. 
Moving now to the Downstream financial operating results starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes/mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million, respectively. All other items increased earnings, $170 million, primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects, partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower U.S. maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales, partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects. 
Moving now to the Chemical financial operating results starting on Slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million, while favorable volumes/mix added $80 million. Other items decreased earnings $160 million primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities. 
Turning now to the full year financial results starting on Slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. The corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx totaled about $31 billion for the year, a reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015.  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion. 
Turning to Slide 18. Cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year. 
Moving to Slide 19. Graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion funded shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justified the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity.  The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows, along with our financial strength, provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand. 
Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. 
Total dividends per share of $2.88 are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. In the first quarter of 2016, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. During 2015, ExxonMobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015. 
So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on investment plans at our upcoming Analyst Meeting.
Moving now to Slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs. 
Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on Slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume/mix effects increased earnings $810 million were contributions, major project start-ups over the last couple of years as well as our work program activities were partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses. Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by asset high-grading, including the start-up of new development projects. 
Moving to Slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlements impacts, which were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production, however, was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the U.S., along with higher entitlements. 
Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on Slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by increased maintenance, reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. 
On Slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes/mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains. 
Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher-value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. 6 major project start-ups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progressed development of our high-quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015. In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance. 
Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next 2 years. We expect to start up 6 of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity. 
Moving now to Slide 26. We continue to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to ExxonMobil's asset portfolio while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history, is nearly complete, and we will begin appraising the lease of discovery during the first quarter. We also acquired a 35% interest and operatorship for the Canje Block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, adding over 520,000 net acres. 
In the Romanian Black Sea, ExxonMobil has completed exploration activities in the Neptun Block after successfully drilling 7 consecutive wells since July 2014. Based on the results of the program, including a successful well test of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies. 
And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuquén province. The program consists of 5 wells, along with construction and production facilities and a gas pipeline. 
Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. ExxonMobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 in offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres. 
In Canada, we're awarded interest in 3 blocks, offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in a proven oil-equivalent hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build on our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. 
And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest and are currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres. 
So I'd now like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. ExxonMobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value through the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results.  Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Buying the contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce cost. In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion. 
Our commitment to shareholders remains strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. 
Now we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with a live webcast beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

The CapEx guidance that we've provided for 2016 of $23.2 billion is all in. It includes consolidated and equity companies, and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015. To answer your first question, I first like to say that, as I said in my prepared comments, we were down in the year -- in 2015, both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings in a soft business climate. There was reduced activity, and then importantly, timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects our prudent cash management and our continued investment through the cycle in attractive, high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value. The short of it is that we're going to continue to live within our means. We're going to maintain the financial flexibility. And we've got -- as you heard us talk in the past, we've got a very diverse, high-quality inventory investment opportunities that we'll continue to progress."

As I said, the seismic acquisition is nearing completion. The results from both the well as well as the seismic are being actively assessed to assess the full block potential as well as the commercial viability of the lease of discovery. Obviously, the objective of the first well is an appraisal well and lease it, and it's intended to give us important information to size the resource as well as get a test on it to assess the key variables associated with the commercial viability. So I would tell you that there are early studies underway on potential development options for the field, but I don't have anything more to share on that."

So we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term. I will tell you that for -- which is PNG is a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did an exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is get more out of the asset, and we were able to get it up to -- in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result, and we're still going.

And it's the fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we've put in place. And if you look near term, demand has been growing about 1 million barrels per day per year. And although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have -- I mean, the first half of this year, we have about 1.5 million barrels a day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as seasonal demand increases. We got to come in balance, but we have seen historically, we do have a bit of a buildup in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG is, as I said previously, that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040."

Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to the 2014 was primarily a result of a drop-off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously, in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build in to our spend pattern. As we go forward, I would tell you right now, most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It does -- it's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we have slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward.

Once again, it's a conscious decision to be measured in our investment program. When we saw the big ramp up in rigs back in 2014, 2015, we're very measured in how we ramped up, because we wanted to ensure that we fully developed the learning curve and capture those real cost benefits that translate into higher value as we fully develop these fields. So the investments that we're making right now are economic, they're attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got, one of the few that can continue to invest in the down cycle. We've high graded our -- all the services that we get in our unconventional business. In fact, I'd extend that globally, and we are continuing on those learning curves. And I think it just better positions us to maximize the value from these assets."

Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth is coming to extensive returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other super majors too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation, especially when considering that the valuation for some of the big oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level the past 2 decades and in some cases, 3 decades. So my question is whether or not the issues of structured returns and growth are being revisited internally maybe more so than in the past? Or is that what is implied in the new spending outlook that you talked about today? And then also, whether or not returns on capital, which I didn't see mentioned in the presentation, is still as relevant as it used to be. So 2 questions."

And I would tell you that is never -- our view has never changed on the importance of making the right value choices. We saw back in the -- I'd say, in the early 2000s to the mid-2010 time frame, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we can make an investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture, that ultimately was going to improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of nonproductive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came on stream, that they were going to be accretive to our overall average financial performance. So unfortunately, as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless, we still very -- feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus has been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately, we believe that the, these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so had an impact on our return on capital employed, are going to be accretive to our financial performance over the long term, and we did the right decision. Now to your second question, on return on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us. We believe it is a fundamental measure that differentiates us, and that's why we continue to talk about it. We have never lost sight of the importance of that metric relative to the investment decisions that we're making."

First, let me just make sure everybody understands the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting, so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billions of it -- billion of that is operating expenses. It then includes a number of things, positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture. Remember I talked in the past about having a unique organization or global terminal organization, that is really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle cost. The number includes benefits in energy costs, it includes benefits from our asset management program, as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously, we can talk about all these new projects coming on stream with incomes and increase in the operating cost, and we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year. So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year-on-year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx. It includes a lot of same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that, that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our claim guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year-on-year reduction of CapEx was $7.5 billion, so we didn't really include the $4.5 billion in the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year-on-year, our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion."

And clearly, I mean it's topical for many in the energy sector. I think first and foremost, let me just be clear. I mean, we get value from the AAA credit rating in our business, whether it be access to financial markets or access to resources. I mean there is a benefit that we get from it, and we see it as being important. But it is really an outcome of our long-standing, effective management of the business, including things like our strong balance sheet, the way we have prudently managed our cash, our disciplined investment and our leading financial and operating results, all of which has allowed us the financial flexibility to invest in the cycle as we've been discussing. I tell you that the current environment is clearly tough, but we have managed the business to be durable on the low end of commodity prices. We're very well positioned to continue the same level of secured performance in the future, and we think that all underpins the strong credit rating that we have."

One, in terms of the quality of the resources, and the certainty on overall potential from those resources. Another one being, how do we get the structural capital efficiency built in, so that the economics are more robust. I'll highlight a couple of things. One, in 2015, you'll recall in West Africa, we brought in, brought on 2 very capital-efficient subsea tiebacks to insisting infrastructure. One being Kizomb Satellites Phase 2 and another one being Erha North Phase 2, that allows us to leverage existing knowledge, and develop the deepwater resources in a much more cost effective way. Clearly, there is a lot of opportunity to continue to standardize the subsea kit, but the organization is looking at all the levers to improve the economics of deepwater. In the Gulf of Mexico, I should note that Hadrian South was another example of an efficient -- capital efficient subsea tieback into the existing infrastructure."

In doing so, I'd also say we're unrelenting in, on our focus at capturing efficiencies to make sure that we rightsize the organization. Again, given the likelihood of business volatility. I'd also highlight, John, that another benefit of our integrated business model is that we're able to be agile in redeploying personnel to segments of our business that are experiencing market strength or growth such as our Downstream and Chemical businesses right now. All that said, our employee headcount has been coming down consistently since the Exxon and Mobil merger. We're down about 35% during 2015.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Now turning to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we've consistently applied for decades, along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project execution and effective cost management.  While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses. 
ExxonMobil completed 6 major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, the United States and West Africa added 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth. Strong operating performance of the base portfolio, along with these project conditions, delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans.  The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the U.S., estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate with significant volatility in the financial sector and Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness, whereas Europe's economy remained stable with continued tepid growth.  Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions, and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. Furthermore, global refining and chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations. 
Turning now to the financial results on -- shown on Slide 5. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. The corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.  Of that total, $500 million was used to purchase shares.  CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion, and debt was $38.7 billion. 
The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. Uses included net investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short-term borrowing by about $4 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year-ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. 
In the sequential comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from year-ago quarter. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel, and gas was down $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.  Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts, including U.S. deferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year-ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14% where ramp-up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, partly offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million, where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter. And natural gas prices were down $0.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth, along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects and new project start-ups. 
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes/mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million, respectively. All other items increased earnings $170 million, primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects, partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower U.S. maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales, partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects. 
Moving now to the Chemical financial operating results starting on Slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million, while favorable volumes/mix added $80 million. Other items decreased earnings $160 million primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities. 
Turning now to the full year financial results starting on Slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. The corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx totaled about $31 billion for the year, a reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015.  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion. 
Turning to Slide 18. Cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year. 
Moving to Slide 19. Graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion funded shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justified the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity.  The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows, along with our financial strength, provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand. 
Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Total dividends per share of $2.88 are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. In the first quarter of 2016, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. During 2015, ExxonMobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015. 
So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on investment plans at our upcoming Analyst Meeting.
Moving now to Slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs. 
Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on Slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume/mix effects increased earnings $810 million were contributions, major project start-ups over the last couple of years as well as our work program activities were partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses. Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by asset high-grading, including the start-up of new development projects. 
Moving to Slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlements impacts, which were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production, however, was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the U.S., along with higher entitlements. 
Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on Slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by increased maintenance, reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. 
On Slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes/mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains. 
Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher-value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. Six major project start-ups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progressed development of our high-quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015. In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance.  Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next 2 years. We expect to start up 6 of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity. 
Moving now to Slide 26. We continue to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to ExxonMobil's asset portfolio while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history is nearly complete, and we will begin appraising the lease of discovery during the first quarter. We also acquired a 35% interest and operatorship for the Canje Block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, adding over 520,000 net acres. 
In the Romanian Black Sea, ExxonMobil has completed exploration activities in the Neptun Block after successfully drilling 7 consecutive wells since July 2014. Based on the results of the program, including a successful well test of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies.  And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuquén province. The program consists of 5 wells, along with construction and production facilities and a gas pipeline.  Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. ExxonMobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 in offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres. 
In Canada, we're awarded interest in 3 blocks, offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in a proven oil-equivalent hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build on our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron.  And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest and are currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres. 
So would now like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. ExxonMobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value through the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results.  Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Buying the contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce cost. In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion. 
Our commitment to shareholders remains strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. Now we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with a live webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

The CapEx guidance that we've provided for 2016 of $23.2 billion is all in. It includes consolidated and equity companies, and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015. To answer your first question, I'd first like to say that, as I said in my prepared comments, we were down in the year in 2015, both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings in a soft business climate. There was reduced activity, and then importantly, timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects our prudent cash management and our continued investment through the cycle in attractive, high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value. The short of it is that we're going to continue to live within our means. We're going to maintain the financial flexibility. And we've got -- as you heard us talk in the past, we've got a very diverse, high-quality inventory investment opportunities that we'll continue to progress."

So we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term. I will tell you that for , let's use PNG as a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did an exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is get more out of the asset, and we were able to get it up to in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result, and we're still going.

So the organization is very focused on really managing the fundamentals. As I indicated we're -- for both gas and oil, we're constructive on long-term demand growth. And it's the fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we've put in place. And if you look near term, demand has been growing about 1 million barrels per day per year. And although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have -- I mean, the first half of this year, we have about 1.5 million barrels a day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as seasonal demand increases. We got to come in balance, but we have seen historically, we do have a bit of a buildup in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG is, as I said previously, that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040."

Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to the 2014 was primarily a result of a drop-off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously, in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build in to our spend pattern. As we go forward, I would tell you right now, most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It does -- it's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we have slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward.

So the investments that we're making right now are economic, they're attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got. We're one of the few that can continue to invest in the down cycle. We've high graded our -- all the services that we get in our unconventional business.

Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth has come at the expense of returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other super majors too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation, especially when considering that the valuation for some of the big oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level the past 2 decades and in some cases, 3 decades. So my question is whether or not the issues of structured returns and growth are being revisited internally maybe more so than in the past? Or is that what is implied in the new spending outlook that you talked about today?

Well, Doug, on the first one, I mean your point about value creation in our investment program, we couldn't agree with you more. And I would tell you that it is never -- our view has never changed on the importance of making the right value choices. We saw back in the -- I'd say, in the early 2000s to the mid-2010 time frame, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we can make an investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture, that ultimately was going to improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of nonproductive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came on stream, that they were going to be accretive to our overall average financial performance. So unfortunately, as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless, we still very -- feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus has been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately, we believe that the, these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so had an impact on our return on capital employed, are going to be accretive to our financial performance over the long term, and believe they were the right decision. Now to your second question, on return on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us.

First, let me just make sure everybody understands the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting, so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billion of that is operating expenses. It then includes a number of things, positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture. Remember I've talked in the past about having a unique organization or global terminal organization, that is really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle cost. The number includes benefits in energy costs, it includes benefits from our asset management program, as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously, we've been talking about all these new projects coming on stream, well, with them comes an increase in the operating cost, and we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year. So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year-on-year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx. It includes a lot of same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that, that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our planned guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year-on-year reduction of CapEx was $7.5 billion, so we didn't really include the $4.5 billion in the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year-on-year, our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion."

One being the Kizomb Satellites Phase 2 and another one being Erha North Phase 2, that allows us to leverage existing knowledge, and develop the deepwater resource in a much more cost effective way.

Let me first say, for the group's benefit that one of our greatest strengths are our people. And I think those of us that went through the layoffs in the '80s really learned some of the hard lessons about how those layouts significantly impaired organizational effectiveness. I mean since then, we have been very diligent at managing employee headcount, given the cyclical nature of the business, and the need by the organization to be ever more productive, and at the same time, grow collective competency to meet the challenges in front of us. In doing so, I'd also say they've been unrelenting in -- on our focus at capturing efficiencies to make sure that we rightsize the organization, again, given the likelihood of business volatility. I'd also highlight, John, that another benefit of our integrated business model is that we're able to be agile in redeploying personnel to segments of our business that are experiencing market strength or growth such as our Downstream and Chemical businesses right now. All that said, our employee headcount has been coming down consistently since the Exxon and Mobil merger. We're down about 35% through 2015. Over that time period, if you look at just the last 5 years, we're down about 20%. And I can -- rest assured that the organization's going to continue to be focused on productivity enhancements and making sure that we're getting all the efficiencies out of the business."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Now turning to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we've consistently applied for decades, along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project execution and effective cost management. While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses. 
ExxonMobil completed 6 major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, the United States and West Africa added 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth. Strong operating performance of the base portfolio, along with these project conditions, delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans. The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the U.S., estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate with significant volatility in the financial sector and Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness, whereas Europe's economy remained stable with continued tepid growth. Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions, and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. Furthermore, global refining and chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations. 
Turning now to the financial results on -- shown on Slide 5. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. The corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $500 million was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion, and debt was $38.7 billion. 
The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. Uses included net investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short-term borrowing by about $4 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. 
In the sequential comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from year ago quarter. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel, and gas was down $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts, including U.S. deferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14% where ramp-up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, partly offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million, where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter. And natural gas prices were down $0.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth, along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects and new project start-ups. 
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes/mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million, respectively. All other items increased earnings $170 million, primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects, partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower U.S. maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales, partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects. 
Moving now to the Chemical financial operating results starting on Slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million, while favorable volumes/mix added $80 million. Other items decreased earnings $160 million primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities. 
Turning now to the full year financial results starting on Slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. The corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx totaled about $31 billion for the year, a reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion. 
Turning to Slide 18. Cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year. 
Moving to Slide 19. Graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion funded shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justified the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows, along with our financial strength, provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand. 
Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Total dividends per share of $2.88 are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. In the first quarter of 2016, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. During 2015, ExxonMobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015. 
So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on investment plans at our upcoming Analyst Meeting.
Moving now to Slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs. 
Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on Slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume/mix effects increased earnings $810 million were contributions, major project start-ups over the last couple of years as well as our work program activities were partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses. Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by asset high-grading, including the start-up of new development projects. 
Moving to Slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlements impacts, which were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production, however, was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the U.S., along with higher entitlements. 
Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on Slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by increased maintenance, reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. 
On Slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes/mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains. 
Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher-value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. Six major project start-ups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progressed development of our high-quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015. In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next 2 years. We expect to start up 6 of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity. 
Moving now to Slide 26. We continue to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to ExxonMobil's asset portfolio while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history is nearly complete, and we will begin appraising the lease of discovery during the first quarter. We also acquired a 35% interest and operatorship for the Canje Block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, adding over 520,000 net acres. 
In the Romanian Black Sea, ExxonMobil has completed exploration activities in the Neptun Block after successfully drilling 7 consecutive wells since July 2014. Based on the results of the program, including a successful well test of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies. And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuquén province. The program consists of 5 wells, along with construction and production facilities and a gas pipeline. Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. ExxonMobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 in offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres. 
In Canada, we're awarded interest in 3 blocks, offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in a proven oil-equivalent hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build on our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest and are currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres. 
So would now like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. ExxonMobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value through the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results. Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Buying the contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce cost. In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion. 
Our commitment to shareholders remains strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. Now we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with a live webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

The CapEx guidance that we've provided for 2016 of $23.2 billion is all in. It includes consolidated and equity companies, and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015. To answer your first question, I'd first like to say that, as I said in my prepared comments, we were down in the year in 2015, both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings in a soft business climate. There was reduced activity, and then importantly, timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects our prudent cash management and our continued investment through the cycle in attractive, high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value. The short of it is that we're going to continue to live within our means. We're going to maintain the financial flexibility. And we've got -- as you heard us talk in the past, we've got a very diverse, high-quality inventory investment opportunities that we'll continue to progress."

As we said at the time of this discovery, we're very encouraged with the initial results, recognizing that we only have 1 well in a very, very large block, over 6.5 million acres. We have since the discovery move quickly to get a drill ship contracted and on site to appraise the discovery, and we expect that to spud very shortly. As I said, the seismic acquisition is nearing completion. The results from both the well as well as the seismic are being actively assessed to assess the full block potential as well as the commercial viability of the lease of discovery. Obviously, the objective of the first well is an appraisal well and lease head, and it's intended to give us important information to size the resource as well as get a test on it to assess the key variables associated with the commercial viability. So I would tell you that there are early studies underway on potential development options for the field, but I don't have anything more to share on that."

I mean, Sam, it's a great question because LNG clearly is a key component of our portfolio, and it is an important part of our margin generation. Remember, we're constructive on long-term demand. For gas, as you just saw the recent update on our energy outlook, we got gas growing about 1.6% per year. LNG is anticipated to triple between now and 2040. So we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term. I will tell you that for , let's use PNG as a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did an exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is get more out of the asset, and we were able to get it up to in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result, and we're still going. So it's a good example of how we really continue to manage the existing assets, to reduce the cost structure and prove operational reliability to maximize long-term asset value."

Whatever -- we have built this business to ensure that it's durable in a low-price environment. And then any upsurge from that is additional return on the investment. So the organization is very focused on really managing the fundamentals. As I indicated we're -- for both gas and oil, we're constructive on long-term demand growth. And it's the fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we've put in place. And if you look near term, demand has been growing about 1 million barrels per day per year. And although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have -- I mean, the first half of this year, we have about 1.5 million barrels a day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as seasonal demand increases. We got to come in balance, but we have seen historically, we do have a bit of a buildup in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG is, as I said previously, that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040."

I mean and as I said, we'll talk about -- more about our investment plans and our thoughts on volumes next month in the Analyst Meeting. But a couple things to share with you. Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to the 2014 was primarily a result of a drop-off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously, in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build in to our spend pattern. As we go forward, I would tell you right now, most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It does -- it's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we have slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward. But short of that, I really don't have any more specifics to share as to breaking the CapEx spend down further. We'll continue to live within our means, as we've shown historically.

Decision on the buyback, as we've said before, our capital allocation approach is really focused on the dual priority of funding attractive investments and continuing to provide a reliable and growing dividend. And the share buybacks have always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. As we continued to progress in a very challenging business climate, you saw us prudently taper back the buyback program.

Once again, it's a conscious decision to be measured in our investment program. When we saw the big ramp up in rigs back in 2014, 2015, we're very measured in how we ramped up, because we wanted to ensure that we fully developed the learning curve and capture those real cost benefits that translate into higher value as we fully develop these fields. So the investments that we're making right now are economic, they're attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got. We're one of the few that can continue to invest in the down cycle. We've high graded our -- all the services that we get in our unconventional business.

Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth has come at the expense of returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other super majors too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation, especially when considering that the valuation for some of the big oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level the past 2 decades and in some cases, 3 decades. So my question is whether or not the issues of structured returns and growth are being revisited internally maybe more so than in the past? Or is that what is implied in the new spending outlook that you talked about today? And then also, whether or not returns on capital, which I didn't see mentioned in the presentation, is still as relevant as it used to be. So 2 questions."

Well, Doug, on the first one, I mean your point about value creation in our investment program, we couldn't agree with you more. And I would tell you that it is never -- our view has never changed on the importance of making the right value choices. We saw back in the -- I'd say, in the early 2000s to the mid-2010 time frame, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we can make an investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture, that ultimately was going to improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of nonproductive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came on stream, that they were going to be accretive to our overall average financial performance. So unfortunately, as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless, we still very -- feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus has been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately, we believe that the, these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so had an impact on our return on capital employed, are going to be accretive to our financial performance over the long term, and believe they were the right decision. Now to your second question, on return on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us. We believe it is a fundamental measure that differentiates us, and that's why we continue to talk about it. We have never lost sight of the importance of that metric relative to the investment decisions that we're making."

First, let me just make sure everybody understands the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting, so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billion of that is operating expenses. It then includes a number of things, positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture. Remember I've talked in the past about having a unique organization or global terminal organization, that is really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle cost. The number includes benefits in energy costs, it includes benefits from our asset management program, as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously, we've been talking about all these new projects coming on stream, well, with them comes an increase in the operating cost, and we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year. So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year-on-year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx. It includes a lot of same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that, that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our planned guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year-on-year reduction of CapEx was $7.5 billion, so we didn't really include the $4.5 billion in the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year-on-year, our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. 
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment, marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business, enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control, including effective cost management, reliable performance and operational integrity. Our highlight this quarter is our strong Chemical results, which underscores significant gas and liquids-cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across the value chain. Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter, we benefited from recent capacity additions, while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. 
We continue to effectively manage our spending while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand, and importantly, grow shareholder value.
Moving now to Slide 4. We'll provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the U.S., estimates indicate growth has slowed further since late 2015. In China, growth continued to decelerate. However, economies in Japan and Europe seemed -- showed some modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last quarter, while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distillate demand and continued surplus inventory. However, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower FID and energy costs.
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just over $5 billion, down $2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015, reflecting continued steady progress on our investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.8 billion and debt was $43.1 billion.
Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion, which included an impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. 
ExxonMobil will continue to limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and programs, but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. 
Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.75 per share, a 2.7% increase from last quarter, marking our 34th consecutive year of per-share dividend growth.
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings decreased $3.1 billion from a year-ago quarter. Our Upstream and Downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Chemical results and lower corporate costs. The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter, down from 33% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and onetime favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
In the sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $970 million as stronger Chemical results partly offset lower Upstream and Downstream earnings.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Upstream earnings decreased $2.9 billion from a year-ago quarter, resulting in the segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel, and gas realizations fell more than $2.25 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million. All other items decreased earnings another $250 million, where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced operating expenses.
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8% to more than 4.3 million barrels per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Now liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5%, driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio. 
However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts and lower entitlement volumes.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion, where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas fell almost $0.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million, including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million, reflecting lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower favorable tax effects.
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes were also up 77,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day, up 2.3% from ramp-up of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up 120 million cubic feet per day, reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements.
Moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million, a decrease of $760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $860 million, partly offset by $100 million of all other items, primarily favorable foreign exchange effects.
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by $470 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects, mainly from increased European maintenance activities, decreased earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset adding $170 million, mostly from lower expenses.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $1.4 billion, up $370 million versus the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by $250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million, while all other items added another $40 million, again from lower expenses.
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses.
Turning now to Slide 17. As you may be aware, Standard & Poor's reduced its credit rating on ExxonMobil by 1 notch to AA+ with a stable outlook. Earlier this month, Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the corporation with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the corporation's conservative financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive terms remain strong. ExxonMobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. 
ExxonMobil has a long history of prudently managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles, and we fully expect to manage this one under those same prudent financial principles. 
Moving now to Slide 18 and an update on Upstream projects and the exploration program. Four major project startups year-to-date added 170,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January, the Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is a 5-well subsea development in 5,300 feet of water tied back to a central thrust far production facility with a peak capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day.
In Australia, train 1 of the Gorgon LNG project started out in March. As you know, LNG production has been suspended due to mechanical issues, which the operator is actively working to resolve. 
In April, ExxonMobil started up 2 more projects ahead of schedule and under budget. Julia, in the Gulf of Mexico and the Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's north slope. Julia is a capital-efficient subsea tieback to an existing production facility, another example of ExxonMobil's capability to cost effectively develop new deepwater resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Construction will continue to ramp up in the coming months as 2 additional wells are completed. 
At the Point Thomson project, 2 injection wells will work in tandem with the production well, cycling up to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day to an on-site central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of condensate. Notably, the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope and further demonstrates ExxonMobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote environments. 
Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year, namely Kashigan and Varzan, closing out to 6 major project startups planned for 2016.
Turning now to our exploration program, where we continue to pursue and evaluate high-value resource opportunities. Offshore Guyana, we completed the largest proprietary 3D seismic survey in our company's history, and we are currently drilling the Lisa 2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to evaluate the block's potential and development concepts. We plan to drill additional exploration wells with the existing rig. 
Offshore Uruguay, we are participating in the Rhea 1 exploration well in block 14, where we have a 35% interest. And in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent high bidder on 5 new exploration blocks in lease sale 241. Final award of these blocks is expected later this year, and we'll further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. Plan to utilize proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build a portfolio of attractive future drilling opportunities. 
So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self-help initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, improving reliability and capturing incremental margin across the integrated portfolio. First quarter, the corporation earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business climate, benefiting from structural advantages in our Downstream and Chemical operations. The business generated $5 billion from cash flow from operations and asset sales. We continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing Upstream production volumes from 4.3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as a reliable operator. ExxonMobil paid $3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter, sharing the corporation's success directly with our shareholders, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

I think on the first item I'd tell you just stepping back a little bit on the Downstream, our fuel margins were weaker with distillate margins being at 5-year lows due to, as you're much aware, global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories. And obviously, that was aggravated by warm winter and a low heating oil demand. And particularly in the U.S., less demand in the energy sector. Although gasoline margins remained strong and demand is growing above capacity growth. We saw, as I said in my prepared comments, that from a volume perspective, we had to increase maintenance activity predominantly in Europe in the first quarter of this year. If you compare it sequentially first quarter to fourth quarter, we had a much higher load on plant maintenance. I will say broadly speaking, Doug, in 2016, our overall plant maintenance will be lower than 2015. But we will have a fairly heavy first half."

So I think it's a good indication of pretty healthy demand increase, very consistent with our outlook for energy, with oil growth growing about 0.6% [ph] per year and gas crowing about 1.7% -- or 1.6% for the year."

The return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us. You've heard us talk in the past about a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major Upstream projects concurrently in order to capture the very unique value that probably no one else could capture like ExxonMobil. And that had a draw -- a burden on the return on capital employed for a period of time. But rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value. And we still view the return on capital employed as a key metric in the end as to how effective our value choices are."

For our long-cycle investments, it's really a function of project maturity that actually maximizes value best, keeping in mind our prudent financial management to ensure that we're meeting our commitments and maintaining financial flexibility. Now for the shorter-cycle investments that you're really asking about, by and large, it is the same, but with a much narrower focus on the near-term business climate. So it's not really a price trigger for us, it's really a combination of all the relevant factors to ensure that we're maintaining our very prudent financial management, but at the same time, ensure that we have financial flexibility, continue to invest when the opportunities come along. And as you know, I mean, we're spending $23 billion this year, which represents a lot of investment activity."

Obviously, as our inventory base grew in the lower 48 unconventional. But our fundamentals on how we manage the business hasn't changed at all. And the choices that we're making our really driven by how do we maximize shareholder value. All these investments compete. And as we've said previously, we are not opportunity-constrained. We've got a very, very deep inventory across the portfolio not only in the Upstream, but also in our Downstream and Chemical business and then just making sure that when we progress a project an investment decision that we have identified the optimized value proposition for it, and it's competing for that capital across the portfolio. So I wouldn't tell you that we ever said the targets are around segmenting the total investment program between long cycle and short cycle.

The margin benefit is primarily FID and energy dropping quicker than product realizations. I'd also say, though, that our gas crackers continue to be advantaged. Even though the liquid crackers margins have improved, the gas crackers here in North America continue to have a very advantaged feedstock slate that allows us to compete very strongly in the demand market globally."

I mean, generally speaking, the oil sands certainly, no doubt profitability is compressed in this price environment. But the organization, once again, keeps very focused on the fundamentals, particularly our costs and reliability, and they're making really good progress. They're finding structural enhancements that create margin at the bottom line. If you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands, we've been working the oil sands now for over 3 decades, including technology development. And on the mining side, I think Kearl is a great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment. Our operating cost and improve our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value. The same is true for the in-situ operations. I mean, we've been optimizing our cyclics team operations at Cold Lake for a long time. We're identifying additional technology benefits like solvent-assisted steam, assisted gravity drainage technology that will improve, once again, the recovery and lower our costs and improve our environmental footprint. I think it's a testament to how ExxonMobil manages its portfolio. We work the project management and execution very, very well. And then when it starts up, they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin because we know we can't count on price. What we got to count on is things that we control, that being cost and reliability and our integrity of the operations.

Second thing I'd say, and it's just a little more expansion from what I was sharing with Doug earlier, is that underlying demand growth has been generally strong. And we expect this year will be in excess of the 10-year average. Now I'd say that in the first half of 2016, we're still oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels per day. We do expect to see convergence in the second half with seasonal demand growth, but that's going to widen again in the first half of 2017. And remember, during this period of oversupply, we've been building up commercial inventories since about year-end 2013. So thinking forward, we are seeing a convergence over supply and demand into the future, but we've got this overhead of supply that's going to also have to work off over time. So we're heading in the right direction. In terms of how when that will happen will be anybody's guess. Remember, there's still a fair bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply trend and the economic growth near term.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter Earnings Call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to",1902,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter Earnings Call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. 
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment, marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business, enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control, including effective cost management, reliable performance and operational integrity.
A highlight this quarter is our strong Chemical results, which underscores significant gas and liquids-cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across the value chain. Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter, we benefited from recent capacity additions, while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. 
We continue to effectively manage our spending, while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand and, importantly, grow shareholder value.
Moving now to Slide 4. We'll provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the U.S., estimates indicate growth has slowed further since late 2015. In China, growth continued to decelerate. However, economies in Japan and Europe seemed -- showed some modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last quarter, while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distillate demand and continued surplus inventory. However, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower feed and energy costs.
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just over $5 billion, down $2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015, reflecting continued, steady progress on our investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.8 billion and debt was $43.1 billion.
Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion, which included an impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. ExxonMobil will continue to limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and programs, but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. 
Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.75 per share, a 2.7% increase from last quarter, marking our 34th consecutive year of per-share dividend growth.
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings decreased $3.1 billion from a year-ago quarter. Our Upstream and Downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Chemical results and lower corporate costs. The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter, down from 33% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and onetime favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
In the sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $970 million, as stronger Chemical results partly offset lower Upstream and Downstream earnings.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Upstream earnings decreased $2.9 billion from a year-ago quarter, resulting in a segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel, and gas realizations fell more than $2.25 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million. All other items decreased earnings another $250 million, where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced operating expenses.
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8% to more than 4.3 million barrels per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Our liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5%, driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio. However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts and lower entitlement volumes.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion, where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas fell almost $0.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million, including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million, reflecting lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower favorable tax effects.
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes were also up 77,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day, up 2.3% from ramp-up of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up 120 million cubic feet per day, reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements.
Moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million, a decrease of $760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $860 million, partly offset by $100 million of all other items, primarily favorable foreign exchange effects.
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by $470 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects, mainly from increased European maintenance activities, decreased earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset, adding $170 million, mostly from lower expenses.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $1.4 billion, up $370 million versus the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by $250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million, while all other items added another $40 million, again from lower expenses.
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses.
Turning now to Slide 17. As you may be aware, Standard & Poor's reduced its credit rating on ExxonMobil by 1 notch to AA+ with a stable outlook. Earlier this month, Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the corporation with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the corporation's conservative financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive terms remains strong. ExxonMobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. 
ExxonMobil has a long history of prudently managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles, and we fully expect to manage through this one under those same prudent financial principles. 
Moving now to Slide 18 in an update on Upstream projects and the exploration program. Four major project startups year-to-date added 170,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January, the Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is a 5-well subsea development in 5,300 feet of water tied back to a central truss spar production facility, with a peak capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day.
In Australia, train 1 of the Gorgon LNG project started out in March. As you know, LNG production has been suspended due to mechanical issues, which the operator is actively working to resolve. 
In April, ExxonMobil started up 2 more projects ahead of schedule and under budget: Julia in the Gulf of Mexico; and the Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's North Slope. Julia is a capital-efficient subsea tie-back to an existing production facility, another example of ExxonMobil's capability to cost effectively develop new deepwater resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Construction [ph] will continue to ramp up in the coming months as 2 additional wells are completed. 
At the Point Thomson project, 2 injection wells will work in tandem with a production well, cycling up to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day to an on-site central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of condensate. Notably, the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope and further demonstrates ExxonMobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote environments. 
Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year, namely, Kashagan and Barzan, closing out to 6 major project startups planned for 2016.
Turning now to our exploration program, where we continue to pursue and evaluate high-value resource opportunities. Offshore Guyana, we completed the largest proprietary 3D seismic survey in our company's history, and we are currently drilling the Liza-2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to evaluate the block's potential and development concepts. We plan to drill additional exploration wells with the existing rig. 
Offshore Uruguay, we are participating in the Raya-1 exploration well in Block 14 where we have a 35% interest. And in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent high bidder on 5 new exploration blocks in lease sale 241. Final award of these blocks is expected later this year, and we'll further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. We plan to utilize proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build a portfolio of attractive future drilling opportunities. 
So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self-help initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, improving reliability and capturing incremental margin across the integrated portfolio.
In the [ph] first quarter, the corporation earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business climate, benefiting from structural advantages in our Downstream and Chemical operations. Integrated business generated $5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. We continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing Upstream production volumes to 4.3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as a reliable operator.
ExxonMobil paid $3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter, sharing the corporation's success directly with our shareholders, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

I think on the first item, I'd tell you, just stepping back a little bit on the Downstream, our fuel margins were weaker with distillate margins being at 5-year lows due to, as you're much aware, global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories. And obviously, that was aggravated by a warm winter and a low heating oil demand, and particularly in the U.S., less demand in the energy sector. Although gasoline margins remained strong, and demand is growing above capacity growth. We saw, as I said in my prepared comments, that from a volume perspective, we had to increase maintenance activity predominantly in Europe in the first quarter of this year. If you compare it sequentially, first quarter to fourth quarter, we had a much higher load on plant maintenance. I will say, broadly speaking, Doug, in 2016, our overall plant maintenance will be lower than 2015, but we will have a fairly heavy first half."

The return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us. You've heard us talk in the past, Doug, about a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major Upstream projects concurrently in order to capture very unique value that probably no one else could capture like ExxonMobil. And that had a draw -- a burden on the return on capital employed for a period of time. But rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value.

Now for the shorter-cycle investments that you're really asking about, by and large, it is the same, but with a much narrower focus on the near-term business climate.

But the organization, once again, keeps very focused on the fundamentals, particularly our costs and reliability, and they're making really good progress. They're finding structural enhancements that create margin at the bottom line. If you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands, we've been working the oil sands now for over 3 decades, including technology development. And on the mining side, I think Kearl is a great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment, our operating cost and improved our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value. The same is true for the in-situ operations. I mean, we've been optimizing our cyclic scheme operations at Cold Lake for a long time. We're identifying additional technology benefits like Solvent Assisted-Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology that will improve, once again, the recovery and lower our cost and improve our environmental footprint. I think it's a testament to how ExxonMobil manages its portfolio. We work the project management and execution very, very well. And then when it starts up, they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin because we know we can't count on price.

It's all about maintaining prudent cash management, maintaining our financial flexibility. We're going to be continue to be disciplined in our investment approach.

Second thing I'd say, and it's just a little more expansion from what I was sharing with Doug earlier, is that underlying demand growth has been generally strong. And we expect this year will be in excess of the 10-year average. Now I would say that in the first half of 2016, we're still oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels per day. We do expect to see convergence in the second half with seasonal demand growth, but that's going to widen again in the first half of 2017. And remember, during this period of oversupply, we've been building up commercial inventories since about year-end 2013. So thinking forward, we are seeing a convergence over supply and demand into the future, but we've got this overhead of supply that's going to also have to work off over time. So we're heading in the right direction. In terms of how and when that will happen will be anybody's guess. Remember, there's still a fair bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply trend and the economic growth near term.

And if you'll recall in the analyst presentation, we provide a little bit more insight as to the type of projects and their potential capacity they can bring on over the time horizon. Now of course, what we need to do is we need to make sure that as we mature, the inventory projects that we're doing it with the greatest value proposition. And I think we've made great strides in finding unique opportunities in order to reduce the cost structure going forward. I'd say, though, Paul that we've been through these cycles for a long time. We've been able to maintain a very strong balance sheet. We've maintained our financial flexibility through the ups and downs, and our inventory looks very attractive going forward. So we think all the elements are set right to continue to invest in an attractive way to maintain our industry-leading return on capital employed. The other point I'd remind you is that as we showed in the analyst presentation, we have done very well in terms of efficiency of deploying investment dollars. If you recall, the Upstream capital efficiency chart that we used in the analyst presentation showing our capital employed over proved reserves, clearly we're distinguishing ourselves relative to others."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter Earnings Call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to",1901,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter Earnings Call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. 
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment, marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business, enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control, including effective cost management, reliable performance and operational integrity.
A highlight this quarter is our strong Chemical results, which underscores significant gas and liquids-cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across the value chain. Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter, we benefited from recent capacity additions, while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. 
We continue to effectively manage our spending, while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand and, importantly, grow shareholder value.
Moving now to Slide 4. We'll provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the U.S., estimates indicate growth has slowed further since late 2015. In China, growth continued to decelerate. However, economies in Japan and Europe seemed -- showed some modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last quarter, while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distillate demand and continued surplus inventory. However, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower feed and energy costs.
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just over $5 billion, down $2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015, reflecting continued, steady progress on our investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.8 billion and debt was $43.1 billion.
Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion, which included an impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. ExxonMobil will continue to limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and programs, but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. 
Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.75 per share, a 2.7% increase from last quarter, marking our 34th consecutive year of per-share dividend growth.
Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings decreased $3.1 billion from a year-ago quarter. Our Upstream and Downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Chemical results and lower corporate costs. The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter, down from 33% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and onetime favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. 
In the sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $970 million, as stronger Chemical results partly offset lower Upstream and Downstream earnings.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Upstream earnings decreased $2.9 billion from a year-ago quarter, resulting in a segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel, and gas realizations fell more than $2.25 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million. All other items decreased earnings another $250 million, where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced operating expenses.
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8% to more than 4.3 million barrels per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Our liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5%, driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio. However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts and lower entitlement volumes.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion, where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas fell almost $0.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million, including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million, reflecting lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower favorable tax effects.
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes were also up 77,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day, up 2.3% from ramp-up of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up 120 million cubic feet per day, reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements.
Moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million, a decrease of $760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $860 million, partly offset by $100 million of all other items, primarily favorable foreign exchange effects.
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by $470 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects, mainly from increased European maintenance activities, decreased earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset, adding $170 million, mostly from lower expenses.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $1.4 billion, up $370 million versus the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by $250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million, while all other items added another $40 million, again from lower expenses.
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses.
Turning now to Slide 17. As you may be aware, Standard & Poor's reduced its credit rating on ExxonMobil by 1 notch to AA+ with a stable outlook. Earlier this month, Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the corporation with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the corporation's conservative financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive terms remains strong. ExxonMobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. 
ExxonMobil has a long history of prudently managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles, and we fully expect to manage through this one under those same prudent financial principles. 
Moving now to Slide 18 in an update on Upstream projects and the exploration program. Four major project startups year-to-date added 170,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January, the Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is a 5-well subsea development in 5,300 feet of water tied back to a central truss spar production facility, with a peak capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day.
In Australia, train 1 of the Gorgon LNG project started out in March. As you know, LNG production has been suspended due to mechanical issues, which the operator is actively working to resolve. 
In April, ExxonMobil started up 2 more projects ahead of schedule and under budget: Julia in the Gulf of Mexico; and the Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's North Slope. Julia is a capital-efficient subsea tie-back to an existing production facility, another example of ExxonMobil's capability to cost effectively develop new deepwater resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Production will continue to ramp up in the coming months as 2 additional wells are completed. 
At the Point Thomson project, 2 injection wells will work in tandem with a production well, cycling up to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day to an on-site central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of condensate. Notably, the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope and further demonstrates ExxonMobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote environments. 
Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year, namely, Kashagan and Barzan, closing out to 6 major project startups planned for 2016.
Turning now to our exploration program, where we continue to pursue and evaluate high-value resource opportunities. Offshore Guyana, we completed the largest proprietary 3D seismic survey in our company's history, and we are currently drilling the Liza-2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to evaluate the block's potential and development concepts. We plan to drill additional exploration wells with the existing rig. 
Offshore Uruguay, we are participating in the Raya-1 exploration well in Block 14 where we have a 35% interest. And in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent high bidder on 5 new exploration blocks in lease sale 241. Final award of these blocks is expected later this year, and we'll further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. We plan to utilize proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build a portfolio of attractive future drilling opportunities. 
So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self-help initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, improving reliability and capturing incremental margin across the integrated portfolio.
In the [ph] first quarter, the corporation earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business climate, benefiting from structural advantages in our Downstream and Chemical operations. Integrated business generated $5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. We continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing Upstream production volumes to 4.3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as a reliable operator.
ExxonMobil paid $3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter, sharing the corporation's success directly with our shareholders, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

I think on the first item, I'd tell you, just stepping back a little bit on the Downstream, our fuel margins were weaker with distillate margins being at 5-year lows due to, as you're much aware, global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories. And obviously, that was aggravated by a warm winter and a low heating oil demand, and particularly in the U.S., less demand in the energy sector. Although gasoline margins remained strong, and demand is growing above capacity growth. We saw, as I said in my prepared comments, that from a volume perspective, we had to increase maintenance activity predominantly in Europe in the first quarter of this year. If you compare it sequentially, first quarter to fourth quarter, we had a much higher load on plant maintenance. I will say, broadly speaking, Doug, in 2016, our overall plant maintenance will be lower than 2015, but we will have a fairly heavy first half."

So I think it's a good indication of a pretty healthy demand increase, very consistent with our outlook for energy, with oil growth growing about 0.6% per year and gas growing about 1.7% -- or 1.6% per year."

The return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us. You've heard us talk in the past, Doug, about a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major Upstream projects concurrently in order to capture very unique value that probably no one else could capture like ExxonMobil. And that had a draw -- a burden on the return on capital employed for a period of time. But rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value. And we still view the return on capital employed as a key metric in the end as to how effective our value choices are."

And then just making sure that when we progress a project, an investment decision, that we have identified the optimized value proposition for it, and it's competing for that capital across the portfolio.

But the organization, once again, keeps very focused on the fundamentals, particularly our costs and reliability, and they're making really good progress. They're finding structural enhancements that create margin at the bottom line. If you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands, we've been working the oil sands now for over 3 decades, including technology development. And on the mining side, I think Kearl is a great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment, our operating costs and improved our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value. The same is true for the in-situ operations. I mean, we've been optimizing our cyclic scheme operations at Cold Lake for a long time. We're identifying additional technology benefits like Solvent Assisted-Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology that will improve, once again, the recovery and lower our cost and improve our environmental footprint. I think it's a testament to how ExxonMobil manages its portfolio. We work the project management and execution very, very well. And then when it starts up, they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin because we know we can't count on price.

So we've got significant flexibility within the Chemical business to modify the feedstock in order to maximize margins.

So of course, the organization, and you've heard me talk previously, Roger, about the global procurement business. But it's all focused around finding the lowest life cycle cost.

And we're going to keep focused on the things that we control. Second thing I'd say, and it's just a little more expansion from what I was sharing with Doug earlier, is that underlying demand growth has been generally strong. And we expect this year will be in excess of the 10-year average. Now I would say that in the first half of 2016, we're still oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels per day. We do expect to see convergence in the second half with seasonal demand growth, but that's going to widen again in the first half of 2017. And remember, during this period of oversupply, we've been building up commercial inventories since about year-end 2013. So thinking forward, we are seeing a convergence over supply and demand into the future, but we've got this overhead of supply that's going to also have to work off over time. So we're heading in the right direction. In terms of how and when that will happen will be anybody's guess. Remember, there's still a fair bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply trend and the economic growth near term. But clearly we're seeing, as you are all aware, we're seeing North America supply dropping off pretty significantly now."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter Earnings Call. The comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. 
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our cash flow reflects the durability of the integrated portfolio amid industry volatility. In particular, strong Chemical results highlight sustainable competitive advantages, including gas and liquids-cracking capabilities, along with our differentiated product portfolio. Our financial flexibility enables us to selectively advance new investment opportunities across the value chain, and I'll provide an update on several of these new investments later in the presentation. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic conditions were mixed in the second quarter. U.S. growth recovered modestly relative to the weak first quarter, and China showed signs of stabilization. However, Europe and Japan experienced slower growth. Crude oil prices increased, whereas average global natural gas prices decreased sequentially. Global refining margins benefited from the improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. However, Chemical product margins weakened due to higher FID and energy costs. 
Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $5.2 billion, down 38% from the second quarter of last year, reflecting both prudent capital management and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $44.5 billion. 
The next slide provides additional details on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.8 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.3 billion. 
Moving now on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings decreased $2.5 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs in the quarter were in line with our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. 
In the sequential quarter comparison showed on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $110 million, as stronger Upstream results partly offset lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate charges. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Second quarter Upstream earnings were $294 million, down $1.7 billion from a year-ago quarter. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion. Crude prices declined by over $16 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $50 million, and all other items added another $450 million, reflecting reduced operating expenses, the absence of an unfavorable onetime impact from the Alberta tax increase and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production was comparable to the second quarter of last year at about 4 million barrels per day. Liquids production was up 39,000 barrels per day, whereas growth from recent project startups was partly offset by the impact of fuel decline, downtime events, notably in Nigeria and in Canada with the wildfires in Alberta. Natural gas production, however, decreased 366 million cubic feet per day, including fuel decline, downtime and divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $370 million higher than the first quarter. Realizations improved earnings by $960 million. Crude increased nearly $12.50 per barrel. However, gas realizations decreased by over $0.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and sales mix effects, including lower seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher downtime reduced earnings by $280 million. All other items further decreased earnings by $310 million, including higher exploration expenses, lower gains from asset sales and less favorable tax items. 
Moving now to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 368,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.5%. Liquid production decreased 208,000 barrels per day, mostly from downtime events and entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 962 million cubic feet per day on seasonally lower European demand. 
So moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $825 million, a decrease of $681 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $850 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from improved U.S. reliability and lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $40 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $81 million. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $80 million, while favorable marketing volumes added $20 million. Other items reduced earnings $180 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance costs.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Second quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from both gas and liquids cracking contributed $150 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $70 million, while all other items reduced earnings $250 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains. 
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased $138 million due to weaker margins and increased maintenance activity. 
Next several charts will provide an update on how the corporation's advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage. Chart 17 showcases a good opportunity to add quality resources to our successful LNG operation in Papua New Guinea. ExxonMobil has a long and successful history in the global LNG business and is proud to have started up the Papua New Guinea LNG project ahead of schedule, given its many complexities. In 2015, PNG LNG produced 7.4 million tons per annum, exceeding the original design capacity of 6.9 million tons by 7%. 
We continue to safely increase plant throughput and improve reliability at low cost. And in this regard, in June, we achieved an annualized rate of 8.2 million tons per annum, the highest monthly rate since startup. 
Built on this success, ExxonMobil recently announced plans to acquire Interoil Corporation in a transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, which includes consideration of $45 per share to be paid in ExxonMobil's stock. The agreement also includes a contingent payment, which is based on the resource certification of the discovered, undeveloped Elk Antelope field and is payable about 6.2 trillion cubic feet up to a maximum of 10 trillion cubic feet. 
Finally, the agreement is subject to Interoil's shareholder approval and the other customer and closing conditions and regulatory reviews. This acquisition provides ExxonMobil access to 6 additional licenses in Papua New Guinea, totaling about 4 million acres. Elk Antelope complements our existing discovered, undeveloped resources, such as Penn Yan, better positioning the co-ventures to expand the existing operation with additional LNG trains. The transaction will allow ExxonMobil to create unique value for shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea, and we look forward to working closely with co-ventures, the government, customers, and importantly, local communities to grow the successful business. 
Moving now to Slide 18 for an update on Upstream projects and exploration activities we were advancing several attractive new investment opportunities. ExxonMobil is on track to achieve 10 major project startups in 2016 and 2017, of which 4 have already initiated production. 
As shown on the photo, excellent progress continues at Hebron, located offshore Eastern Canada. The utilities and process module fabrication is now complete, and it was successfully loaded out in June from the fabrication yard in Korea for transport to Newfoundland and Labrador where it will then be installed on the gravity-based structure. Hebron remains on track for a late-2017 startup. 
In Abu Dhabi, production is steadily increasing in the Upper Zakum field. 8 drilling rigs are operating on the artificial islands, where gross production has reached 100,000 barrels per day. Aggregate Upper Zakum gross production is currently about 670,000 barrels per day, and production is anticipated to reach 750,000 barrels per day by 2018. 
ExxonMobil also recently sanctioned the expansion project, which is expected to increase crude oil production capacity by up to 300,000 barrels per day, with startup in 2022. ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder in, the operator of the field. 
Now offshore Guyana, we completed drilling operations on the Liza-2 appraisal well. The well test confirmed a world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource estimate of 800 million to 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The test also confirmed high-quality oil from the same high process reservoirs we saw in the Liza 1 discovery well. ExxonMobil, along with its partners, is progressing development planning activities on an early production concept, involving a floating production, storage and offloading facility, along with related subsea production systems. The final investment decision will be based on a variety of factors, including further Liza appraisal drilling, the regulatory approvals and market conditions. 
On July 17, we began building the jack project, which is located approximately 25 miles northwest the Liza 1 discovery well. This is the third well on the Stavro block. 
In addition to these activities, ExxonMobil recently entered into an agreement with the ratio companies to acquire a 50%-ish interest in the block offshore Guyana, and will become the operator. is approximately 250 kilometers offshore Guyana in ultra deepwater north and adjacent to the stop broke and Kanji blocks. Pending government approval, this deal will bring our total acreage position in Guyana to 11.4 million acres over the 3 blocks. 
Chart 19 showcases improvements in our U.S. unconventional operator portfolio. ExxonMobil is a leading operator in the U.S. unconventional production. Since 2013, we have more than tripled our gross operated production from the liquids-rich Permian and Bakken plays. Approximately 85% of this is liquids. 
We have maintained a relentless focus on reducing cost and improving efficiency, while maintaining high operational integrity. We have continued to reduce drilling cost per foot, implement efficiencies and capture market savings to achieve substantial cost reductions. With longer lateral lengths and improved completion designs, per well hydrocarbon recovery has dramatically improved. Coupled with lower drilling and completion cost, this higher recovery has resulted in a nearly 70% reduction in Permian unit development cost over the past 2 years. Our development cost per barrel is now $8 in the Permian and less than $10 in the Bakken. 
Additionally, we have successfully reduced cash operating cost to approximately $8 per barrel. As a result of these cost improvements, a large part of the Permian drill well inventory is economic at prices around $40 per barrel. Over 2,000 drillable locations in Permian and Bakken yield a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel. This drillable inventory equates to 9 years of continuous drilling at 2015 rig levels, providing ExxonMobil the flexibility to progress profitable, short-cycle opportunities and adjust activity in response to market conditions. And as you can see on the chart, our economic drill well inventory increases significantly as energy demand and prices improve. 
Turning to Slide 20 and an update on our Downstream and Chemical businesses, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales. First, we recently completed the expansion of our Taicang lubricants plant. This facility employs innovative blending technologies that increase operating efficiency and enables us to support growing demand for premium lubricants in China. 
In the Chemical business, we launched Exceed XP performance polymers, which expands our comprehensive slate of polyethylene products. This new product provides leading performance in a variety of film applications, including consumer, construction and agricultural use. Exceed XP was developed using advanced catalyst technology, process recert and applications expertise. ExxonMobil recently announced a facility expansion of our Santoprene plant in the United Kingdom to meet growing demand for specialty elastomers for the automotive, consumer and industrial segments. 
Additionally, we announced a project at the Beaumont refinery to expand ultra-low sulfur diesel and gasoline production by more than 40,000 barrels per day. The upgraded facilities will employ proprietary scan-finding technology to remove sulfur and maximize octane. 
Corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We are evaluating a new project with to build a world-scale ethane cracker and derivative units along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Sabic and ExxonMobil enjoy a long history of successful partnership. 
Most recently, we completed a joint specialty elastomer's project at our Kenya facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility builds on existing world-scale commodity assets to help meet growing demand for premium synthetic rubbers. 
Chart 21 illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. As cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10.5 billion funded shareholder distributions and together, with a moderate increases in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive advantage and the flexibility to selectively invest through the cycle. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Finally, ExxonMobil generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the first half of 2016, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. 
Moving to Slide 22. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil is delivering on its commitments and continues to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. At mid-year, the corporation has earned $3.5 billion and generated $10.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales amid volatile industry conditions, underscoring the resilience of our integrated business. 
Upstream volumes were 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and capital spending has been reduced 36% to $10.3 billion. As you just heard, we continue to advance our investment plans to extend competitive advantage and unlock value across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses. And we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled $6.2 billion. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and now I'd be happy to take your questions."

Now like any type of commodity, there are going to be periods of oversupply and periods of shortness. And we do expect that through -- into the early part of the next decade that there will be some oversupply. But we keep focused on long-term value proposition. And I've always said, the energy outlook is one of providing us the insights and informing us for our investment choices. The Papua New Guinea, as I said in my prepared comments, has been just a remarkable outcome. The organization is really proud of the results, and we think we've got a really strong business there. And frankly, I think a brownfield expansion of the existing facility is going to compete very strongly for additional LNG demand in the future. I think we're very well positioned with the experience that we've got in country, the relationship that we have with the communities and with the government, our marketing capability.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our cash flow reflects the durability of the integrated portfolio amid industry volatility. In particular, strong Chemical results highlight sustainable competitive advantages, including gas and liquids-cracking capabilities, along with our differentiated product portfolio. Our financial flexibility enables us to selectively advance new investment opportunities across the value chain, and I'll provide an update on several of these new investments later in the presentation. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic conditions were mixed in the second quarter. U.S. growth recovered modestly relative to the weak first quarter, and China showed signs of stabilization. However, Europe and Japan experienced slower growth. Crude oil prices increased, whereas average global natural gas prices decreased sequentially. Global refining margins benefited from improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. However, Chemical product margins weakened due to higher feed and energy costs. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $5.2 billion, down 38% from the second quarter of last year, reflecting both prudent capital management and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $44.5 billion.
The next slide provides additional details on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.8 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.3 billion. 
Moving now on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings decreased $2.5 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs in the quarter were in line with our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years.
In the sequential quarter comparison showed on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $110 million, as stronger Upstream results partly offset lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate charges.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Second quarter Upstream earnings were $294 million, down $1.7 billion from a year-ago quarter. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion. Crude prices declined by over $16 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $50 million, and all other items added another $450 million, reflecting reduced operating expenses, the absence of an unfavorable onetime impact from the Alberta tax increase and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production was comparable to the second quarter of last year at about 4 million barrels per day. Liquids production was up 39,000 barrels per day, whereas growth from recent project startups was partly offset by the impact of fuel decline, downtime events, notably in Nigeria and in Canada with the wildfires in Alberta. Natural gas production, however, decreased 366 million cubic feet per day, including fuel decline, downtime and divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $370 million higher than the first quarter. Realizations improved earnings by $960 million. Crude increased nearly $12.50 per barrel. However, gas realizations decreased by over $0.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and sales mix effects, including lower seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher downtime reduced earnings by $280 million. All other items further decreased earnings by $310 million, including higher exploration expenses, lower gains from asset sales and less favorable tax items.
Moving now to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 368,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.5%. Liquid production decreased 208,000 barrels per day, mostly from downtime events and entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 962 million cubic feet per day on seasonally lower European demand.
So moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $825 million, a decrease of $681 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $850 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from improved U.S. reliability and lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $40 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $81 million. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $80 million, while favorable marketing volumes added $20 million. Other items reduced earnings $180 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance costs.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Second quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from both gas and liquids cracking contributed $150 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $70 million, while all other items reduced earnings $250 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains.
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased $138 million due to weaker margins and increased maintenance activity. 
Next several charts will provide an update on how the corporation's advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage. Chart 17 showcases a good opportunity to add quality resources to our successful LNG operation in Papua New Guinea. ExxonMobil has a long and successful history in the global LNG business and is proud to have started up the Papua New Guinea LNG project ahead of schedule, given its many complexities. In 2015, PNG LNG produced 7.4 million tons per annum, exceeding the original design capacity of 6.9 million tons by 7%.
We continue to safely increase plant throughput and improve reliability at low cost. And in this regard, in June, we achieved an annualized rate of 8.2 million tons per annum, the highest monthly rate since startup.
Built on this success, ExxonMobil recently announced plans to acquire Interoil Corporation in a transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, which includes consideration of $45 per share to be paid in ExxonMobil's stock. The agreement also includes a contingent payment, which is based on the resource certification of the discovered, undeveloped Elk Antelope field and is payable about 6.2 trillion cubic feet up to a maximum of 10 trillion cubic feet.
Finally, the agreement is subject to Interoil's shareholder approval and the other customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews. This acquisition provides ExxonMobil access to 6 additional licenses in Papua New Guinea, totaling about 4 million acres. Elk Antelope complements our existing discovered, undeveloped resources, such as Penn Yan, better positioning the co-ventures to expand the existing operation with additional LNG trains. The transaction will allow ExxonMobil to create unique value for shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea, and we look forward to working closely with co-ventures, the government, customers, and importantly, local communities to grow the successful business.
Moving now to Slide 18 for an update on Upstream projects and exploration activities where we're advancing several attractive new investment opportunities. ExxonMobil is on track to achieve 10 major project startups in 2016 and 2017, of which 4 have already initiated production. 
As shown on the photo, excellent progress continues at Hebron, located offshore Eastern Canada. The utilities and process module fabrication is now complete, and it was successfully loaded out in June from the fabrication yard in Korea for transport to Newfoundland and Labrador where it will then be installed on the gravity-based structure. Hebron remains on track for a late-2017 startup.
In Abu Dhabi, production is steadily increasing in the Upper Zakum field. Eight drilling rigs are operating on the artificial islands, where gross production has reached 100,000 barrels per day. Aggregate Upper Zakum gross production is currently about 670,000 barrels per day, and production is anticipated to reach 750,000 barrels per day by 2018.
ExxonMobil also recently sanctioned the Tengiz expansion project, which is expected to increase crude oil production capacity by up to 300,000 barrels per day, with startup in 2022. ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder in Tengizchevroil, the operator of the field.
Now offshore Guyana, we completed drilling operations on the Liza-2 appraisal well. The well test confirmed a world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource estimate of 800 million to 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The test also confirmed high-quality oil from the same  high-porosity sandstone reservoirs we saw in the Liza-1 discovery well.
ExxonMobil, along with its partners, is progressing development, planning activities on an early production concept, involving a floating production, storage and offloading facility, along with related subsea production systems. The final investment decision will be based on a variety of factors, including further Liza appraisal drilling, regulatory approvals and market conditions.
On July 17, we began drilling the Skipjack prospect, which is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza-1 discovery well. This is the third well on the Stabroek block.
In addition to these activities, ExxonMobil recently entered into an agreement with the ratio [ph] companies to acquire a 50%-ish interest in the Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana, and will become the operator. Kaieteur is approximately 250 kilometers offshore Guyana in ultra-deepwater north and adjacent to the Stabroek and Canje blocks. Pending government approval, this deal will bring our total acreage position in Guyana to 11.4 million acres over the 3 blocks.
Chart 19 showcases improvements in our U.S. unconventional operator portfolio. ExxonMobil is a leading operator in the U.S. unconventional production. Since 2013, we have more than tripled our gross operated production from the liquids-rich Permian and Bakken plays. Approximately 85% of this is liquids.
We have maintained a relentless focus on reducing cost and improving efficiency, while maintaining high operational integrity. We have continued to reduce drilling cost per foot, implement efficiencies and capture market savings to achieve substantial cost reductions. With longer, lateral lengths and improved completion designs, per well hydrocarbon recovery has dramatically improved. Coupled with lower drilling and completion costs, this higher recovery has resulted in a nearly 70% reduction in Permian unit development cost over the past 2 years. Our development cost per barrel is now $8 in the Permian and less than $10 in the Bakken.
Additionally, we have successfully reduced cash operating cost to approximately $8 per barrel. As a result of these cost improvements, a large part of the premium drill well -- Permian drill well inventory is economic at prices around $40 per barrel. Over 2,000 drillable locations in Permian and Bakken yield a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel. This drillable inventory equates to 9 years of continuous drilling at 2015 rig levels, providing ExxonMobil the flexibility to progress profitable, short-cycle opportunities and adjust activity in response to market conditions. And as you can see on the chart, our economic drill well inventory increases significantly as energy demand and prices improve.
Turning to Slide 20, and an update on our Downstream and Chemical businesses, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales. First, we recently completed the expansion of our Taicang lubricants plant. This facility employs innovative blending technologies that increase operating efficiency and enables us to support growing demand for premium lubricants in China.
In the Chemical business, we launched Exceed XP performance polymers, which expands our comprehensive slate of polyethylene products. This new product provides leading performance in a variety of film applications, including consumer, construction and agricultural use. Exceed XP was developed using advanced catalyst technology, process research and applications expertise. ExxonMobil recently announced a facility expansion of their Santoprene plant in the United Kingdom to meet growing demand for specialty elastomers for the automotive, consumer and industrial segments. 
Additionally, we announced a project at the Beaumont refinery to expand ultra-low sulfur, diesel and gasoline production by more than 40,000 barrels per day. The upgraded facilities will employ proprietary scan-finding [ph] technology to remove sulfur and maximize octane.
Corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We are evaluating a new project with SABIC to build a world-scale ethane cracker and derivative units along the U.S. Gulf Coast. SABIC and ExxonMobil enjoy a long history of successful partnership. 
Most recently, we completed a joint specialty elastomer's project at our Kenya facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility builds on existing world-scale commodity assets to help meet growing demand for premium synthetic rubbers.
Chart 21 illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10.5 billion funded shareholder distributions and together, with a moderate increases in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive advantage and the flexibility to selectively invest through the cycle. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2015.
Finally, ExxonMobil generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the first half of 2016, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. 
Moving to Slide 22. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil is delivering on its commitments and continues to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. At mid-year, the corporation has earned $3.5 billion and generated $10.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales amid volatile industry conditions, underscoring the resilience of our integrated business.
Upstream volumes were 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and capital spending has been reduced 36% to $10.3 billion. As you just heard, we continue to advance our investment plans to extend competitive advantage and unlock value across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses. And we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled $6.2 billion.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'd be happy to take your questions."

Now like any type of commodity, there are the big periods of oversupply and periods of shortness. And we do expect that through -- into the early part of the next decade that there will be some oversupply. But we keep focused on long-term value proposition. And I've always said, the energy outlook is one of providing us the insights and informing us for our investment choices. The Papua New Guinea, as I said in my prepared comments, has been just a remarkable outcome. The organization is really proud of the results, and we think we've got a really strong business there. And frankly, I think a brownfield expansion of the existing facility is going to compete very strongly for additional LNG demand in the future. I think we're very well positioned with the experience that we've got in country, the relationship that we have with the communities and with the government, our marketing capability. So I think the organization sees that as a very significant opportunity moving forward. Broadly speaking, as you've heard, we've got a number of LNG projects that are in our development planning stages that we think are going to compete for that long-term LNG demand growth."

If you think about the recent period, there's been a -- to be very transparent, we've had a much stronger focus on development of liquids opportunities, less so on gas. Longer term, we think about that gas resource base in a number of ways. One, as I said earlier, we expect gas to grow globally at 1.6% per year, so we expect in the U.S. is that gas will underpin the increases in domestic use. And you've seen how gas has continued to grow in power generation, as an example. Two, we see that gas helping to underpin some of these petrochemical investments that we've been talking about, like the investment we've got in Baytown and even the one we're considering with SABIC. And then three, that gas also underpins our ability to compete in the global LNG market and our anticipated increases in demand."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our cash flow reflects the durability of the integrated portfolio amid industry volatility. In particular, strong Chemical results highlight sustainable competitive advantages, including gas and liquids-cracking capabilities, along with our differentiated product portfolio. Our financial flexibility enables us to selectively advance new investment opportunities across the value chain, and I'll provide an update on several of these new investments later in the presentation. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic conditions were mixed in the second quarter. U.S. growth recovered modestly relative to the weak first quarter, and China showed signs of stabilization. However, Europe and Japan experienced slower growth. Crude oil prices increased, whereas average global natural gas prices decreased sequentially. Global refining margins benefited from improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. However, Chemical product margins weakened due to higher feed and energy costs. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $5.2 billion, down 38% from the second quarter of last year, reflecting both prudent capital management and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $44.5 billion.
The next slide provides additional details on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.8 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.3 billion. 
Moving now on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings decreased $2.5 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs in the quarter were in line with our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years.
In the sequential quarter comparison showed on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $110 million, as stronger Upstream results partly offset lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate charges.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Second quarter Upstream earnings were $294 million, down $1.7 billion from a year-ago quarter. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion. Crude prices declined by over $16 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $50 million, and all other items added another $450 million, reflecting reduced operating expenses, the absence of an unfavorable onetime impact from the Alberta tax increase and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production was comparable to the second quarter of last year at about 4 million barrels per day. Liquids production was up 39,000 barrels per day, whereas growth from recent project startups was partly offset by the impact of fuel decline, downtime events, notably in Nigeria and in Canada with the wildfires in Alberta. Natural gas production, however, decreased 366 million cubic feet per day, including fuel decline, downtime and divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $370 million higher than the first quarter. Realizations improved earnings by $960 million. Crude increased nearly $12.50 per barrel. However, gas realizations decreased by over $0.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and sales mix effects, including lower seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher downtime reduced earnings by $280 million. All other items further decreased earnings by $310 million, including higher exploration expenses, lower gains from asset sales and less favorable tax items.
Moving now to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 368,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.5%. Liquid production decreased 208,000 barrels per day, mostly from downtime events and entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 962 million cubic feet per day on seasonally lower European demand.
So moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $825 million, a decrease of $681 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $850 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from improved U.S. reliability and lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $40 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $81 million. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $80 million, while favorable marketing volumes added $20 million. Other items reduced earnings $180 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance costs.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Second quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from both gas and liquids cracking contributed $150 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $70 million, while all other items reduced earnings $250 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains.
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased $138 million due to weaker margins and increased maintenance activity. 
Next several charts will provide an update on how the corporation's advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage. Chart 17 showcases a good opportunity to add quality resources to our successful LNG operation in Papua New Guinea. ExxonMobil has a long and successful history in the global LNG business and is proud to have started up the Papua New Guinea LNG project ahead of schedule, given its many complexities. In 2015, PNG LNG produced 7.4 million tons per annum, exceeding the original design capacity of 6.9 million tons by 7%.
We continue to safely increase plant throughput and improve reliability at low cost. And in this regard, in June, we achieved an annualized rate of 8.2 million tons per annum, the highest monthly rate since startup.
Built on this success, ExxonMobil recently announced plans to acquire Interoil Corporation in a transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, which includes consideration of $45 per share to be paid in ExxonMobil's stock. The agreement also includes a contingent payment, which is based on the resource certification of the discovered, undeveloped Elk Antelope field and is payable about 6.2 trillion cubic feet up to a maximum of 10 trillion cubic feet.
Finally, the agreement is subject to Interoil's shareholder approval and the other customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews. This acquisition provides ExxonMobil access to 6 additional licenses in Papua New Guinea, totaling about 4 million acres. Elk Antelope complements our existing discovered, undeveloped resources, such as Penn Yan, better positioning the co-ventures to expand the existing operation with additional LNG trains. The transaction will allow ExxonMobil to create unique value for shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea, and we look forward to working closely with co-ventures, the government, customers, and importantly, local communities to grow the successful business.
Moving now to Slide 18 for an update on Upstream projects and exploration activities where we're advancing several attractive new investment opportunities. ExxonMobil is on track to achieve 10 major project startups in 2016 and 2017, of which 4 have already initiated production. 
As shown on the photo, excellent progress continues at Hebron, located offshore Eastern Canada. The utilities and process module fabrication is now complete, and it was successfully loaded out in June from the fabrication yard in Korea for transport to Newfoundland and Labrador where it will then be installed on the gravity-based structure. Hebron remains on track for a late-2017 startup.
In Abu Dhabi, production is steadily increasing in the Upper Zakum field. Eight drilling rigs are operating on the artificial islands, where gross production has reached 100,000 barrels per day. Aggregate Upper Zakum gross production is currently about 670,000 barrels per day, and production is anticipated to reach 750,000 barrels per day by 2018.
ExxonMobil also recently sanctioned the Tengiz expansion project, which is expected to increase crude oil production capacity by up to 300,000 barrels per day, with startup in 2022. ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder in Tengizchevroil, the operator of the field.
Now offshore Guyana, we completed drilling operations on the Liza-2 appraisal well. The well test confirmed a world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource estimate of 800 million to 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The test also confirmed high-quality oil from the same  high-porosity sandstone reservoirs we saw in the Liza-1 discovery well.
ExxonMobil, along with its partners, is progressing development, planning activities on an early production concept, involving a floating production, storage and offloading facility, along with related subsea production systems. The final investment decision will be based on a variety of factors, including further Liza appraisal drilling, regulatory approvals and market conditions.
On July 17, we began drilling the Skipjack prospect, which is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza-1 discovery well. This is the third well on the Stabroek block.
In addition to these activities, ExxonMobil recently entered into an agreement with the ratio [ph] companies to acquire a 50%-ish interest in the Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana, and will become the operator. Kaieteur is approximately 250 kilometers offshore Guyana in ultra-deepwater north and adjacent to the Stabroek and Canje blocks. Pending government approval, this deal will bring our total acreage position in Guyana to 11.4 million acres over the 3 blocks.
Chart 19 showcases improvements in our U.S. unconventional operator portfolio. ExxonMobil is a leading operator in the U.S. unconventional production. Since 2013, we have more than tripled our gross operated production from the liquids-rich Permian and Bakken plays. Approximately 85% of this is liquids.
We have maintained a relentless focus on reducing cost and improving efficiency, while maintaining high operational integrity. We have continued to reduce drilling cost per foot, implement efficiencies and capture market savings to achieve substantial cost reductions. With longer, lateral lengths and improved completion designs, per well hydrocarbon recovery has dramatically improved. Coupled with lower drilling and completion costs, this higher recovery has resulted in a nearly 70% reduction in Permian unit development cost over the past 2 years. Our development cost per barrel is now $8 in the Permian and less than $10 in the Bakken.
Additionally, we have successfully reduced cash operating cost to approximately $8 per barrel. As a result of these cost improvements, a large part of the premium drill well -- Permian drill well inventory is economic at prices around $40 per barrel. Over 2,000 drillable locations in Permian and Bakken yield a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel. This drillable inventory equates to 9 years of continuous drilling at 2015 rig levels, providing ExxonMobil the flexibility to progress profitable, short-cycle opportunities and adjust activity in response to market conditions. And as you can see on the chart, our economic drill well inventory increases significantly as energy demand and prices improve.
Turning to Slide 20, and an update on our Downstream and Chemical businesses, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales. First, we recently completed the expansion of our Taicang lubricants plant. This facility employs innovative blending technologies that increase operating efficiency and enables us to support growing demand for premium lubricants in China.
In the Chemical business, we launched Exceed XP performance polymers, which expands our comprehensive slate of polyethylene products. This new product provides leading performance in a variety of film applications, including consumer, construction and agricultural use. Exceed XP was developed using advanced catalyst technology, process research and applications expertise. ExxonMobil recently announced a facility expansion of their Santoprene plant in the United Kingdom to meet growing demand for specialty elastomers for the automotive, consumer and industrial segments. 
Additionally, we announced a project at the Beaumont refinery to expand ultra-low sulfur, diesel and gasoline production by more than 40,000 barrels per day. The upgraded facilities will employ proprietary scan-finding [ph] technology to remove sulfur and maximize octane.
Corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We are evaluating a new project with SABIC to build a world-scale ethane cracker and derivative units along the U.S. Gulf Coast. SABIC and ExxonMobil enjoy a long history of successful partnership. 
Most recently, we completed a joint specialty elastomer's project at our Kenya facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility builds on existing world-scale commodity assets to help meet growing demand for premium synthetic rubbers.
Chart 21 illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10.5 billion funded shareholder distributions and together, with a moderate increases in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive advantage and the flexibility to selectively invest through the cycle. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2015.
Finally, ExxonMobil generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the first half of 2016, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. 
Moving to Slide 22. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil is delivering on its commitments and continues to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. At mid-year, the corporation has earned $3.5 billion and generated $10.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales amid volatile industry conditions, underscoring the resilience of our integrated business.
Upstream volumes were 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and capital spending has been reduced 36% to $10.3 billion. As you just heard, we continue to advance our investment plans to extend competitive advantage and unlock value across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses. And we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled $6.2 billion.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'd be happy to take your questions."

And I've always said, the energy outlook is one of providing us the insights and informing us for our investment choices. The Papua New Guinea, as I said in my prepared comments, has been just a remarkable outcome. The organization is really proud of the results, and we think we've got a really strong business there. And frankly, I think a brownfield expansion of the existing facility is going to compete very strongly for additional LNG demand in the future. I think we're very well positioned with the experience that we've got in country, the relationship that we have with the communities and with the government, our marketing capability. So I think the organization sees that as a very significant opportunity moving forward.

We're not seeing major budget overruns or extension to the schedules, and that's an important deliverable. And then there are still opportunities to go ahead and delay some of our resource investments that in this down market we can restructure them to capture additional value.

But Nigeria, you may recall that we did declare a force majeure in May for a period of time, and that resulted from a third-party operator that had a operational instance while they were towing a drill rig that unfortunately sat down on one of our pipelines. So we had to shut in the facility to help them remove that rig and then investigate the impact. More recently here in July, we had another force majeure. We picked up a system anomaly on the offshore export pipeline and have had some initial investigation. And we believe it was damaged due to a third-party impact.

So once again, our outlook will inform our business strategy and our investment choices, and we see this as a really good opportunity. Remember that we've currently got a project underway in Baytown to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity in a corresponding project at Mount Bellevue to add derivative units taking to polyethylene. In fact, metallocene polyethylene. This project would look at another world-scale cracker of about 1.8 million tons per year of ethylene and then would feed, at this stage, still early, would feed mono ethylene glycol plant and 2 polyethylene plants."

Longer term, we think about that gas resource base in a number of ways. One, as I said earlier, we expect gas to grow globally at 1.6% per year, so we expect in the U.S. is that gas will underpin the increases in domestic use. And you've seen how gas has continued to grow in power generation, as an example. Two, we see that gas helping to underpin some of these petrochemical investments that we've been talking about, like the investment we've got in Baytown and even the one we're considering with SABIC. And then three, that gas also underpins our ability to compete in the global LNG market and our anticipated increases in demand."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our cash flow reflects the durability of the integrated portfolio amid industry volatility. In particular, strong Chemical results highlight sustainable competitive advantages, including gas and liquids-cracking capabilities, along with our differentiated product portfolio. Our financial flexibility enables us to selectively advance new investment opportunities across the value chain, and I'll provide an update on several of these new investments later in the presentation. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic conditions were mixed in the second quarter. U.S. growth recovered modestly relative to the weak first quarter, and China showed signs of stabilization. However, Europe and Japan experienced slower growth. Crude oil prices increased, whereas average global natural gas prices decreased sequentially. Global refining margins benefited from improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. However, Chemical product margins weakened due to higher feed and energy costs. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $5.2 billion, down 38% from the second quarter of last year, reflecting both prudent capital management and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $44.5 billion.
The next slide provides additional details on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.8 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.3 billion. 
Moving now on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings decreased $2.5 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs in the quarter were in line with our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years.
In the sequential quarter comparison showed on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $110 million, as stronger Upstream results partly offset lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate charges.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Second quarter Upstream earnings were $294 million, down $1.7 billion from a year-ago quarter. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion. Crude prices declined by over $16 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $50 million, and all other items added another $450 million, reflecting reduced operating expenses, the absence of an unfavorable onetime impact from the Alberta tax increase and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production was comparable to the second quarter of last year at about 4 million barrels per day. Liquids production was up 39,000 barrels per day, whereas growth from recent project startups was partly offset by the impact of fuel decline, downtime events, notably in Nigeria and in Canada with the wildfires in Alberta. Natural gas production, however, decreased 366 million cubic feet per day, including fuel decline, downtime and divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $370 million higher than the first quarter. Realizations improved earnings by $960 million. Crude increased nearly $12.50 per barrel. However, gas realizations decreased by over $0.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and sales mix effects, including lower seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher downtime reduced earnings by $280 million. All other items further decreased earnings by $310 million, including higher exploration expenses, lower gains from asset sales and less favorable tax items.
Moving now to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 368,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or 8.5%. Liquid production decreased 208,000 barrels per day, mostly from downtime events and entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 962 million cubic feet per day on seasonally lower European demand.
So moving now to the Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $825 million, a decrease of $681 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $850 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from improved U.S. reliability and lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $40 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $81 million. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $80 million, while favorable marketing volumes added $20 million. Other items reduced earnings $180 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance costs.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Second quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from both gas and liquids cracking contributed $150 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $70 million, while all other items reduced earnings $250 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains.
Moving to Slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased $138 million due to weaker margins and increased maintenance activity. 
Next several charts will provide an update on how the corporation's advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage. Chart 17 showcases a good opportunity to add quality resources to our successful LNG operation in Papua New Guinea. ExxonMobil has a long and successful history in the global LNG business and is proud to have started up the Papua New Guinea LNG project ahead of schedule, given its many complexities. In 2015, PNG LNG produced 7.4 million tons per annum, exceeding the original design capacity of 6.9 million tons by 7%.
We continue to safely increase plant throughput and improve reliability at low cost. And in this regard, in June, we achieved an annualized rate of 8.2 million tons per annum, the highest monthly rate since startup.
Built on this success, ExxonMobil recently announced plans to acquire Interoil Corporation in a transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, which includes consideration of $45 per share to be paid in ExxonMobil's stock. The agreement also includes a contingent payment, which is based on the resource certification of the discovered, undeveloped Elk Antelope field and is payable about 6.2 trillion cubic feet up to a maximum of 10 trillion cubic feet.
Finally, the agreement is subject to Interoil's shareholder approval and the other customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews. This acquisition provides ExxonMobil access to 6 additional licenses in Papua New Guinea, totaling about 4 million acres. Elk Antelope complements our existing discovered, undeveloped resources, such as Penn Yan, better positioning the co-ventures to expand the existing operation with additional LNG trains. The transaction will allow ExxonMobil to create unique value for shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea, and we look forward to working closely with co-ventures, the government, customers, and importantly, local communities to grow the successful business.
Moving now to Slide 18 for an update on Upstream projects and exploration activities where we're advancing several attractive new investment opportunities. ExxonMobil is on track to achieve 10 major project startups in 2016 and 2017, of which 4 have already initiated production. 
As shown on the photo, excellent progress continues at Hebron, located offshore Eastern Canada. The utilities and process module fabrication is now complete, and it was successfully loaded out in June from the fabrication yard in Korea for transport to Newfoundland and Labrador where it will then be installed on the gravity-based structure. Hebron remains on track for a late-2017 startup.
In Abu Dhabi, production is steadily increasing in the Upper Zakum field. Eight drilling rigs are operating on the artificial islands, where gross production has reached 100,000 barrels per day. Aggregate Upper Zakum gross production is currently about 670,000 barrels per day, and production is anticipated to reach 750,000 barrels per day by 2018.
ExxonMobil also recently sanctioned the Tengiz expansion project, which is expected to increase crude oil production capacity by up to 300,000 barrels per day, with startup in 2022. ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder in Tengizchevroil, the operator of the field.
Now offshore Guyana, we completed drilling operations on the Liza-2 appraisal well. The well test confirmed a world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource estimate of 800 million to 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The test also confirmed high-quality oil from the same  high-porosity sandstone reservoirs we saw in the Liza-1 discovery well.
ExxonMobil, along with its partners, is progressing development, planning activities on an early production concept, involving a floating production, storage and offloading facility, along with related subsea production systems. The final investment decision will be based on a variety of factors, including further Liza appraisal drilling, regulatory approvals and market conditions.
On July 17, we began drilling the Skipjack prospect, which is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza-1 discovery well. This is the third well on the Stabroek block.
In addition to these activities, ExxonMobil recently entered into an agreement with the ratio [ph] companies to acquire a 50%-ish interest in the Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana, and will become the operator. Kaieteur is approximately 250 kilometers offshore Guyana in ultra-deepwater north and adjacent to the Stabroek and Canje blocks. Pending government approval, this deal will bring our total acreage position in Guyana to 11.4 million acres over the 3 blocks.
Chart 19 showcases improvements in our U.S. unconventional operator portfolio. ExxonMobil is a leading operator in the U.S. unconventional production. Since 2013, we have more than tripled our gross operated production from the liquids-rich Permian and Bakken plays. Approximately 85% of this is liquids.
We have maintained a relentless focus on reducing cost and improving efficiency, while maintaining high operational integrity. We have continued to reduce drilling cost per foot, implement efficiencies and capture market savings to achieve substantial cost reductions. With longer, lateral lengths and improved completion designs, per well hydrocarbon recovery has dramatically improved. Coupled with lower drilling and completion costs, this higher recovery has resulted in a nearly 70% reduction in Permian unit development cost over the past 2 years. Our development cost per barrel is now $8 in the Permian and less than $10 in the Bakken.
Additionally, we have successfully reduced cash operating cost to approximately $8 per barrel. As a result of these cost improvements, a large part of the premium drill well -- Permian drill well inventory is economic at prices around $40 per barrel. Over 2,000 drillable locations in Permian and Bakken yield a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel. This drillable inventory equates to 9 years of continuous drilling at 2015 rig levels, providing ExxonMobil the flexibility to progress profitable, short-cycle opportunities and adjust activity in response to market conditions. And as you can see on the chart, our economic drill well inventory increases significantly as energy demand and prices improve.
Turning to Slide 20, and an update on our Downstream and Chemical businesses, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales. First, we recently completed the expansion of our Taicang lubricants plant. This facility employs innovative blending technologies that increase operating efficiency and enables us to support growing demand for premium lubricants in China.
In the Chemical business, we launched Exceed XP performance polymers, which expands our comprehensive slate of polyethylene products. This new product provides leading performance in a variety of film applications, including consumer, construction and agricultural use. Exceed XP was developed using advanced catalyst technology, process research and applications expertise. ExxonMobil recently announced a facility expansion of their Santoprene plant in the United Kingdom to meet growing demand for specialty elastomers for the automotive, consumer and industrial segments. 
Additionally, we announced a project at the Beaumont refinery to expand ultra-low sulfur, diesel and gasoline production by more than 40,000 barrels per day. The upgraded facilities will employ proprietary scan-finding [ph] technology to remove sulfur and maximize octane.
Corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We are evaluating a new project with SABIC to build a world-scale ethane cracker and derivative units along the U.S. Gulf Coast. SABIC and ExxonMobil enjoy a long history of successful partnership. 
Most recently, we completed a joint specialty elastomer's project at our Kenya facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility builds on existing world-scale commodity assets to help meet growing demand for premium synthetic rubbers.
Chart 21 illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10.5 billion funded shareholder distributions and together, with a moderate increases in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive advantage and the flexibility to selectively invest through the cycle. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2015.
Finally, ExxonMobil generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the first half of 2016, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. 
Moving to Slide 22. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil is delivering on its commitments and continues to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. At mid-year, the corporation has earned $3.5 billion and generated $10.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales amid volatile industry conditions, underscoring the resilience of our integrated business.
Upstream volumes were 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and capital spending has been reduced 36% to $10.3 billion. As you just heard, we continue to advance our investment plans to extend competitive advantage and unlock value across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses. And we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled $6.2 billion.
That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'd be happy to take your questions."

Now like any type of commodity, there are the big periods of oversupply and periods of shortness. And we do expect that through -- into the early part of the next decade that there will be some oversupply. But we keep focused on long-term value proposition. And I've always said, the energy outlook is one of providing us the insights and informing us for our investment choices. The Papua New Guinea, as I said in my prepared comments, has been just a remarkable outcome. The organization is really proud of the results, and we think we've got a really strong business there. And frankly, I think a brownfield expansion of the existing facility is going to compete very strongly for additional LNG demand in the future. I think we're very well positioned with the experience that we've got in country, the relationship that we have with the communities and with the government, our marketing capability.

So we had to shut in the facility to help them remove that rig and then investigate the impact. More recently here in July, we had another force majeure.

So once again, our outlook will inform our business strategy and our investment choices, and we see this as a really good opportunity.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. Corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite a challenging business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemical segments. ExxonMobil's diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct competitive advantage through the business cycle. 
We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals. While we continue to capture market savings in the current environment, we also remain resolute in our drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment. Finally, as I'll share with you today, the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments. We are effectively progressing selective, strategic investments while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safe, reliable operations. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw modest global economic growth in the third quarter. While the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth rates slowed in China and remained soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat, although volatile, whereas natural gas prices strengthened on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as production continued to outpace demand, and chemical commodity product margins remained strong, while specialty margins held relatively flat. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $0.63 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion, down 45% from the third quarter last year, reflecting the corporation's capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.3 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.1 billion and debt was $46.2 billion. 
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Total quarter cash balances increased from $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash, including shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.7 billion.
Moving now to Slide 7 to review our segmented results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were approximately flat to the prior year quarter, although below our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. 
In a sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $950 million on stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $620 million, down $738 million from a year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations, which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.13 per 1,000 cubic feet. [indiscernible] and sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million, and all other items added $60 million, driven by lower operating expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, totaling just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 120,000 barrels per day as growth from projects and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due to third-party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day as new project volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per barrel, and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefiting from reduced operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 146,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or almost 4%. Liquids production dropped 119,000 barrels per day from downtime events, entitlement impacts and field decline. Natural gas production decreased 161 million cubic feet per day as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from U.S. work programs. 
Moving now to Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170 million. Other items, including lower operating costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains increased earnings by $580 million. As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. To date, more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model, resulting in an earnings impact of $380 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity, increased earnings by $240 million. All other items added a further $490 million, mostly from asset management gains and lower expenses. 
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $56 million from the prior year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings decreased $46 million sequentially, where stronger margins partly offset increased maintenance activity. 
Moving now to Slide 17. Key to delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating costs down, especially in the current business climate, with year-to-date CapEx and operating costs lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior year period. We strive to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total life cycle costs. 
With our global procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement with the service sector on developing and implementing lower-cost solutions. 
Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design and execution phases that capture these structural advantages, while ensuring high integrity in our operations. For example, by leveraging our Fast Drill Process and flat time reduction initiatives, we realized cumulative drilling savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved performance in places like Angola, Guyana and Russia. A hallmark of our success has been our committed focus across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower-cost alternatives, but also to enhance integrity and reliability, improve productivity, increase product value and minimize environmental impact. 
On Slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of proved reserves and asset impairments. Our results are in accordance with the rules and standards of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves. As I indicated, our reporting is consistent with the SEC rules, which prescribe technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical 12-month average of ""first day of the month"" prices in a given year. As such, the low-price environment impacted our 2015 reserves replacement, resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas reserves being reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels, primarily in the U.S., reflecting the change in natural gas prices, offset by liquid additions of 1.9 billion barrels. 
Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on the SEC pricing basis, we anticipate that certain quantities of currently booked reserves, such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands, will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with ""end of field life"" production for certain other liquids and natural gas operations in North America also may not qualify. 
However, as you know, amounts required to be de-booked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked in the future when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the de-booking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect the operation of these assets or to alter our outlook for future production volumes. And you can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K. 
Now regarding asset impairments. We follow U.S. GAAP, successful efforts. And under this standard, assessments are made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. This is different than the SEC price basis for reserves that I just described. 
As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year, we undertook an effort to assess our major long-life assets most at risk for potential impact. The price basis used in this assessment was generally consistent with long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that the future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value. Again, this is detailed in our 2015 10-K. 
In light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-life assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our year-end financial statements.  
Moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on efforts to further enhance our development portfolio and advance major projects. First in Guyana, the Liza-3 appraisal well was successfully completed in October, increasing our confidence in the area of extent of this world-class resource. Well results now confirm the Liza discovery to be in excess of 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels. These results are being incorporated into early engineering plans for the initial phase of 100,000-barrel per day development. The Stena Carron drillship will next move to the priority [ph] exploration prospect located approximately 10 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 discovery. Payar [ph] is expected to be completed late this year or early next year. After which, the rig will move to another exploration opportunity, also on the Stabroek block. 
In West Africa, the Owowo-3 [ph] well located approximately 56 miles offshore Angola, reached target depth in October and discovered significant oil resources. This well builds on our successful Owowo-2 [ph] well drilled in 2012 on the neighboring license. Together, these wells confirm a 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrel oil discovery. 
ExxonMobil continues to invest in its exploration activity to grow our prospect inventory across the globe. Recognizing the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing countercyclically in large-scale seismic acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data, covering diverse geological basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Ireland, South Africa and Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advanced seismic imaging and high-performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data. 
In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large-scale developments. The Kashegan project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable restart of production in October. Work is ongoing to safely and gradually increase production to a target level of 370,000 barrels per day over the next year. 
In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped 4 LNG cargoes from since August, and a second LNG train has now started up. In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron Utilities and Process Module, or UPM, was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The topsides, including UPM, will next be mated with the concrete gravity base structure shown on the background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to start up by year-end 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. This slide illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions, and together with a moderate increase in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through this cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities. 
ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015. 
Moving now to Slide 21. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through this cycle. Year-to-date, corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated $16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, benefiting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we anticipate that full year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million barrels per day driven by our value-based choices. 
ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline regardless of the business environment. Year-to-date capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend distributions totaled $9.3 billion. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

I mean, when you think about a 10-year average demand growth of somewhere between 1 to 1.1 million barrels per day since 2014, we're seeing demand growth in excess of that. So fairly reasonable demand growth in the recent past. If you look -- focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in oversupply situation, with the production exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, it's -- we are seeing convergence in the second half. But I'll tell you that as you continue to progress that, we'll probably end up this year oversupplied by anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million to 1 million barrels per day of supply. Now of course, all this is going into commercial inventories. So as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see convergence, maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But I'd caution that we got to recognize that there's still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial inventory build since the end of 2013. That's got to come out of inventory at some point. And then, of course, there's still uncertainties in the supply trend. Some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. unconventionals will have an influence on the supply-demand balance. So I think when you heard Rex's comments, he was reflecting on all these factors as to how that will impact price in the near to medium term."

We're completing the Liza-3 well. As I indicated, we'll move on to an exploration well, which is to the northwest of the Liza discovery. We are integrating real time all of this well data. And of course, we took very extensive 3D seismic survey. And all that's being integrated into our development planning. So in short, I'd say we're very encouraged by, not only Liza, but the prospectivity on the block. And we see this as a high-quality asset for the corporation. Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I tell you that this is a continuation of initial discovery. The Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery, but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper objective. So again, very encouraging. As I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrels oil discovery. And we will clearly integrate to -- that into our development planning. I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization and its integration is able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development there. So I think it's a great example about the value [indiscernible] bring from the general interest integration of the corporation."

But at the same time, we're also very alert to where there may be some value propositions from acquisitions. And I think the Interoil transaction is a really good example. We discovered a substantial resource base [indiscernible]. We've continued our exploration activity, looking towards an expansion of the existing LNG facility. And in addition to that, we saw the opportunity for synergies, value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically, the Elk-Antelope resource that we could combine with our existing resources there.

And from an ethylene perspective, we're expecting that Chemical demand will grow such that you add -- need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new capacity per year. And to put that into hardware, that would be 3 to 4 world-scale crackers per year. So that really is -- that sets up the value proposition. First, as you know, we're expanding the Baytown complex to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity. A corresponding investment at Mt. Belvieu, adding a derivative units to produce ExxonMobil's high-value metallocene polyethylene. And then we announced -- to your question, we announced potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker to produce ethylene about 1.8 million tons per annum. And a corresponding derivative units at -- that would be built alongside that.

Nothing's really slowed down in that regard and how we're working through the maximizing the value proposition for those investments. And as I've said earlier, we're trying to take full advantage of the cycle benefits. On the short-cycle side, you may recall, and I think the number you're picking up with is in our unconventional program we shared in March that we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture higher -- a higher price environment in our unconventional program. But to the order of magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So we've got a lot of flexibility in our short-cycle program. And when you think about what really sets the balance between short- and long-cycle investment. And the way I think about it, from a short-cycle perspective, Doug, it's really maintaining a program in a low price environment that allows us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits. You don't want to go much beyond that because you're trying also maximize value. So I think we're very well positioned.

But you can see some pretty good detail of what we go through and in fact, maybe you've already looked at given your comments in our 10-K. That really defines the process pretty clearly. But I really don't have any market share on the specifics of the mechanics that we go through.

But recognize that a large part of our Asian gas coming from Cutter and Papua New Guinea is under long-term contracts. And a good part of them are liquids linked. So that's about all I can give you on that. In terms of the markets, clearly, Asia Pacific market is an important market for LNG. We've got a very expensive marketing organization and go had identify value opportunities. We are primarily interested in locking in long-term contracts, either point-to-point or a portfolio sale. You may recall that before we take a project to an LNG project to final investment decision that we will lock in a majority of those volumes on a long-term contract. We've been really develop a very strong reputation and credibility with the buyers to our ability to deliver these projects on schedule. And our responsiveness to managing through the contract terms, we've got a new operations center that we put in place in Asia Pacific to facilitate the transactions with our many buyers."

As you know, let me just first talk about capital allocation. It's one of -- from our cash flow from operations, the first thing the corporation wants to do is go ahead and pay a reliable and growing dividend. The next thing is the remaining cash is put towards to a investment program that has got to the point where we believe that we have maximized the value proposition for investments. If we've got enough cash to go ahead and invest it to fund that investment program, then the remaining cash will either be put forward to either stock buyback -- share buybacks or paying down our debt. If we don't have enough cash, you've seen us do in the recent past, we'll go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional debt. Because the service costs associated with that debt is more than benefited by the return we get from these investments. So it's important to recognize that while we are very mindful of prudently managing our cash, we also believe it's very important for us to continue to invest through the cycle. And we do that in a very measured way that we're not leaving any value on the table. And that's therefore my comments I made earlier about making sure that we're optimizing value in the bottom of the cycle."

The last thing I'd mention is the application of technology has been fundamental, absolutely fundamental to our past success and into the future. When you think about where you're getting those benefits across the full value chain, I mean, from the Downstream, our Chemical business where we use proprietary technology to provide high-value metallocene to our unconventional business with the fracking technology. So the application and the growth of these technology solutions have been a key element. And sometimes, some of these projects are really waiting on some of the technology work that's underway.

And it causes us to pace those investments out on a longer cycle in order to make sure that we're fully capturing the value. On the short-cycle investments, as I alluded to earlier, we want to keep activity levels in the down cycle commensurate with the learning curve benefits that we've been realizing such that we are enhancing value across the full portfolio, but it then makes sense to do much more beyond that if you recognize that you want to optimize value.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. Corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite a challenging business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemical segments. ExxonMobil's diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct competitive advantage through the business cycle. 
We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals. While we continue to capture market savings in the current environment, we also remain resolute in our drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment. Finally, as I'll share with you today, the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments. We are effectively progressing selective, strategic investments while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safe, reliable operations. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw modest global economic growth in the third quarter. While the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth rates slowed in China and remained soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat, although volatile, whereas natural gas prices strengthened on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as production continued to outpace demand, and chemical commodity product margins remained strong, while specialty margins held relatively flat. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $0.63 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion, down 45% from the third quarter last year, reflecting the corporation's capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.3 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.1 billion and debt was $46.2 billion. 
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Total quarter cash balances increased from $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash, including shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.7 billion.
Moving now to Slide 7 to review our segmented results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were approximately flat to the prior year quarter, although below our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. 
In a sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $950 million on stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $620 million, down $738 million from a year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations, which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.13 per 1,000 cubic feet. [indiscernible] and sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million, and all other items added $60 million, driven by lower operating expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, totaling just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 120,000 barrels per day as growth from projects and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due to third-party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day as new project volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per barrel, and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefiting from reduced operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 146,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or almost 4%. Liquids production dropped 119,000 barrels per day from downtime events, entitlement impacts and field decline. Natural gas production decreased 161 million cubic feet per day as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from U.S. work programs. 
Moving now to Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170 million. Other items, including lower operating costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains increased earnings by $580 million. As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. To date, more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model, resulting in an earnings impact of $380 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity, increased earnings by $240 million. All other items added a further $490 million, mostly from asset management gains and lower expenses. 
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $56 million from the prior year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings decreased $46 million sequentially, where stronger margins partly offset increased maintenance activity. 
Moving now to Slide 17. Key to delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating costs down, especially in the current business climate, with year-to-date CapEx and operating costs lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior year period. We strive to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total life cycle costs. 
With our global procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement with the service sector on developing and implementing lower-cost solutions. 
Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design and execution phases that capture these structural advantages, while ensuring high integrity in our operations. For example, by leveraging our Fast Drill Process and flat time reduction initiatives, we realized cumulative drilling savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved performance in places like Angola, Guyana and Russia. A hallmark of our success has been our committed focus across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower-cost alternatives, but also to enhance integrity and reliability, improve productivity, increase product value and minimize environmental impact. 
On Slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of proved reserves and asset impairments. Our results are in accordance with the rules and standards of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves. As I indicated, our reporting is consistent with the SEC rules, which prescribe technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical 12-month average of ""first day of the month"" prices in a given year. As such, the low-price environment impacted our 2015 reserves replacement, resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas reserves being reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels, primarily in the U.S., reflecting the change in natural gas prices, offset by liquid additions of 1.9 billion barrels. 
Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on the SEC pricing basis, we anticipate that certain quantities of currently booked reserves, such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands, will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with ""end of field life"" production for certain other liquids and natural gas operations in North America also may not qualify. 
However, as you know, amounts required to be de-booked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked in the future when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the de-booking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect the operation of these assets or to alter our outlook for future production volumes. And you can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K. 
Now regarding asset impairments. We follow U.S. GAAP, successful efforts. And under this standard, assessments are made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. This is different than the SEC price basis for reserves that I just described. 
As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year, we undertook an effort to assess our major long-life assets most at risk for potential impact. The price basis used in this assessment was generally consistent with long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that the future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value. Again, this is detailed in our 2015 10-K. 
In light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-life assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our year-end financial statements.  
Moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on efforts to further enhance our development portfolio and advance major projects. First in Guyana, the Liza-3 appraisal well was successfully completed in October, increasing our confidence in the areal extent of this world-class resource. Well results now confirm the Liza discovery to be in excess of 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels. These results are being incorporated into early engineering plans for the initial phase of 100,000-barrel per day development. The Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Payara exploration prospect located approximately 10 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 discovery. Payara is expected to be completed late this year or early next year. After which, the rig will move to another exploration opportunity, also on the Stabroek block. 
In West Africa, the Owowo-3 well located approximately 56 miles offshore Angola, reached target depth in October and discovered significant oil resources. This well builds on our successful Owowo-2 well drilled in 2012 on the neighboring license. Together, these wells confirm a 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrel oil discovery. 
ExxonMobil continues to invest in its exploration activity to grow our prospect inventory across the globe. Recognizing the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing countercyclically in large-scale seismic acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data, covering diverse geological basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Ireland, South Africa and Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advanced seismic imaging and high-performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data. 
In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large-scale developments. The Kashegan project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable restart of production in October. Work is ongoing to safely and gradually increase production to a target level of 370,000 barrels per day over the next year. 
In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped 4 LNG cargoes from since August, and a second LNG train has now started up. In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron Utilities and Process Module, or UPM, was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The topsides, including UPM, will next be mated with the concrete gravity base structure shown on the background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to start up by year-end 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. This slide illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions, and together with a moderate increase in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through this cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities. 
ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015. 
Moving now to Slide 21. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through this cycle. Year-to-date, corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated $16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, benefiting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we anticipate that full year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million barrels per day driven by our value-based choices. 
ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline regardless of the business environment. Year-to-date capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend distributions totaled $9.3 billion. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

So Neil, if you think back and look at where we've been here in the recent past, I'll start with the demand. Demand has been generally reasonably strong. I mean, when you think about a 10-year average demand growth of somewhere between 1 to 1.1 million barrels per day since 2014, we're seeing demand growth in excess of that. So fairly reasonable demand growth in the recent past. If you look -- focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in oversupply situation, with the production exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, it's -- we are seeing convergence in the second half. But I'll tell you that as you continue to progress that, we'll probably end up this year oversupplied by anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million to 1 million barrels per day of supply. Now of course, all this is going into commercial inventories. So as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see convergence, maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But I'd caution that we got to recognize that there's still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial inventory build since the end of 2013. That's got to come out of inventory at some point. And then, of course, there's still uncertainties in the supply trend. Some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. unconventionals will have an influence on the supply-demand balance. So I think when you heard Rex's comments, he was reflecting on all these factors as to how that will impact price in the near to medium term."

So as I said in my prepared comments on Guyana, we were very pleased with the outcome of the Liza-3 well. The well is located just north of Liza-1. It has given us confidence in terms of the areal extent, the reservoir quality. And thus, our communication that we believe we're in excess of 1 billion barrels now. We're completing the Liza-3 well. As I indicated, we'll move on to an exploration well, which is to the northwest of the Liza discovery. We are integrating real time all of this well data. And of course, we took very extensive 3D seismic survey. And all that's being integrated into our development planning. So in short, I'd say we're very encouraged by, not only Liza, but the prospectivity on the block. And we see this as a high-quality asset for the corporation. Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I tell you that this is a continuation of an initial discovery. The Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery, but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper objective. So again, very encouraging. As I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrels oil discovery. And we will clearly integrate to -- that into our development planning. I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization in its integration is able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development there. So I think it's a great example about the value [indiscernible] bring from the general interest integration of the corporation."

The first was around the impact of the forward statement that you have and the comments that you made about the proved reserves.

But at the same time, we're also very alert to where there may be some value propositions from acquisitions. And I think the InterOil transaction is a really good example. We discovered a substantial resource base in Papua New Guinea. We've continued our exploration activity, looking towards an expansion of the existing LNG facility. And in addition to that, we saw the opportunity for synergies, value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically, the Elk-Antelope resource that we could combine with our existing resources there. And with the great success we've had in terms of the operating reliability and the cost structure there, I mean, it just is -- it puts right up to the top of the portfolio.

And from an ethylene perspective, we're expecting that chemical demand will grow such that you add -- need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new capacity per year. And to put that into hardware, that would be 3 to 4 world-scale crackers per year. So that really is -- that sets up the value proposition. First, as you know, we're expanding the Baytown complex to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity, a corresponding investment at Mont Belvieu, adding derivative units to produce ExxonMobil's high-value metallocene polyethylene. And then we announced -- to your question, we announced a potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker to produce ethylene of about 1.8 million tons per annum and a corresponding derivative units that would be built alongside that. But I think the value proposition is there. I think we're ahead of the game in terms of making some world-scale investments in this and a very strong component of our Chemical business."

Nothing's really slowed down in that regard in how we're working through the -- maximizing the value proposition for those investments. And as I've said earlier, we're trying to take full advantage of the cycle benefits. On the short-cycle side, you may recall -- and I think the number you're picking up with is in our unconventional program we shared in March that we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture higher -- a higher-price environment in our unconventional program to the order of magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So we've got a lot of flexibility in our short-cycle program. And then you think about what really sets the balance between short- and long-cycle investment. And the way I think about it, from a short-cycle perspective, Doug, it's really maintaining a program in a low-price environment that allows us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits. You don't want to go much beyond that because you're trying also maximize value. So I think we're very well positioned.

The first one had to do with a third-party rig that was transiting, that impacted our export line, which had an impact on our production. And that issue has been addressed, and the production is back on. The second one had to do with a third-party impact to the line. And let me just say that we're still investigating with the government. We do not believe it was accidental or due to mechanical failure."

So that's about all I can give you on that. In terms of the markets, clearly, the Asia Pacific market is an important market for LNG. We've got a very expansive marketing organization to go ahead and identify value opportunities. We are primarily interested in locking in long-term contracts, either a point-to-point or a portfolio sale. You may recall that before we take a project to -- an LNG project to a final investment decision that we will lock in a majority of those volumes on a long-term contract. We've been -- really developed a very strong reputation and credibility with the buyers to our ability to deliver these projects on schedule and our responsiveness to managing through the contract terms.

As you know, let me just first talk about capital allocation. It's one of -- from our cash flow from operations, the first thing the corporation wants to do is go ahead and pay a reliable and growing dividend. The next thing is the remaining cash is put towards through to a investment program that has got to the point where we believe that we have maximized the value proposition for investments. If we've got enough cash to go ahead and invest it, to fund that investment program, then the remaining cash will either put -- be put forward to either a stock buyback -- share buybacks or paying down our debt. If we don't have enough cash, as you've seen us do in the recent past, we'll go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional debt. Because the service costs associated with that debt is more than benefited by the return we get from these investments. So it's important to recognize that while we are very mindful of prudently managing our cash, we also believe it's very important for us to continue to invest through the cycle.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite a challenging business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemical segments. ExxonMobil's diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct competitive advantage through the business cycle. 
We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals. While we continue to capture market savings in the current environment, we also remain resolute in our drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment. Finally, as I'll share with you today, the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments. We are effectively progressing selective, strategic investments while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safe, reliable operations. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw modest global economic growth in the third quarter. While the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth rates slowed in China and remained soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat, although volatile, whereas natural gas prices strengthened on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as production continued to outpace demand, and chemical commodity product margins remained strong, while specialty margins held relatively flat. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $0.63 per share. The  Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion, down 45% from the third quarter last year, reflecting the corporation's capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales were $6.3 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.1 billion and debt was $46.2 billion. 
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances increased from $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash, including shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.7 billion.
Moving now to Slide 7 to review our segmented results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were approximately flat to the prior year quarter, although below our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. 
In a sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $950 million on stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $620 million, down $738 million from a year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations, which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.13 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable and sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million, and all other items added $60 million, driven by lower operating expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, totaling just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 120,000 barrels per day as growth from projects and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due to third-party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day as new project volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per barrel, and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefiting from reduced operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 146,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or almost 4%. Liquids production dropped 119,000 barrels per day from downtime events, entitlement impacts and field decline. Natural gas production decreased 161 million cubic feet per day as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from U.S. work programs. 
Moving now to Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170 million. Other items, including lower operating costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains increased earnings by $580 million. As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. To date, more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model, resulting in an earnings impact of $380 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity, increased earnings by $240 million. All other items added a further $490 million, mostly from asset management gains and lower expenses. 
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $56 million from the prior year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings decreased $46 million sequentially, where stronger margins partly offset increased maintenance activity. 
Moving now to Slide 17. The key to delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating costs down, especially in the current business climate, with year-to-date CapEx and operating costs lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior year period. We strive to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total life cycle costs. 
With our global procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement with the service sector on developing and implementing lower-cost solutions. 
Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design and execution phases that capture these structural advantages, while ensuring high integrity in our operations. For example, by leveraging our Fast Drill Process and flat time reduction initiatives, we realized cumulative drilling savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved performance in places like Angola, Guyana and Russia. A hallmark of our success has been our committed focus across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower-cost alternatives, but also to enhance integrity and reliability, improve productivity, increase product value and minimize environmental impact. 
On Slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of proved reserves and asset impairments. Our results are in accordance with the rules and standards of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves. As I indicated, our reporting is consistent with the SEC rules, which prescribe technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical 12-month average of ""first day of the month"" prices in a given year. As such, the low-price environment impacted our 2015 reserves replacement, resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas reserves being reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels, primarily in the U.S., reflecting the change in natural gas prices, offset by liquid additions of 1.9 billion barrels. 
Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on the SEC pricing basis, we anticipate that certain quantities of currently booked reserves, such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands, will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with end of field life production for certain other liquids and natural gas operations in North America also may not qualify. 
However, as you know, amounts required to be de-booked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked in the future when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the de-booking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect the operation of these assets or to alter our outlook for future production volumes. And you can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K. 
Now regarding asset impairments. We follow U.S. GAAP, successful efforts. And under this standard, assessments are made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. This is different than the SEC price basis for reserves that I just described. 
As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year, we undertook an effort to assess our major long-life assets most at risk for potential impact. The price basis used in this assessment was generally consistent with long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that the future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value. Again, this is detailed in our 2015 10-K. 
In light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-life assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our year-end financial statements.  
Moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on efforts to further enhance our development portfolio and advance major projects. First in Guyana, the Liza-3 appraisal well was successfully completed in October, increasing our confidence in the areal extent of this world-class resource. Well results now confirm the Liza discovery to be in excess of 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels. These results are being incorporated into early engineering plans for the initial phase of 100,000-barrel per day development. The Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Payara exploration prospect located approximately 10 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 discovery. Payara is expected to be completed late this year or early next year. After which, the rig will move to another exploration opportunity, also on the Stabroek block. 
In West Africa, the Owowo-3 well located approximately 56 miles offshore Angola, reached target depth in October and discovered significant oil resources. This well builds on our successful Owowo-2 well drilled in 2012 on the neighboring license. Together, these wells confirm a 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrel oil discovery. 
ExxonMobil continues to invest in its exploration activity to grow our prospect inventory across the globe. Recognizing the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing countercyclically in large-scale seismic acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data, covering diverse geological basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Ireland, South Africa and Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advanced seismic imaging and high-performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data. 
In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large-scale developments. The Kashegan project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable restart of production in October. Work is ongoing to safely and gradually increase production to a target level of 370,000 barrels per day over the next year. 
In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped 4 LNG cargoes from Gorgon since August, and a second LNG train has now started up. In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron Utilities and Process Module, or UPM, was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The topsides, including UPM, will next be mated with the concrete gravity base structure shown on the background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to start up by year-end 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. This slide illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions, and together with a moderate increase in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through this cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities. 
ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015. 
Moving now to Slide 21. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through this cycle. Year-to-date, corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated $16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, benefiting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we anticipate that full year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million barrels per day driven by our value-based choices. 
ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline regardless of the business environment. Year-to-date capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend distributions totaled $9.3 billion. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

So Neil, if you think back and look at where we've been here in the recent past, I'll start with the demand. Demand has been generally reasonably strong. I mean, when you think about a 10-year average demand growth of somewhere between 1 to 1.1 million barrels per day since 2014, we're seeing demand growth in excess of that. So fairly reasonable demand growth in the recent past. If you look -- focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in oversupply situation, with the production exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, it's -- we are seeing convergence in the second half. But I'll tell you that as you continue to progress that, we'll probably end up this year oversupplied by anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million to 1 million barrels per day of supply. Now of course, all this is going into commercial inventories. So as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see convergence, maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But I'd caution that we got to recognize that there's still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial inventory build since the end of 2013 that's got to come out of inventory at some point. And then, of course, there's still uncertainties in the supply trend. Some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. unconventionals will have an influence on the supply-demand balance. So I think when you heard Rex's comments, he was reflecting on all these factors as to how that will impact price in the near to medium term."

It has given us confidence in terms of the areal extent, the reservoir quality. And thus, our communication that we believe we're in excess of 1 billion barrels now. We're completing the Liza-3 well. As I indicated, we'll move on to an exploration well, which is to the northwest of the Liza discovery. We are integrating real time all of this well data. And of course, we took very extensive 3D seismic survey. And all that's being integrated into our development planning. So in short, I'd say we're very encouraged by, not only Liza, but the prospectivity on the block. And we see this as a high-quality asset for the corporation. Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I tell you that this is a continuation of an initial discovery. The Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery, but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper objective. So again, very encouraging. As I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrels oil discovery. And we will clearly integrate to -- that into our development planning. I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization in its integration is able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development there. So I think it's a great example about the value we can bring from the general interest integration of the corporation."

But at the same time, we're also very alert to where there may be some value propositions from acquisitions. And I think the InterOil transaction is a really good example. We discovered a substantial resource base in Papua New Guinea. We've continued our exploration activity, looking towards an expansion of the existing LNG facility. And in addition to that, we saw the opportunity for synergies, value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically, the Elk-Antelope resource that we could combine with our existing resources there.

And from an ethylene perspective, we're expecting that chemical demand will grow such that you add -- need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new capacity per year. And to put that into hardware, that would be 3 to 4 world-scale crackers per year. So that really is -- that sets up the value proposition. First, as you know, we're expanding the Baytown complex to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity, a corresponding investment at Mont Belvieu, adding derivative units to produce ExxonMobil's high-value metallocene polyethylene. And then we announced -- to your question, we announced a potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast that would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker to produce ethylene of about 1.8 million tons per annum and a corresponding derivative units that would be built alongside that.

Nothing's really slowed down in that regard in how we're working through the -- maximizing the value proposition for those investments. And as I've said earlier, we're trying to take full advantage of the cycle benefits. On the short-cycle side, you may recall -- and I think the number you're picking up with is in our unconventional program we shared in March that we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture higher -- a higher-price environment in our unconventional program to the order of magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So we've got a lot of flexibility in our short-cycle program. And then you think about what really sets the balance between short- and long-cycle investment. And the way I think about it, from a short-cycle perspective, Doug, it's really maintaining a program in a low-price environment that allows us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits.

We are primarily interested in locking in long-term contracts, either a point-to-point or a portfolio sale.

The next thing is the remaining cash is put towards through to a investment program that has gotten to the point where we believe that we have maximized the value proposition for investments. If we've got enough cash to go ahead and invest it, to fund that investment program, then the remaining cash will either put -- be put forward to either a stock buyback -- share buybacks or paying down our debt. If we don't have enough cash, as you've seen us do in the recent past, we'll go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional debt. Because the service costs associated with that debt is more than benefited by the return we get from these investments.

Well, I mean, I really want to be careful not to speculate on what prices we'll do in the future. But I will tell you, as I -- as we discussed a little bit earlier, that our investment, our long-cycle investment plans are progressing. When we believe those investments are at a point of maturity, where we have optimized on value, then we'll make an FID decision. Recall that we're making those decisions by our long-term view on supply and demand. We're very constructive on long-term energy demand, and that's what's really informing those long-cycle investments. It's not -- it is not what current prices are doing, okay? Now having said that, we balance that with other factors that we may be able to capture some incremental value in the near term. And it causes us to pace those investments out on a longer cycle in order to make sure that we're fully capturing the value. On the short-cycle investments, as I alluded to earlier, we want to keep activity levels in a down cycle commensurate with the learning curve benefits that we've been realizing, such that we are enhancing value across the full portfolio. But it doesn't makes sense to do much more beyond that if you recognize that you want to optimize value. But as we -- as I responded to Doug earlier, we're very well poised to go ahead and pick up activity on the short-cycle investments if supported by the business climate. And we've got flexibility to do so."

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. 
Turning now to Slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite a challenging business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemical segments. ExxonMobil's diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct competitive advantage through the business cycle. 
We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals. While we continue to capture market savings in the current environment, we also remain resolute in our drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment. Finally, as I'll share with you today, the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments. We are effectively progressing selective, strategic investments while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safe, reliable operations. 
Moving to Slide 4. We provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw modest global economic growth in the third quarter. While the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth rates slowed in China and remained soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat, although volatile, whereas natural gas prices strengthened on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as production continued to outpace demand, and chemical commodity product margins remained strong, while specialty margins held relatively flat. 
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $0.63 per share. The  Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion, down 45% from the third quarter last year, reflecting the corporation's capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales were $6.3 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.1 billion and debt was $46.2 billion. 
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances increased from $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash, including shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.7 billion.
Moving now to Slide 7 to review our segmented results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were approximately flat to the prior year quarter, although below our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. 
In a sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $950 million on stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges. 
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $620 million, down $738 million from a year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations, which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.13 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable and sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million, and all other items added $60 million, driven by lower operating expenses. 
Moving to Slide 10. Oil-equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, totaling just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 120,000 barrels per day as growth from projects and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due to third-party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day as new project volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts. 
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per barrel, and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefiting from reduced operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects. 
Moving to Slide 12. Sequentially, volumes decreased 146,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or almost 4%. Liquids production dropped 119,000 barrels per day from downtime events, entitlement impacts and field decline. Natural gas production decreased 161 million cubic feet per day as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from U.S. work programs. 
Moving now to Downstream results, starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170 million. Other items, including lower operating costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains increased earnings by $580 million. As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. To date, more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model, resulting in an earnings impact of $380 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity, increased earnings by $240 million. All other items added a further $490 million, mostly from asset management gains and lower expenses. 
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15. Third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $56 million from the prior year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Slide 16. Chemical earnings decreased $46 million sequentially, where stronger margins partly offset increased maintenance activity. 
Moving now to Slide 17. The key to delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating costs down, especially in the current business climate, with year-to-date CapEx and operating costs lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior year period. We strive to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total life cycle costs. 
With our global procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement with the service sector on developing and implementing lower-cost solutions. 
Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design and execution phases that capture these structural advantages, while ensuring high integrity in our operations. For example, by leveraging our Fast Drill Process and flat time reduction initiatives, we realized cumulative drilling savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved performance in places like Angola, Guyana and Russia. A hallmark of our success has been our committed focus across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower-cost alternatives, but also to enhance integrity and reliability, improve productivity, increase product value and minimize environmental impact. 
On Slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of proved reserves and asset impairments. Our results are in accordance with the rules and standards of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves. As I indicated, our reporting is consistent with the SEC rules, which prescribe technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical 12-month average of ""first day of the month"" prices in a given year. As such, the low-price environment impacted our 2015 reserves replacement, resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas reserves being reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels, primarily in the U.S., reflecting the change in natural gas prices, offset by liquid additions of 1.9 billion barrels. 
Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on the SEC pricing basis, we anticipate that certain quantities of currently booked reserves, such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands, will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with ""end of field life"" production for certain other liquids and natural gas operations in North America also may not qualify. 
However, as you know, amounts required to be de-booked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked in the future when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the de-booking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect the operation of these assets or to alter our outlook for future production volumes. And you can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K. 
Now regarding asset impairments. We follow U.S. GAAP, successful efforts. And under this standard, assessments are made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. This is different than the SEC price basis for reserves that I just described. 
As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year, we undertook an effort to assess our major long-life assets most at risk for potential impact. The price basis used in this assessment was generally consistent with long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that the future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value. Again, this is detailed in our 2015 10-K. 
In light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-life assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our year-end financial statements.  
Moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on efforts to further enhance our development portfolio and advance major projects. First in Guyana, the Liza-3 appraisal well was successfully completed in October, increasing our confidence in the areal extent of this world-class resource. Well results now confirm the Liza discovery to be in excess of 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels. These results are being incorporated into early engineering plans for the initial phase of 100,000-barrel per day development. The Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Payara exploration prospect located approximately 10 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 discovery. Payara is expected to be completed late this year or early next year. After which, the rig will move to another exploration opportunity, also on the Stabroek block. 
In West Africa, the Owowo-3 well located approximately 56 miles offshore Angola, reached target depth in October and discovered significant oil resources. This well builds on our successful Owowo-2 well drilled in 2012 on the neighboring license. Together, these wells confirm a 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrel oil discovery. 
ExxonMobil continues to invest in its exploration activity to grow our prospect inventory across the globe. Recognizing the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing countercyclically in large-scale seismic acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data, covering diverse geological basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Ireland, South Africa and Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advanced seismic imaging and high-performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data. 
In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large-scale developments. The Kashagan project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable restart of production in October. Work is ongoing to safely and gradually increase production to a target level of 370,000 barrels per day over the next year. 
In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped 4 LNG cargoes from Gorgon since August, and a second LNG train has now started up. In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron Utilities and Process Module, or UPM, was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The topsides, including UPM, will next be mated with the concrete gravity base structure shown on the background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to start up by year-end 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. This slide illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions, and together with a moderate increase in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through this cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities. 
ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015. 
Moving now to Slide 21. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through this cycle. Year-to-date, corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated $16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, benefiting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we anticipate that full year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million barrels per day driven by our value-based choices. 
ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline regardless of the business environment. Year-to-date capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend distributions totaled $9.3 billion. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions."

I mean, when you think about a 10-year average demand growth of somewhere between 1 to 1.1 million barrels per day since 2014, we're seeing demand growth in excess of that. So fairly reasonable demand growth in the recent past. If you look -- focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in oversupply situation, with the production exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, it's -- we are seeing convergence in the second half. But I'll tell you that as you continue to progress that, we'll probably end up this year oversupplied by anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million to 1 million barrels per day of supply. Now of course, all this is going into commercial inventories. So as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see convergence, maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But I'd caution that we got to recognize that there's still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial inventory build since the end of 2013 that's got to come out of inventory at some point. And then, of course, there's still uncertainties in the supply trend. Some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. unconventionals will have an influence on the supply-demand balance. So I think when you heard Rex's comments, he was reflecting on all these factors as to how that will impact price in the near to medium term."

As I indicated, we'll move on to an exploration well, which is to the northwest of the Liza discovery. We are integrating real time all of this well data. And of course, we took very extensive 3D seismic survey. And all that's being integrated into our development planning. So in short, I'd say we're very encouraged by, not only Liza, but the prospectivity on the block. And we see this as a high-quality asset for the corporation. Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I tell you that this is a continuation of an initial discovery. The Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery, but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper objective. So again, very encouraging. As I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrels oil discovery. And we will clearly integrate to -- that into our development planning. I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization in its integration is able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development there. So I think it's a great example about the value we can bring from the general interest integration of the corporation."

When we get to the point in the asset's life where we don't think that there's that much incremental value, that's when we put it into our process of considering how else can you monetize that asset. But at the same time, we're also very alert to where there may be some value propositions from acquisitions. And I think the InterOil transaction is a really good example. We discovered a substantial resource base in Papua New Guinea. We've continued our exploration activity, looking towards an expansion of the existing LNG facility. And in addition to that, we saw the opportunity for synergies, value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically, the Elk-Antelope resource that we could combine with our existing resources there.

So I mean, like most everything in ExxonMobil, it all starts with our view on the long-term energy supply-demand picture.

So I mean, like most everything in ExxonMobil, it all starts with our view on the long-term energy supply-demand picture. And when you think about chemicals, the chemical demand growth, based on our latest outlook, has -- from an overall perspective, chemical growing about 1% above GDP. And from an ethylene perspective, we're expecting that chemical demand will grow such that you add -- need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new capacity per year. And to put that into hardware, that would be 3 to 4 world-scale crackers per year. So that really is -- that sets up the value proposition. First, as you know, we're expanding the Baytown complex to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity, a corresponding investment at Mont Belvieu, adding derivative units to produce ExxonMobil's high-value metallocene polyethylene. And then we announced -- to your question, we announced a potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast that would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker to produce ethylene of about 1.8 million tons per annum and a corresponding derivative units that would be built alongside that. But I think the value proposition is there. I think we're ahead of the game in terms of making some world-scale investments in this and a very strong component of our Chemical business."

And of course, the experiences that we've realized during 2016 will be integrated into that, and we'll update that outlook going into the next Analyst Meeting in March of next year. As you reflect on our ability to pivot, remember, there's 2 components to our investment program. There's a very large component being our long-cycle investments. Nothing's really slowed down in that regard in how we're working through the -- maximizing the value proposition for those investments. And as I've said earlier, we're trying to take full advantage of the cycle benefits. On the short-cycle side, you may recall -- and I think the number you're picking up with is in our unconventional program we shared in March that we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture higher -- a higher-price environment in our unconventional program to the order of magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So we've got a lot of flexibility in our short-cycle program. And then you think about what really sets the balance between short- and long-cycle investment. And the way I think about it, from a short-cycle perspective, Doug, it's really maintaining a program in a low-price environment that allows us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits. You don't want to go much beyond that because you're trying also maximize value. So I think we're very well positioned. If you recall in the second quarter of last year -- of our last earnings call, we shared with you the -- some statistics around our unconventional program where we continue to drop the costs, and we have a pretty sizable ready inventory to go ahead and move on."

If we've got enough cash to go ahead and invest it, to fund that investment program, then the remaining cash will either put -- be put forward to either a stock buyback -- share buybacks or paying down our debt. If we don't have enough cash, as you've seen us do in the recent past, we'll go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional debt.

Break it up -- let's break it up into a couple of components, Ryan. First, I'd say that we want to make sure that all the learnings that we're getting from our capital efficiency efforts year-to-date are being integrated into those projects. And we've talked about how will we do this to reduce the upfront capital invested, like I've talked in the past about progressing projects in parallels that we can benefit from the learning curve in subsequent projects. So capturing the market response, capturing the capital efficiencies that we built in, in a low-price environment, as you've highlighted, there's times where we may want to go back and purchase some additional resources or do some exploration, like in Owowo to add additional resource to make the investment -- the project investment even more robust. The last thing I'd mention is the application of technology has been fundamental, absolutely fundamental to our past success and into the future. And you think about where you're getting those benefits across the full value chain, I mean, from the Downstream, our Chemical business where we use proprietary technology to provide high-value metallocene, to our unconventional business with fracking technology. So the application and the growth of these technology solutions has been a key element. And sometimes, some of these projects are really waiting on some of the technology work that's underway. So we've made great progress. I think we're very well positioned. We got a solid, diverse portfolio in which to go ahead and selectively invest into the future."

Well, I mean, I really want to be careful not to speculate on what prices we'll do in the future. But I will tell you, as I -- as we discussed a little bit earlier, that our investment, our long-cycle investment plans are progressing. When we believe those investments are at a point of maturity, where we have optimized on value, then we'll make an FID decision. Recall that we're making those decisions by our long-term view on supply and demand. We're very constructive on long-term energy demand, and that's what's really informing those long-cycle investments. It's not -- it is not what current prices are doing, okay? Now having said that, we balance that with other factors that we may be able to capture some incremental value in the near term. And it causes us to pace those investments out on a longer cycle in order to make sure that we're fully capturing the value. On the short-cycle investments, as I alluded to earlier, we want to keep activity levels in a down cycle commensurate with the learning curve benefits that we've been realizing, such that we are enhancing value across the full portfolio. But it doesn't makes sense to do much more beyond that if you recognize that you want to optimize value.
