Thanks to PACCAR's 23,000 employees around the world, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company with many records established. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.1 billion and record net income of $1.6 billion, and af",713,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning. Thanks to PACCAR's 23,000 employees around the world, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company with many records established. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.1 billion and record net income of $1.6 billion, and after-tax return on revenues of 8.4%. Net income increased 18% versus the prior year. 2015 was PACCAR's 77th consecutive year of earning on net income. These excellent results reflect the strongest North American heavy truck market since 2006 and the highest European heavy truck market since 2008. 
In addition, PACCAR Parts earned record pretax income and PACCAR Financial Services achieved another strong profit year. PACCAR celebrated several important milestones in our 110th anniversary year. These included the delivery of DAF's 1 millionth truck, the production of the 100,000 engine in our Mississippi engine factory and 35th anniversary celebrations at Peterbilt's Dent in Texas factory and in PACCAR Leasing. During the year, PACCAR continued investing in premium quality products and services in our core markets, and expanding our presence in emerging markets to provide the foundation for future growth. 
PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and quarterly net income was $347 million, a strong 8.8% after-tax return on revenues. During the quarter, European truck deliveries increased, partially offsetting reduced North American truck deliveries. The strong contribution of all companies segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry. PACCAR declared cash dividends up $2.30 per share last year, a 25% increase compared to 2014 and the highest total dividend in company history. 
The regular quarterly dividend was raised by 9% during the year. PACCAR's total dividends in 2015 provided a yield of over 4%, which is in the top 100 companies in the S&P 500. During 2015, PACCAR repurchased 3.8 million shares of its stock for $202 million. PACCAR delivered 35,400 trucks during the fourth quarter in line with expectations. Vehicle deliveries, and truck and other margins in the first quarter this year are projected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved a good market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada heavy duty truck market in 2015. Class 8 truck industry retail sales totaled 278,000 units for the year. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth also achieved a record 17.4% share of the U.S. and Canadian medium duty truck market last year, resulting in a record 27,300 medium duty truck deliveries for PACCAR. 2016 will be another good year for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck market with retail sales estimated to be in the range of 230,000 to 260,000 units. Additional good news is that Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer inventories are in great shape entering this year. 
DAF increase its market share to 14.6% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year compared to 13.8% in 2014. The market was a strong 269,000 units in 2015. Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne market has the potential to expand further and be in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles. Economic growth in Europe is expected to increase this year to 1.7% with more than 2% growth anticipated in the U.K., DAF's largest market. 
PACCAR Parts generated record pretax profit of $556 million and strong revenues of $3.1 billion in 2015. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, high fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. During the year, PACCAR Parts set records for parts deliveries to fleets, online part sales and TRP part sales for all makes of trucks and trailers. For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $750 million and pretax income of $126 million. 
Our expectation for 2016 is that parts and revenues -- is that parts revenues, excluding the effects of currency movements could increased 3% to 5%. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $293 million in the fourth quarter and pretax income was $90 million. The good results benefited from continuing strong portfolio performance. PACCAR leasing ended the year with a record 39,000 units its full service lease portfolio. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pretax income of $363 million. 
At this point, I'm going to have Michael Barkley address the effects of currency movements on our segment operations."

Thanks to PACCAR's 23,000 employees around the world. 2015 was an outstanding year for the company with many records established. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.1 billion and record net income of $1.6 billion, and after-tax return on revenues of 8.4%. Net income increased 18% versus the prior year. 2015 was PACCAR's 77th consecutive year of earning on net income. These excellent results reflect the strongest North American heavy truck market since 2006 and the highest European heavy truck market since 2008. 
In addition, PACCAR Parts earned record pretax income and PACCAR Financial Services achieved another strong profit year. PACCAR celebrated several important milestones in our 110th anniversary year. These included the delivery of DAF's 1 millionth truck, the production of the 100,000 engine in our Mississippi Engine factory and 35th anniversary celebrations at Peterbilt's Denton Texas factory and at PACCAR Leasing. During the year, PACCAR continued investing in premium quality products and services in our core markets, and expanding our presence in emerging markets to provide the foundation for future growth. 
PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and quarterly net income was $347 million, a strong 8.8% after-tax return on revenues. During the quarter, European truck deliveries increased, partially offsetting reduced North American truck deliveries. The strong contribution of all company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry. PACCAR declared cash dividends of $2.30 per share last year, a 25% increase compared to 2014 and the highest total dividend in company history.
The regular quarterly dividend was raised by 9% during the year. PACCAR's total dividends in 2015 provided a yield of over 4%, which is in the top 100 companies in the S&P 500. During 2015, PACCAR repurchased 3.8 million shares of its stock for $202 million. PACCAR delivered 35,400 trucks during the fourth quarter in line with expectations. Vehicle deliveries, and truck and other margins in the first quarter this year are projected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved a good market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada heavy duty truck market in 2015. Class 8 truck industry retail sales totaled 278,000 units for the year. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth also achieved a record 17.4% share of the U.S. and Canadian medium duty truck market last year, resulting in a record 27,300 medium duty truck deliveries for PACCAR. 2016 will be another good year for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck market with retail sales estimated to be in a range of 230,000 to 260,000 units. Additional good news is that Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer inventories are in great shape entering this year.
DAF increased its market share to 14.6% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year compared to 13.8% in 2014. The market was a strong 269,000 units in 2015. 
Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne truck market has the potential to expand further and be in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles. Economic growth in Europe is expected to increase this year to 1.7% with more than 2% growth anticipated in the U.K., DAF's largest market. 
PACCAR Parts generated record pretax profit of $556 million and strong revenues of $3.1 billion in 2015. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, high fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. During the year, PACCAR Parts set records for parts deliveries to fleets, online part sales and TRP part sales for all makes of trucks and trailers. For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $750 million and pretax income of $126 million. 
Our expectation for 2016 is that parts and revenues -- is that parts revenues, excluding the effects of currency movements could increase 3% to 5%. 
PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $293 million in the fourth quarter and pretax income was $90 million. The good results benefited from continuing strong portfolio performance. PACCAR leasing ended the year with a record 39,000 units in its full service lease portfolio. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pretax income of $363 million.
At this point, I'm going to have Michael Barkley address the effects of currency movements on our segment operations."

Thanks to PACCAR's 23,000 employees around the world, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company with many records established. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.1 billion and record net income of $1.6 billion and after-tax return on revenues of 8.4%. Net income increased 18% versus the prior year. 2015 was PACCAR's 77th consecutive year of earning a net income. These excellent results reflect the strongest North American heavy truck market since 2006 and the highest European heavy truck market since 2008. 
In addition, PACCAR Parts earned record pretax income and PACCAR Financial Services achieved another strong profit year. PACCAR celebrated several important milestones in our 110th anniversary year. These included the delivery of DAF's 1 millionth truck, the production of the 100,000th engine in our Mississippi Engine factory and 35th anniversary celebrations at Peterbilt's Denton, Texas factory and at PACCAR Leasing. During the year, PACCAR continued investing in premium quality products and services in our core markets and expanding our presence in emerging markets to provide the foundation for future growth. 
PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion, and quarterly net income was $347 million, a strong 8.8% after-tax return on revenues. During the quarter, European truck deliveries increased, partially offsetting reduced North American truck deliveries. The strong contribution of all company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry. PACCAR declared cash dividends of $2.30 per share last year, a 25% increase compared to 2014 and the highest total dividend in company history.
The regular quarterly dividend was raised by 9% during the year. PACCAR's total dividends in 2015 provided a yield of over 4%, which is in the top 100 companies in the S&P 500. During 2015, PACCAR repurchased 3.8 million shares of its stock for $202 million. PACCAR delivered 35,400 trucks during the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. Vehicle deliveries and truck and other margins in the first quarter this year are projected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved a good market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada heavy duty truck market in 2015. Class 8 truck industry retail sales totaled 278,000 units for the year. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth also achieved a record 17.4% share of the U.S. and Canadian medium-duty truck market last year, resulting in a record 27,300 medium-duty truck deliveries for PACCAR. 2016 will be another good year for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck market, with retail sales estimated to be in a range of 230,000 to 260,000 units. Additional good news is that Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer inventories are in great shape entering this year.
DAF increased its market share to 14.6% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year compared to 13.8% in 2014. The market was a strong 269,000 units in 2015. 
Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne truck market has the potential to expand further and be in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles. Economic growth in Europe is expected to increase this year to 1.7% with more than 2% growth anticipated in the U.K., DAF's largest market. 
PACCAR Parts generated record pretax profit of $556 million and strong revenues of $3.1 billion in 2015. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, high fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. During the year, PACCAR Parts set records for parts deliveries to fleets, online part sales and TRP part sales for all makes of trucks and trailers. For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $750 million and pretax income of $126 million. 
Our expectation for 2016 is that parts and revenues -- is that parts revenues, excluding the effects of currency movements could increase 3% to 5%. 
PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $293 million in the fourth quarter, and pretax income was $90 million. The good results benefited from continuing strong portfolio performance. PACCAR leasing ended the year with a record 39,000 units in its full service lease portfolio. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pretax income of $363 million.
At this point, I'm going to have Michael Barkley address the effects of currency movements on our segment operations."

Thanks to PACCAR's 23,000 employees around the world, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company with many records established. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.1 billion and record net income of $1.6 billion and after-tax return on revenues of 8.4%. Net income increased 18% versus the prior year. 2015 was PACCAR's 77th consecutive year of earning a net income. These excellent results reflect the strongest North American heavy truck market since 2006 and the highest European heavy truck market since 2008. 
In addition, PACCAR Parts earned record pretax income and PACCAR Financial Services achieved another strong profit year. PACCAR celebrated several important milestones in our 110th anniversary year. These included the delivery of DAF's 1 millionth truck, the production of the 100,000th engine in our Mississippi Engine factory and 35th anniversary celebrations at Peterbilt's Denton, Texas factory and at PACCAR Leasing. During the year, PACCAR continued investing in premium quality products and services in our core markets and expanding our presence in emerging markets to provide the foundation for future growth. 
PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion, and quarterly net income was $347 million, a strong 8.8% after-tax return on revenues. During the quarter, European truck deliveries increased, partially offsetting reduced North American truck deliveries. The strong contribution of all company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry. PACCAR declared cash dividends of $2.30 per share last year, a 25% increase compared to 2014 and the highest total dividend in company history.
The regular quarterly dividend was raised by 9% during the year. PACCAR's total dividends in 2015 provided a yield of over 4%, which is in the top 100 companies in the S&P 500. During 2015, PACCAR repurchased 3.8 million shares of its stock for $202 million. PACCAR delivered 35,400 trucks during the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. Vehicle deliveries and truck and other margins in the first quarter this year are projected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved a good market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada heavy duty truck market in 2015. Class 8 truck industry retail sales totaled 278,000 units for the year. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth also achieved a record 17.4% share of the U.S. and Canadian medium-duty truck market last year, resulting in a record 27,300 medium-duty truck deliveries for PACCAR. 2016 will be another good year for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck market, with retail sales estimated to be in a range of 230,000 to 260,000 units. Additional good news is that Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer inventories are in great shape entering this year.
DAF increased its market share to 14.6% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year compared to 13.8% in 2014. The market was a strong 269,000 units in 2015. 
Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne truck market has the potential to expand further and be in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles. Economic growth in Europe is expected to increase this year to 1.7% with more than 2% growth anticipated in the U.K., DAF's largest market. 
PACCAR Parts generated record pretax profit of $556 million and strong revenues of $3.1 billion in 2015. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, high fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. During the year, PACCAR Parts set records for parts deliveries to fleets, online part sales and TRP part sales for all makes of trucks and trailers. For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $750 million and pretax income of $126 million. 
Our expectation for 2016 is that parts and revenues -- is that parts revenues, excluding the effects of currency movements could increase 3% to 5%. 
PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $293 million in the fourth quarter, and pretax income was $90 million. The good results benefited from continuing strong portfolio performance. PACCAR leasing ended the year with a record 39,000 units in its full service lease portfolio. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pretax income of $363 million.
At this point, I'm going to have Michael Barkley address the effects of currency movements on our segment operations."

PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the first quarter of 2016. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.3 billion, and first quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $348 m",640,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the first quarter of 2016. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.3 billion, and first quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $348 million, an 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. Adjusted net income excludes the $943 million non-recurring charge for their European Commission investigation of all European truck manufacturers. Including the non-recurring charge PACCAR reported a net loss of $595 million in the first quarter. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.9%, helped by the strong European truck market. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. PACCAR delivered 35,300 trucks during the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were over 30% higher than last year's first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in deliveries in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Second quarter gross margins are projected to be comparable to the strong first quarter margins, reflecting the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, the benefits of steady build rates, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. PACCAR's forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market is a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units, reflecting strong demand and a steady economic outlook. Europe's GDP growth expectations for this year are 2% in the U.K., which is DAF's largest market and 1.5% on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first quarter was up 4% over the same period last year. Year-to-date, DAF has achieved a record 16.6% share of the heavy-duty market. The economic picture in the U.S. remains positive, with GDP forecast to grow 2.1% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to over $1.2 million and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.5 million vehicles, which would be a record. Other positive signals are that the ISM manufacturing index has returned to expansion and manufacturing inventories in the economy appear to be stabilizing. 
We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in the range of 220,000 to 250,000 units this year, the third best in the last decade. The economy's steady growth is supportive of healthy freight levels. The 88 tonnage continued at record levels. Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. Canadian market is 26% year-to-date. Our share of net orders so far this year is strong at 37% as customers appreciate the benefits of Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable and fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. 
PACCAR's Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $720 million compared to $753 million in the same quarter of last year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $135 million, an excellent return on revenue of 18.7%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization. The growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. PACCAR Financial Services first quarter pretax income was $80 million compared to $89 million a year ago. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest $3.3 billion in new products and facilities in the last 5 years. PACCAR's capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development. Research and development expenses are estimated to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. 
PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry. Thank you. And I'd be pleased to answer your questions. Operator?"

PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the first quarter of 2016. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.3 billion, and first quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $348 m",641,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the first quarter of 2016. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.3 billion, and first quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $348 million, an 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. 
Adjusted net income excludes a $943 million non-recurring charge for the European Commission investigation of all European truck manufacturers. Including the non-recurring charge, PACCAR reported a net loss of $595 million in the first quarter. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.9%, helped by the strong European truck market. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
PACCAR delivered 35,300 trucks during the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were over 30% higher than last year's first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in deliveries in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Second quarter gross margins are projected to be comparable to the strong first quarter margins, reflecting the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, the benefits of steady build rates, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. 
PACCAR's forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market is a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units, reflecting strong demand and a steady economic outlook. Europe's GDP growth expectations for this year are 2% in the U.K., which is DAF's largest market and 1.5% on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first quarter was up 4% over the same period last year. Year-to-date, DAF has achieved a record 16.6% share of the heavy-duty market. The economic picture in the U.S. remains positive, with GDP forecast to grow 2.1% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to over $1.2 million, and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.5 million vehicles, which would be a record. Other positive signals are that the ISM manufacturing index has returned to expansion and manufacturing inventories in the economy appear to be stabilizing. 
We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 220,000 to 250,000 units this year, the third best in the last decade. The economy's steady growth is supportive of healthy freight levels. The 88 tonnage index continued at record levels. Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. Canadian market is 26% year-to-date. Our share of net orders so far this year is strong at 37% as customers appreciate the benefits of Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable and fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. 
PACCAR's Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $720 million compared to $753 million in the same quarter of last year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $135 million, an excellent return on revenue of 18.7%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization. The growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. PACCAR Financial Services first quarter pretax income was $80 million compared to $89 million a year ago. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest $3.3 billion in new products and facilities in the last 5 years. PACCAR's capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development. Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $240 million to $260 million. 
PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry. Thank you. And I'd be pleased to answer your questions. Operator?"

The products are performing great in the field, so we've seen a good performance in our warranty cost during the quarter. So all the elements, just a good quarter of execution provided the results that we've seen.

294721,329398035,963090,"PACCAR Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","PACCAR Inc","Executives","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the first quarter of 2016. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.3 billion, and first quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $348 m",641,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the first quarter of 2016. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.3 billion, and first quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $348 million, an 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. 
Adjusted net income excludes a $943 million non-recurring charge for the European Commission investigation of all European truck manufacturers. Including the non-recurring charge, PACCAR reported a net loss of $595 million in the first quarter. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.9%, helped by the strong European truck market. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
PACCAR delivered 35,300 trucks during the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were over 30% higher than last year's first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in deliveries in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Second quarter gross margins are projected to be comparable to the strong first quarter margins, reflecting the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, the benefits of steady build rates, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. 
PACCAR's forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market is a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units, reflecting strong demand and a steady economic outlook. Europe's GDP growth expectations for this year are 2% in the U.K., which is DAF's largest market and 1.5% on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first quarter was up 4% over the same period last year. Year-to-date, DAF has achieved a record 16.6% share of the heavy-duty market. The economic picture in the U.S. remains positive, with GDP forecast to grow 2.1% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to over $1.2 million, and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.5 million vehicles, which would be a record. Other positive signals are that the ISM Manufacturing Index has returned to expansion and manufacturing inventories in the economy appear to be stabilizing. 
We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 220,000 to 250,000 units this year, the third best in the last decade. The economy's steady growth is supportive of healthy freight levels. The ATA tonnage index continues at record levels. Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. Canadian market is 26% year-to-date. Our share of net orders so far this year is strong at 37% as customers appreciate the benefits of Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable and fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. 
PACCAR's Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $720 million compared to $753 million in the same quarter of last year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $135 million, an excellent return on revenue of 18.7%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization, the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. PACCAR Financial Services' first quarter pretax income was $80 million compared to $89 million a year ago. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest $3.3 billion in new products and facilities in the last 5 years. PACCAR's capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development. Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $240 million to $260 million. 
PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry. Thank you. And I'd be pleased to answer your questions. Operator?"

So first quarter, we had an excellent quarter from an execution standpoint. Our plants had steady build rates, as I mentioned, and so able to operate the plants very efficiently during the quarter, continue to see favorable benefits from some of the material cost movement that our purchasing and materials teams are providing with our suppliers, working closely with them to provide good value for our customers. The products are performing great in the field, so we've seen a good performance in our warranty cost during the quarter. So all the elements, just a good quarter of execution provided the results that we've seen. As we look forward for the full year margins, I think we'll still be in that 14.5% to 15% range for the full year at these build rates.

PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372",744,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372 million at 8.4% after-tax return on revenues. Adjusted net income excludes a favorable $109 million adjustment to the reserve established in the first quarter this year, reflecting the settlement of the European Commission investigation. 
Including the reserve adjustment, PACCAR reported net income of $481 million in the second quarter. PACCAR achieved excellent truck, parts and other gross margins of 15.2%, driven by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's premium products, DAF's strong 16% market share, a robust European truck market and rigorous cost control. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. PACCAR delivered 36,700 trucks during the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were 17% higher than last year's second quarter. 
In the third quarter, PACCAR deliveries will be slightly lower than the second quarter due to the normal summer shutdown at DAF. Third quarter gross margins are projected to remain strong but down slightly from the second quarter margins due to the lower production in Europe. PACCAR's industry-leading operating margins reflect the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, record plant operating efficiency, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. We've raised our forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 280,000 to 300,000 units reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook. 
The Eurozone's GDP growth expectations for this year are 1.5%. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first half of this year was up 3.4% over the same period last year. Since the vote in the U.K. to exit the European Union, DAF's truck orders, parts and service sales and finance sales continue at strong levels comparable to the period prior to the vote. The economic picture in the U.S. is positive with GDP forecast to grow 1.9% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to 1.2 million and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.2 million vehicles similar to last year's record sales. The ISN manufacturing index has been over 50 indicating expansion for the last 4 months. Consumer spending and disposable income are outgrowing the overall economy, which is supported of freight in the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in the range of 220,000 to 240,000 units this year, which is the third best in the last decade. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. and Canadian market was 28% in the second quarter. Our share of net orders so far this year is strong at 34% as customers benefit from Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable and fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $756 million, a 5% increase compared to the first quarter. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $133 million, with a return on revenues of 17.6%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization, the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation, and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. Second half part sales are expected to improve from first half levels. 
PACCAR Financial Services second quarter pretax income was $77 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial began providing retail financing in Romania, its 23rd country of operation.

PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372",744,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372 million and 8.4% after-tax return on revenues. Adjusted net income excludes a favorable $109 million adjustment to the reserve established in the first quarter this year, reflecting the settlement of the European Commission investigation.  Including the reserve adjustment, PACCAR reported net income of $481 million in the second quarter. 
PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 15.2%, driven by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's premium products; DAF's strong 16% market share; a robust European truck market and rigorous cost control. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
PACCAR delivered 36,700 trucks during the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were 17% higher than last year's second quarter. 
In the third quarter, PACCAR deliveries will be slightly lower than the second quarter due to the normal summer shutdown at DAF. Third quarter gross margins are projected to remain strong but down slightly from the second quarter margins due to the lower production in Europe. PACCAR's industry-leading operating margins reflect the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, record plant operating efficiency, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. 
We've raised our forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 280,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook. 
The Eurozone's GDP growth expectations for this year are 1.5%. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first half of this year was up 3.4% over the same period last year. Since the vote in the U.K. to exit the European Union, DAF's truck orders, parts and service sales and finance business continue at strong levels comparable to the period prior to the vote. 
The economic picture in the U.S. is positive with GDP forecast to grow 1.9% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to 1.2 million, and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.2 million vehicles, similar to last year's record sales. 
The ISM Manufacturing Index has been over 50, indicating expansion for the last 4 months. Consumer spending and disposable income are outgrowing the overall economy, which is supportive of freight in the truck industry. 
We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 220,000 to 240,000 units this year, which is the third best in the last decade. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. and Canadian market was 28% in the second quarter. Our share of net orders, so far this year, is strong at 34% as customers benefit from Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable, fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. 
PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $756 million, a 5% increase compared to the first quarter. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $133 million with a return on revenues of 17.6%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization, the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. Second half Parts sales are expected to improve from first half levels. 
PACCAR Financial Services second quarter pretax income was $77 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial began providing retail financing in Romania, its 23rd country of operation. PACCAR Financial also acquired land in the Chicago area to construct a new used truck center and expanded sales of Kenworth and Peterbilt premium used trucks. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest $6 billion in new products and facilities in the last 10 years. 
PACCAR achieved record net operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016. 
PACCAR's capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development. 
Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $240 million to $260 million. 
PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry. 
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."

294721,369945381,1012428,"PACCAR Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","PACCAR Inc","Executives","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372",744,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372 million and 8.4% after-tax return on revenues. Adjusted net income excludes a favorable $109 million adjustment to the reserve established in the first quarter this year, reflecting the settlement of the European Commission investigation.  Including the reserve adjustment, PACCAR reported net income of $481 million in the second quarter. 
PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 15.2%, driven by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's premium products; DAF's strong 16% market share; a robust European truck market and rigorous cost control. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
PACCAR delivered 36,700 trucks during the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were 17% higher than last year's second quarter. 
In the third quarter PACCAR deliveries will be slightly lower than the second quarter due to the normal summer shutdown at DAF. Third quarter gross margins are projected to remain strong but down slightly from the second quarter margins due to the lower production in Europe. PACCAR's industry-leading operating margins reflect the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, record plant operating efficiency, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. 
We've raised our forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 280,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook. 
The Eurozone's GDP growth expectations for this year are 1.5%. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first half of this year was up 3.4% over the same period last year. Since the vote in the U.K. to exit the European Union, DAF's truck orders, parts and service sales and finance business continue at strong levels comparable to the period prior to the vote. 
The economic picture in the U.S. is positive, with GDP forecast to grow 1.9% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to 1.2 million, and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.2 million vehicles, similar to last year's record sales. 
The ISM Manufacturing Index has been over 50, indicating expansion, for the last 4 months. Consumer spending and disposable income are outgrowing the overall economy, which is supportive of freight and the truck industry. 
We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in the range of 220,000 to 240,000 units this year, which is the third best in the last decade. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. and Canadian market was 28% in the second quarter. Our share of net orders so far this year is strong at 34%, as customers benefit from Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable, fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. 
PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $756 million, a 5% increase compared to the first quarter. PACCAR Parts' quarterly pretax income was $133 million with a return on revenues of 17.6%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization, the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. Second half Parts sales are expected to improve from first half levels. 
PACCAR Financial Services' second quarter pretax income was $77 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial began providing retail financing in Romania, its 23rd country of operation. PACCAR Financial also acquired land in the Chicago area to construct a new used truck center and expanded sales of Kenworth and Peterbilt premium used trucks. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest $6 billion in new products and facilities in the last 10 years. 
PACCAR achieved record net operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016. 
PACCAR's capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development. 
Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $240 million to $260 million. 
PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry. 
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."

And the Euro 6 -- DAF Euro 6 trucks are really earning a nice premium in the used market. In North America we have seen a reduction. Several of our competitors have sizable quantities of used truck inventories. That sort of dampened the entire market. The good news is that Peterbilt and Kenworth continue to enjoy a 10% to 15% premium relative to the competition, and that's part of the impact on PACCAR Financial Services last year. We were earning nice gains with a buoyant used truck market this year. Those gains have gone down as a result of just lower average sales prices."

PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372",744,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and excellent operating income for the second quarter of 2016. PACCAR's second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.4 billion and second quarter adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $372 million and 8.4% after-tax return on revenues. Adjusted net income excludes a favorable $109 million adjustment to the reserve established in the first quarter this year, reflecting the settlement of the European Commission investigation. Including the reserve adjustment, PACCAR reported net income of $481 million in the second quarter. 
PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 15.2%, driven by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's premium products; DAF's strong 16% market share; a robust European truck market and rigorous cost control. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
PACCAR delivered 36,700 trucks during the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Deliveries in Europe were 17% higher than last year's second quarter. 
In the third quarter, PACCAR deliveries will be slightly lower than the second quarter due to the normal summer shutdown at DAF. Third quarter gross margins are projected to remain strong but down slightly from the second quarter margins due to the lower production in Europe. PACCAR's industry-leading operating margins reflect the benefits of DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth's new truck models, record plant operating efficiency, good truck markets and continued material cost savings. 
We've raised our forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 280,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook. 
The Eurozone's GDP growth expectations for this year are 1.5%. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first half of this year was up 3.4% over the same period last year. Since the vote in the U.K. to exit the European Union, DAF's truck orders, parts and service sales and finance business continue at strong levels comparable to the period prior to the vote. 
The economic picture in the U.S. is positive with GDP forecast to grow 1.9% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to 1.2 million, and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.2 million vehicles, similar to last year's record sales. 
The ISM Manufacturing Index has been over 50, indicating expansion for the last 4 months. Consumer spending and disposable income are outgrowing the overall economy, which is supportive of freight and the truck industry. 
We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in the range of 220,000 to 240,000 units this year, which is the third best in the last decade. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth's combined retail sales market share of the U.S. and Canadian market was 28% in the second quarter. Our share of net orders so far this year is strong at 34% as customers benefit from Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable, fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values. 
PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $756 million, a 5% increase compared to the first quarter. PACCAR Parts' quarterly pretax income was $133 million with a return on revenues of 17.6%. These results were driven by good fleet utilization, the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. Second half Parts sales are expected to improve from first half levels. 
PACCAR Financial Services' second quarter pretax income was $77 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial began providing retail financing in Romania, its 23rd country of operation. PACCAR Financial also acquired land in the Chicago area to construct a new used truck center and expanded sales of Kenworth and Peterbilt premium used trucks. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest $6 billion in new products and facilities in the last 10 years. 
PACCAR achieved record net operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016. 
PACCAR's capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development. 
Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $240 million to $260 million. 
PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry. 
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."

PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenu",763,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.7%, driven by Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF premium products; a robust European truck market; strong part sales and rigorous cost control. 
Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved record quarterly Class 8 market share of 31% in the U.S. and Canada. DAF increased year-to-date heavy-duty market share in Europe to 15.6%. PACCAR's increasing its investments and delivering new products and technologies, as reflected in the recent introduction of the new PACCAR Axel, enhancements to PACCAR MX engines and the DAF Connect telematics system. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
This year marks the 20th anniversary of PACCAR's acquisition of DAF Trucks. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have achieved great synergies together. DAF has grown its market share from 9% to 15.6% in the last 20 years. DAF sells trucks, engines and aftermarket parts in over 100 countries worldwide. DAF's expertise in powertrain development contributed to the production of PACCAR MX  engines in North America, and 47% MX engine penetration in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. 
PACCAR delivered 34,900 trucks during the third quarter. Deliveries in Europe were 4% higher than last year's third quarter, with deliveries in the U.S. and Canada reflecting a lower market, partially offset by strong share growth. We've raised our 2016 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand in a steady economy. The Eurozone's GDP growth for this year is 1.5%, with 2017 projected at a similar level. 
Freight transport activity on German highways is up 3% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. And we expect the 2017 European heavy truck market to be another excellent year in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units. The U.S. economy is growing 1.5% this year as well. U.S. housing starts will grow 6% to 1.2 million units and the automotive industry will deliver 17.2 million vehicles comparable to last year's record sales. Our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is a range of 215,000 to 225,000 units. 
For 2017, economists are forecasting higher GDP growth of 2.2%, an increase in housing starts of 8% and strong auto sales of 17.1 million units. Industrial production is expected to grow nearly 2% next year, which should be good news for the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 200,000 to 230,000 units in 2017. PACCAR global truck deliveries in the fourth quarter are estimated to be about 5% lower than the third quarter due to more holidays and slightly lower build rates in North America. This is partially offset by higher build rates and more production days in Europe. 
Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the fourth quarter are forecast to be 50 to 100 basis points lower than the third quarter. PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $765 million. Parts quarterly pretax income was $338 million, with an excellent pretax return on revenue of 18.1%. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and expanding network of TRP stores and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. 
PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income was $71 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial enhanced its technology leadership with the introduction of a mobile sales and credit system, which allows customers and dealers to complete a loan application, receive an expedited credit decision and electronically sign a contract on a mobile device. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest over $6 billion in new products, technologies and facilities in the last 10 years. PACCAR estimates capital spending of $375 million to $400 million, and R&D expenses of $240 million to $250 million this year. In 2017, we forecast increased capital investments of $375 million to $425 million, and increased R&D expenses of $270 million to $300 million. 
These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. 
Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions."

With respect to used truck pricing. I think as we progress through next year, the customers are keeping their trucks perhaps a little bit longer. At some point though, the value intersects with the current market, and they'll be back in the market at some point to reinvesting new equipment. The new equipment has such attractive operating efficiencies with lower fuel consumption, better operating efficiency, the reliability and durability of the products are outstanding.

PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenu",763,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.7%, driven by Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF premium products; a robust European truck market; strong part sales and rigorous cost control. 
Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved record quarterly Class 8 market share of 31% in the U.S. and Canada. DAF increased year-to-date heavy-duty market share in Europe to 15.6%. PACCAR's increasing its investments and delivering new products and technologies, as reflected in the recent introduction of the new PACCAR axle, enhancements to PACCAR MX engines and the DAF Connect telematics system. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
This year marks the 20th anniversary of PACCAR's acquisition of DAF Trucks. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have achieved great synergies together. DAF has grown its market share from 9% to 15.6% in the last 20 years. DAF sells trucks, engines and aftermarket parts in over 100 countries worldwide. DAF's expertise in powertrain development contributed to the production of PACCAR MX  engines in North America, and 47% MX engine penetration in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. 
PACCAR delivered 34,900 trucks during the third quarter. Deliveries in Europe were 4% higher than last year's third quarter, with deliveries in the U.S. and Canada reflecting a lower market, partially offset by strong share growth. We've raised our 2016 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand in a steady economy. The Eurozone's GDP growth for this year is 1.5%, with 2017 projected at a similar level. 
Freight transport activity on German highways is up 3% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. And we expect the 2017 European heavy truck market to be another excellent year in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units. The U.S. economy is growing 1.5% this year as well. U.S. housing starts will grow 6% to 1.2 million units and the automotive industry will deliver 17.2 million vehicles comparable to last year's record sales. Our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is a range of 215,000 to 225,000 units. 
For 2017, economists are forecasting higher GDP growth of 2.2%, an increase in housing starts of 8% and strong auto sales of 17.1 million units. Industrial production is expected to grow nearly 2% next year, which should be good news for the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 200,000 to 230,000 units in 2017. PACCAR global truck deliveries in the fourth quarter are estimated to be about 5% lower than the third quarter due to more holidays and slightly lower build rates in North America. This is partially offset by higher build rates and more production days in Europe. 
Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the fourth quarter are forecast to be 50 to 100 basis points lower than the third quarter. PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $765 million. Parts quarterly pretax income was $338 million, with an excellent pretax return on revenue of 18.1%. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and expanding network of TRP stores and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. 
PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income was $71 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial enhanced its technology leadership with the introduction of a mobile sales and credit system, which allows customers and dealers to complete a loan application, receive an expedited credit decision and electronically sign a contract on a mobile device. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest over $6 billion in new products, technologies and facilities in the last 10 years. PACCAR estimates capital spending of $375 million to $400 million, and R&D expenses of $240 million to $250 million this year. In 2017, we forecast increased capital investments of $375 million to $425 million, and increased R&D expenses of $270 million to $300 million. 
These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.

PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenu",763,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.7%, driven by Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF premium products; a robust European truck market; strong part sales and rigorous cost control. 
Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved record quarterly Class 8 market share of 31% in the U.S. and Canada. DAF increased year-to-date heavy-duty market share in Europe to 15.6%. PACCAR's increasing its investments and delivering new products and technologies, as reflected in the recent introduction of the new PACCAR axle, enhancements to PACCAR MX engines and the DAF Connect telematics system. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
This year marks the 20th anniversary of PACCAR's acquisition of DAF Trucks. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have achieved great synergies together. DAF has grown its market share from 9% to 15.6% in the last 20 years. DAF sells trucks, engines and aftermarket parts in over 100 countries worldwide. DAF's expertise in powertrain development contributed to the production of PACCAR MX  engines in North America, and 47% MX engine penetration in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. 
PACCAR delivered 34,900 trucks during the third quarter. Deliveries in Europe were 4% higher than last year's third quarter, with deliveries in the U.S. and Canada reflecting a lower market, partially offset by strong share growth. We've raised our 2016 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand and a steady economy. The Eurozone's GDP growth for this year is 1.5%, with 2017 projected at a similar level. 
Freight transport activity on German highways is up 3% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. And we expect the 2017 European heavy truck market to be another excellent year in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units. The U.S. economy is growing 1.5% this year as well. U.S. housing starts will grow 6% to 1.2 million units and the automotive industry will deliver 17.2 million vehicles comparable to last year's record sales. Our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is a range of 215,000 to 225,000 units. 
For 2017, economists are forecasting higher GDP growth of 2.2%, an increase in housing starts of 8% and strong auto sales of 17.1 million units. Industrial production is expected to grow nearly 2% next year, which should be good news for the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 200,000 to 230,000 units in 2017. PACCAR global truck deliveries in the fourth quarter are estimated to be about 5% lower than the third quarter due to more holidays and slightly lower build rates in North America. This is partially offset by higher build rates and more production days in Europe. 
Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the fourth quarter are forecast to be 50 to 100 basis points lower than the third quarter. PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $765 million. Parts quarterly pretax income was $338 million, with an excellent pretax return on revenue of 18.1%. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation, an expanding network of TRP stores and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. 
PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income was $71 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial enhanced its technology leadership with the introduction of a mobile sales and credit system, which allows customers and dealers to complete a loan application, receive an expedited credit decision and electronically sign a contract on a mobile device. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest over $6 billion in new products, technologies and facilities in the last 10 years. PACCAR estimates capital spending of $375 million to $400 million, and R&D expenses of $240 million to $250 million this year. In 2017, we forecast increased capital investments of $375 million to $425 million, and increased R&D expenses of $270 million to $300 million. 
These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.

PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenu",763,"Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.7%, driven by Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF premium products; a robust European truck market; strong part sales and rigorous cost control. 
Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved record quarterly Class 8 market share of 31% in the U.S. and Canada. DAF increased year-to-date heavy-duty market share in Europe to 15.6%. PACCAR's increasing its investments and delivering new products and technologies, as reflected in the recent introduction of the new PACCAR axle, enhancements to PACCAR MX engines and the DAF Connect telematics system. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. 
This year marks the 20th anniversary of PACCAR's acquisition of DAF Trucks. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have achieved great synergies together. DAF has grown its market share from 9% to 15.6% in the last 20 years. DAF sells trucks, engines and aftermarket parts in over 100 countries worldwide. DAF's expertise in powertrain development contributed to the production of PACCAR MX engines in North America, and 47% MX engine penetration in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. 
PACCAR delivered 34,900 trucks during the third quarter. Deliveries in Europe were 4% higher than last year's third quarter, with deliveries in the U.S. and Canada reflecting a lower market, partially offset by strong share growth. We've raised our 2016 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand and a steady economy. The Eurozone's GDP growth for this year is 1.5%, with 2017 projected at a similar level. 
Freight transport activity on German highways is up 3% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. And we expect the 2017 European heavy truck market to be another excellent year in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units. The U.S. economy is growing 1.5% this year as well. U.S. housing starts will grow 6% to 1.2 million units and the automotive industry will deliver 17.2 million vehicles comparable to last year's record sales. Our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is a range of 215,000 to 225,000 units. 
For 2017, economists are forecasting higher GDP growth of 2.2%, an increase in housing starts of 8% and strong auto sales of 17.1 million units. Industrial production is expected to grow nearly 2% next year, which should be good news for the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 200,000 to 230,000 units in 2017. PACCAR global truck deliveries in the fourth quarter are estimated to be about 5% lower than the third quarter due to more holidays and slightly lower build rates in North America. This is partially offset by higher build rates and more production days in Europe. 
Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the fourth quarter are forecast to be 50 to 100 basis points lower than the third quarter. PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $765 million. Parts quarterly pretax income was $338 million, with an excellent pretax return on revenue of 18.1%. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation, an expanding network of TRP stores and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. 
PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income was $71 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial enhanced its technology leadership with the introduction of a mobile sales and credit system, which allows customers and dealers to complete a loan application, receive an expedited credit decision and electronically sign a contract on a mobile device. 
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest over $6 billion in new products, technologies and facilities in the last 10 years. PACCAR estimates capital spending of $375 million to $400 million, and R&D expenses of $240 million to $250 million this year. In 2017, we forecast increased capital investments of $375 million to $425 million, and increased R&D expenses of $270 million to $300 million. 
These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.

Since Brexit, have you had to put in a price increase to offset the FX headwind? And if so, about how much might that have been? And the second question is kind of following on David Raso's question about orders in 2017 and when they might inflect. Can they start to inflect upwards, given where used truck prices are now, given that it seems like people are -- or at least a lot of customers are upside down on trades?

We're very fortunate in that we're the only U.K. truck maker. So we have a bit of a natural hedge with respect to U.K. cost and prices. So we'll adjust pricing as the market needs to adjust to earn a fair return on our trucks over time. With respect to used truck pricing, I think as we progress through next year, customers are keeping their trucks perhaps a little bit longer. At some point, though, the value intersects with the current market, and they'll be back in the market at some point to reinvest in new equipment. The new equipment has such attractive operating efficiencies, with lower fuel consumption, better operating efficiency, the reliability and durability of the products are outstanding, so they -- you have to upgrade at some point to take advantage of those features that are on the newer products."
