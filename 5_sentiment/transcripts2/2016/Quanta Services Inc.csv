Welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with the strategic and operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chi",2340,"Thank you, Kip, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with the strategic and operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
Our fourth quarter results, excluding unusual financial items, met our expectations, which I believe sets a positive tempo as we close at what was a challenging year for the company and the overall industry. Many of the challenges we faced in 2015 resulted from factors outside of our control such as the collapse in oil prices and in particular, its effect on the Canadian economy, several severe weather events, project delays due to a challenging permitting environment and a sudden shift in small transmission market dynamics, all of which impacted our top line, margins and profitability.
However, there were things we should have done better. For example, the unusual occurrence of a significant project loss we incurred on the combined cycle gas power plant we're building in Alaska. That said, we booked significant mainline backlog in 2015 and expect additional mainline awards this year, which should be a catalyst for profitable growth for Quanta in 2016.
As we transition from a challenging 2015 into '16, I believe it is an appropriate time to review our strategies for long-term growth and competitive differentiation as well as discuss the near- and longer-term drivers of the markets we serve. Though our end markets are experiencing some near-term challenges that create uncertainty, we believe uncertainty credits opportunity, and we are actively pursuing strategic initiatives that we believe will lay the groundwork for success in the upcoming years.
A unique but critical driver of Quanta's success is the decentralized and entrepreneurial business model that Quanta embraces. Since Quanta's IPO in 1998, we have completed nearly 200 acquisitions through which we acquired some of the best operators in our industries and strategically expanded into different geographies and service offerings. As a result, we believe we have acquired the best entrepreneurial leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, which is the heartbeat of Quanta Services and the key to our ongoing success.
The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build the company with a comprehensive breadth of self perform the infrastructure solutions that we believe is unmatched in our industry. More than ever before, our customers are seeking comprehensive solutions, safe project execution and cost certainty. With our scope and scale, industry-leading safety record, consisted project performance as well as the largest specialized workforce in our industry, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers.
Another important differentiator is that we have significantly enhanced our engineering and project management capabilities to capitalize on market trends in our industry that we believe that are shifting toward and engineering, procurement and construction or EPC model. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, in addition to our operational capabilities, give our customers the confidence that we can support their expanding needs.
As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, our blueprint for success is threefold. First, we must continue to exceed customer expectations in our core business, delivering projects safety, on-time and on budget. Second, we intend to leverage our core business to expand in the complementary adjacent service lines and selectively expand into new geographies. This broadens the solutions we can offer our customers, provides growth opportunities and achieves operational diversity. And third, we expect to continue to be opportunistic and explore new service lines where we can acquire leadership position and grow shareholder value over the long term. Both organic initiatives and our acquisition program will continue to play an important role in achieving our long-term strategic growth objectives.
Now I'd like to provide some near- and longer-term color on our end markets and our segment expectations for this year. Last year was challenging for electric power segment, and we expect some of those market headwinds to carry over into 2016. As a result, we expect electric power segment revenues may decline by low single digits in 2016 versus 2015. We will anticipate continued growth in subtransmission and distribution work this year. We expect our volume of large transmission revenues to decline in 2016, particularly compared to the first half of 2015 as large project activity was fairly robust at that time. However, we believe large transmission project delays due to regulatory and permitting headwinds are temporary and that growth could resume in the second half of 2016, although timing is uncertain. That said, we continue to have a positive multiyear outlook for the large transmission market based on the projects we have on backlog as well as future opportunities we're aware of and pursuing today.
With the exception of 2015, our electric segment operating income margins have exceeded 10% in every year since 2008. Our 2016 guidance contemplates a range between 8% and 9% to reflect the current market challenges. 
We remain focused on returning this segment to historical operating income margin levels of at least 10%. We are a complex fluid environment where some of our markets are growing at record levels while others are going through challenges. We are proactively addressing these challenges by adjusting our cost structure, where appropriate, by making headcount reductions and by shifting equipment and facility strategies to adjust to the current market environment. This management team is committed to returning margins to historic levels, however, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities. We remain ready to capitalize on the larger, more complex transmission opportunities that we are pursuing.
That said, the end market drivers that underpin our positive multiyear outlook remain firmly in place. The North America power grid continues to age and reliability challenges continue to increase despite the increased capital deployed into transmission and distribution upgrades during this decade.
To that end, the C3 Group and independent energy infrastructure and utility research organization estimates that $25 billion to $30 billion will be spent on transmission annually in North America through 2020. 
Despite the Supreme Court's recent ruling to stay the EPA's clean power plant, the North America power grid generation mix continues to shift away from coal to more natural gas and renewables and new technologies are being deployed, creating a more advanced power grid, all of which require grid expansions and enhancements. As a result, many of our key customers have robust capital programs under way focused on upgrading and expanding transmission and distribution infrastructure in the coming years.
Another longer-term driver of electric transmission is FERC Order 1000. Though we did not expect the project delays resulting from our customers adaptation to this newer regulation, we believe this is a short-term dynamic and expect FERC Order 1000 to drive significant, incremental electrical transmission investment in the future. We believe some of FERC Order 1000 transmission projects could be larger in scope and scale than what the industry has experienced over the past several years. As we have stated in the past, we do not believe these programs will move to construction in a meaningful way until at least 2017.
However, we have a strong base of large transmission projects in our backlog. The combined aggregate contract value of the Labrador Island Link HVdc Transmission Project and the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project alone is approximately $1.5 billion. At year-end, the Labrador Island Link HVdc Transmission Project was approximately 22% complete, and the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project isn't expected to start construction until 2017 and should finish in 2019. We also have numerous strategic alliances with several customers that have robust multiyear electric transmission investment programs.
We believe our oil and gas segment outlook is also promising, as momentum continues to build driven primarily by mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. The mainline market is very -- is a very active environment, and we expect significant mainline construction activity this year. So far in the first quarter, we have either signed contracts or in the final stages of negotiations on approximately $400 million of additional mainline projects. We currently have 2 mainline projects both in Canada that commenced construction late in the fourth quarter, and we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin construction over the next several quarters. We expect most of the mainline activity over the next several years will be related to natural gas pipeline projects, driven primarily by coal-to-gas, power generation switching and increasing demand from commercial and residential customers due to the low price an abundance of natural gas. The natural gas mainline programs fall into FERC jurisdiction and therefore, many have had fewer state permitting issues and approval delays.
We have observed permitting delays on several oil mainline projects. We recently had 1 project delayed indefinitely due to state permitting issues, and we have subsequently removed this project from our year-end backlog. While an extended period of low oil prices could create challenges to mainline pipe projects, it is important to note that the delays we are seeing for oil mainline projects are predominantly due to extended state approval processes and not low oil prices.
We continue to track billions of dollars of additional mainline pipe projects, and we now expect more project activity in 2017 and 2018 than we did previously. We are working with several key customers to ensure that they have adequate resources to accomplish their capital program objectives, and we'll remain disciplined on pricing and contract terms.
With respect to other key services we provide in the oil and gas infrastructure services segment, pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration regulations should continue to drive opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continued to accelerated. Many of our customers are seeking expanded service offerings where we can provide program management and construction capabilities over a larger replacement programs. We have expanded our customer footprint in both Canada and the United States because of this and expect growth opportunities to continue for the next several years.
We continue to expect challenges in areas of our business that are sensitive to the current low oil price environment, primarily in Australia, the Canadian oil sands and our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations. That said, we expect any incremental softness in these areas to be more than offset by the growth in mainline revenues this year and beyond.
As a result of these growth opportunities, we believe our oil and gas segment revenues can grow in the low to mid-teens range of this year. Margins in our oil and gas segment have improved each year since 2007, with the exception of 2015. On our past conference calls, we have communicated you that the proper complement of mainline pipe work and solid execution, we believe this segment should operate in the 9% to 12% operating income range, which we still believe to be true. However, our 2016 guidance reflects an operating income margin range for this segment of 5.5% to 7%. Several factors led us to project margins of below the 9% operating margin range for this segment this year. 
First, the volume of midstream gathering work is forecasted to be down significantly this year due to reduced rig count in North America, a prolonged oil price environment and bottlenecks with moving natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales due to the lack of takeaway infrastructure are the primary cause. Midstream gathering work has been a recurring revenue base that augmented our mainline pipe workforce while mainline pipe activities were at low levels. Until our mainline pipe project is ramped into construction, we forecast that near-term segment margins could be pressured. 
Second, if mainline projects ramp-up is expected this year, we will mobilize multiple spreads consisting of several thousand people and the complement of equipment in a very short period of time. We're being prudent with our margin expectations until these projects transitioned and are in full construction. 
Finally, while we expect our operations that are impacted by the low price of oil to be profitable this year, it will be difficult for these businesses to generate margins higher than mid-single digits, which will affect our overall segment margins.
We're aggressively taking steps to rightsize these operations to operate profitably in the current environment, which will be an ongoing process. As a result, we anticipate taking a $3 million to $4 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, which we have included in our 2016 guidance.
In summary, while we are experienced -- while we have experienced challenges in 2015, we expect profitable growth in 2016 largely from contributions from mainline pipe construction and the non-reoccurrence of the meaningful project losses we have in 2015. We believe the current dynamics impacting the electric power segment are short term, and we have significant projects and backlog and are also working with several customers on future large transmission project opportunities that will play out over a multiyear period.
During my 17 years here at Quanta, I have been through several market down cycles. And in each situation, whether the telecom meltdown in 2001 and 2002 or the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, Quanta has emerged a stronger, better company with improved competitive position within the industry. I expect the same result as we move through our current industry challenges.
We continue to execute on strategies that position Quanta for both near- and long-term growth, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver the customer-driven solutions that have made us the industry leader.
As we close out 2015 with this call, I want to thank our employees who I believe are the very best in the industry and are the primary reason we consistently differentiate ourselves from our competitors in an ever-changing market environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our financial results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 mi",2814,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 million or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $60.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as presented in today's press release was $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by approximately $0.25 per diluted share of net impairment charges. These charges included asset impairment of $58.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share, primarily associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with lower forecasted oil and gas service revenues for our Gulf of Mexico operations and certain Australian operations due to the extended low commodity price environment. These charges were partially offset by tax benefits of $4.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred asset related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Also net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by $30.3 million net of tax charge or $0.14 per diluted share for a provision for long-term contract receivable associated with chain orders on a 2012 electric power transmission project that were ultimately settled earlier this year.
Net loss attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter 2015 was $5.1 million or a $0.03 loss per diluted share. This compares to net income attributable to common stock of $66.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the same quarter last year is primarily due to a decrease in revenues from a large electric transmission and mainline projects, which were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending and delays from project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues. In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% [ph] when compared to the fourth quarter 2014 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rate between the quarters.
Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $70 [ph] million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our oil and gas infrastructure segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 11.7% in the fourth quarter 2015 as compared to 15.4% in the fourth quarter 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of the negative impact of lower revenues from mainline and large electric transmission projects, both of which typically carry higher margins than certain other types of projects. 
Also impacting our gross margin for the quarter was $19.3 million of incremental project losses related to a power plant project in Alaska, which is expected to be completed in mid-2016. These incremental costs on the project were largely due to differences in build requirements versus the original engineering, and we are pursuing specific engineering claims to recover a portion of these costs. However, the benefit of potential recovery on these claims has not yet been reflected in our estimates as of year-end.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this quarter's earnings release were $151.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter 2014. This decrease is primarily due to $6 million in lower salaries and benefits costs associated with the level of operations in 2015, partially offset by $3.5 million in higher professional fees. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this release as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the fourth quarter 2015 as compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues and its negative impact on the absorption of consolidated overhead costs.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power segment revenues were $1.29 billion, reflecting a decrease of $72.6 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.3%. Lower revenues were a result of reduced customer spending and delays in projects due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted revenues in this segment by approximately $31 million for the fourth quarter 2015. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies as well as increased activity from smaller transmission and distribution in projects.
Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased slightly to 6.8% in the fourth quarter 2015 as compared to 7.4% in last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in margin was primarily due to the previously mentioned incremental loss recorded during the quarter on a power plant project, lower revenues from higher-margin large electric transmission projects as well as a $6.6 million property and equipment impairment charge related to certain international renewable energy services operations. Although these items negatively impacted the operating items for 4Q '15, for comparative purposes, the fourth quarter 2014 was also impacted by the previously mentioned charge to a provision for long-term contract receivable.
As of December 31, 2015, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased 2.3% and total backlog increased 1.2% when compared to September 30, 2015. The decrease in 12-month backlog is primarily due to burn on existing projects along with the negative impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total backlog increased due to the inclusion of 2 Latin American telecom concession awards as well as the estimated contribution to total backlog for the renewal of certain MSAs, slightly offset by the impact of certain foreign currency exchange rates.
Oil and Gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $55.8 million or 8.4% to $607.8 million in 4Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of when large mainline projects moved to construction as well as reduced demand for certain of our oil and gas services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. Also changes in foreign currency translation rates negatively impacted revenues contributed by international operations in this segment by approximately $19 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were revenue contributions of approximately $45 million from acquired companies as well as increased revenues from distribution services.
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 3.9% in 4Q '15 from 8.1% in 4Q '14. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decline in mainline revenues, which typically yield higher margins as well as lower margins on those mainline projects actually under construction due to typical project variability. Also contributing to this decrease was lower demand for services associated with certain operations as a result of lower oil prices and permitting delays, which negatively impacted the segment's ability to cover fixed costs.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas infrastructure services segment decreased by $184.7 million or 8.9% and total backlog decreased $336.9 million or 9.9% when compared to September 30, 2015. These decreases were due to the removal of a mainline project from year-end backlog that Jim referenced in his prepared comments, burn on existing contracts as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between the period.
Corporate and unallocated costs increased $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 4Q '14 as the result of the $51.9 million charge associated with the previously mentioned goodwill and intangible asset impairments.
Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, provided approximately $618.2 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $183.8 million, resulting in approximately $434.4 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was partially due to decreased working capital requirements associated with the decrease in a number of large electric transmission jobs ramping up this year as compared to last year, the receipt of approximately $87 million in a project prepayment for a project with production beginning in 2015 and the receipt of a $65 million cash payment for the Sunrise Powerlink project receivable in the first quarter of 2015.
Also cash flows related to discontinued operations for the fourth quarter 2015 were negatively impacted by a payment of approximately $134 million associated with taxes payable from the gain on sale of Sinise's. DSOs were 75 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 85 days at September 30, 2015, and 84 days at December 31, 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the impact at December 31, 2015, of the inclusion of the $87 million project prepayment discussed previously and strong collections in the fourth quarter 2015. DSOs at December 31, 2014, were negatively impacted by the inclusion of a $65 million Sunrise Powerlink project receivable and the impact of acquisition working capital balances late in the fourth quarter 2014, for which there were no material corresponding fourth quarter revenues.
Investing cash flows during the fourth quarter 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $9 million, net of cash acquired related to the closing of 1 acquisition in Canada during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the fourth quarter 2015 came from net [indiscernible] of $131.3 million [ph] under our credit facility, partially used to fund the repurchase of 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $76.8 million. 
To recap our share repurchase activity, we repurchased a total of 59.3 million shares for a value of approximately $1.46 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. We've also paid $150 million under an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, the ASR, entered into on August 10, 2015, for shares expected to be delivered upon final settlement of the ASR in April of this year.
At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $128.8 million in cash. At the end of the year, we had about $307 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $466.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. As previously announced, we increased our credit facility in December 2015 to $1.81 billion and extended maturity to December 2020. Favorable market conditions allowed us to maintain a competitive pricing and structure, including increased capacity to fund operations outside of the U.S. As such, we opportunistically amended the credit facility with the increasing commitments providing for approximately $1.16 billion of liquidity as of December 31, 2015. 
Turning to guidance. Throughout 2015, we have evaluated whether or not providing quarterly earnings guidance is beneficial given the short-term volatility that can occur due to variability in project timing and other impact factors that impact earnings from period to period. As we move into 2016, we will only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year.
For the year ended 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplate electric power segment revenues ranging from the decline of around 5% at the low end of our guidance to year-over-year revenues in the segment remaining flat at the high end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in oil and gas segments. As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to revenues and margins. We would expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter being the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margin in the fourth quarter fall somewhere between the second and third quarter.
Of note, we expert a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. The slowing of the Canadian economy, reduced activity in the Canadian oil sand and the timing of project starts has reduced the seasonal offsets or flattening that Canadian revenues have provided in the first and second quarter over the past 2 [ph] years. This, coupled with lower large electric transmission and mainline project revenues compared to the first quarter of last year caused [ph] us to estimate that our first quarter revenues could potentially decline up to 10%.
On the other hand, we expect a sizable ramp in revenues in the third quarter as we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with electric power somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas margins between 5.5% and 7%. Jim commented in his prepared remarks as to the primary factors affecting these margin estimates. 
In addition, largely due to ramp in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas do largely due to the timing of mainline project starts. Our markets remain in a fluid environment with some areas of our business growing and others having challenges. As it relates to recent actions taken by management deeper margins, we've made headcount adjustments at our corporate office as well at various operating units as further evidence by the restructuring costs associated by our offshore operations expected in the first quarter; a shutdown of our Middle East operations, which led to the fourth quarter tax benefit; as well as the rightsizing of our international operations, which included the impairment of certain renewable energy assets in the fourth quarter. These are just a few examples of our focus on adjusting the business to return margins to our target levels.
We would estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%.
Also our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause our actual financial results to differ from guidance.
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended 2016, we're assuming 156.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our estimates include a projected reduction of approximately 10 million shares in April of 2016, which is the estimated settlement date of the ASR program and when final settlement of the required shares to be delivered is anticipated to take place. There are many factors that can influence our estimate of the final number of shares anticipated to be delivered under the ASR program, including [indiscernible] and further fluctuations in the stock price.
We currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50 and anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.58 and $1.78.
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
Despite the challenges we experienced in 2015, we have several significant accomplishments that financially position us well for the future. The sale of our fiber optic licensing operations unlocked significant values and generate significant after-tax proceeds. Along with these proceeds, we utilize a record free cash flow and availability under our credit facility to repurchase nearly $1.5 billion for our common stock in 2015 and an additional $150 million has been paid under the ASR, which effectively recapitalized our balance sheet and improved our cost of capital.
In addition, we increased the capacity and extended maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, increasing liquidity to assist in achieving strategic objectives the we believe will continue to generate shareholder value. We closed 11 acquisitions during 2015 for an aggregate consideration consisting of $110.4 million in cash and $10.1 million in securities, which enhanced our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service capabilities. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and be positioned for continued internal growth and to execute on strategic initiatives.
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investment in the repurchase of Quanta stock.
This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?"

I do think the problem will take care of itself once we start building takeaway capacity, but we are expecting levels of gathering to be down significantly this year compared to what we've seen the past few years. I would guess probably half the volume, but the segment revenue should still grow because we do think our LBC markets and our mainline markets will grow and make up for that downturn. But it does create some volatility in earnings in particular when you haven't ramped up significantly in mainline. We were using that was a good staple baseline of work that we were doing on gathering that was recurring revenue year-round that's now at a lower level.

When we do have a full complement of mainline going in the second -- particularly in the third quarter, we should see us moving into that 9% to 12% range if we execute. But for the full year, we expect it to be a drag, primarily because of the lack of gathering work that we've done over the last several years and also, we've got about segment -- about 15% of our business that has been impacted directly by oil prices where we have operations that will be generating -- we expect them to generate positive margins but certainly, nowhere near that 9% to 12% range in the areas impacted by oil and gas. So when you look at the entire segment and the dynamics that are occurring today, we feel like it will be challenging to be in that 9% range. Now -- but that is our expectation long term and we're going to continue to make adjustments.

I will start the call with the strategic and operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
Our fourth quarter results, excluding unusual financial items, met our expectations, which I believe sets a positive tempo as we close out what was a challenging year for the company and the overall industry. Many of the challenges we faced in 2015 resulted from factors outside of our control such as the collapse in oil prices and in particular, its effect on the Canadian economy, several severe weather events, project delays due to a challenging permitting environment and a sudden shift in small transmission market dynamics, all of which impacted our top line, margins and profitability.
However, there were things we should have done better. For example, the unusual occurrence of a significant project loss we incurred on the combined cycle gas power plant we're building in Alaska. That said, we booked significant mainline pipe backlog in 2015 and expect additional mainline awards this year, which should be a catalyst for profitable growth for Quanta in 2016.
As we transition from a challenging 2015 into '16, I believe it is an appropriate time to review our strategies for long-term growth and competitive differentiation as well as discuss the near and longer-term drivers of the markets we serve. Though our end markets are experiencing some near-term challenges that create uncertainty, we believe uncertainty creates opportunity, and we are actively pursuing strategic initiatives that we believe will lay the groundwork for success in the upcoming years.
A unique but critical driver of Quanta's success is the decentralized and entrepreneurial business model that Quanta embraces. Since Quanta's IPO in 1998, we have completed nearly 200 acquisitions through which we acquired some of the best operators in our industries and strategically expanded into different geographies and service offerings. As a result, we believe we have acquired the best entrepreneurial leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, which is the heartbeat of Quanta Services and the key to our ongoing success.
The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build the company with a comprehensive breadth of self-perform infrastructure solutions that we believe is unmatched in our industry. More than ever before, our customers are seeking comprehensive solutions, safe project execution and cost certainty. With our scope and scale, industry-leading safety record, consistent project performance as well as the largest specialized workforce in our industry, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers.
Another important differentiator is that we have significantly enhanced our engineering and project management capabilities to capitalize on market trends in our industry that we believe are shifting toward and engineering, procurement and construction or EPC model. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, in addition to our operational capabilities, give our customers the confidence that we can support their expanding needs.
As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, our blueprint for success is threefold. First, we must continue to exceed customer expectations in our core business, delivering projects safely, on-time and on budget. Second, we intend to leverage our core business to expand in the complementary adjacent service lines and selectively expand into new geographies. This broadens the solutions we can offer our customers, provides growth opportunities and achieves operational diversity. And third, we expect to continue to be opportunistic and explore new service lines where we can acquire leadership position and grow shareholder value over the long term. Both organic initiatives and our acquisition program will continue to play an important role in achieving our long-term strategic growth objectives.
Now I'd like to provide some near- and longer-term color on our end markets and our segment expectations for this year. Last year was challenging for our electric power segment, and we expect some of those market headwinds to carry over into 2016. As a result, we expect electric power segment revenues may decline by low single digits in 2016 versus 2015. We will anticipate continued growth in sub-transmission and distribution work this year. We expect our volume of large transmission revenues to decline in 2016, particularly compared to the first half of 2015 as large project activity was fairly robust at that time. However, we believe large transmission project delays due to regulatory and permitting headwinds are temporary and that growth could resume in the second half of 2016, although timing is uncertain. That said, we continue to have a positive multiyear outlook for the large transmission market based on the projects we have in backlog as well as future opportunities we're aware of and pursuing today.
With the exception of 2015, our electric segment operating income margins have exceeded 10% in every year since 2008. Our 2016 guidance contemplates a range between 8% and 9% to reflect the current market challenges. 
We remain focused on returning this segment to historical operating income margin levels of at least 10%. We are a complex fluid environment where some of our markets are growing at record levels while others are going through challenges. We are proactively addressing these challenges by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, by making headcount reductions and by shifting equipment and facility strategies to adjust to the current market environment. This management team is committed to returning margins to historical levels, however, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities. We remain ready to capitalize on the larger, more complex transmission opportunities that we are pursuing.
That said, the end market drivers that underpin our positive multiyear outlook remain firmly in place. The North America power grid continues to age and reliability challenges continue to increase despite the increased capital deployed into transmission and distribution upgrades during this decade.
To that end, the C3 Group, an independent energy infrastructure and utility research organization estimates that $25 billion to $30 billion will be spent on transmission annually in North America through 2020. 
Despite the Supreme Court's recent ruling to stay the EPA's clean power plant, the North America power grid generation mix continues to shift away from coal to more natural gas and renewables and new technologies are being deployed, creating a more advanced power grid, all of which require grid expansions and enhancements. As a result, many of our key customers have robust capital programs under way focused on upgrading and expanding transmission and distribution infrastructure in the coming years.
Another longer-term driver of electric transmission is FERC Order 1000. Though we did not expect the project delays resulting from our customers adaptation to this newer regulation, we believe this is a short-term dynamic and expect FERC Order 1000 to drive significant, incremental electric transmission investment in the future. We believe some of FERC Order 1000 transmission projects could be larger in scope and scale than what the industry has experienced over the past several years. But as we have stated in the past, we do not believe these programs will move to construction in a meaningful way until at least 2017.
However, we have a strong base of large transmission projects in our backlog. The combined aggregate contract value of the Labrador Island Link HVdc Transmission Project and the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project alone is approximately $1.5 billion. At year-end, the Labrador Island Link HVdc Transmission Project was approximately 22% complete, and the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project isn't expected to start construction until 2017 and should finish in 2019. We also have numerous strategic alliances with several customers that have robust multiyear electric transmission investment programs.
We believe our oil and gas segment outlook is also promising, as momentum continues to build driven primarily by mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. The mainline market is very -- is a very active environment, and we expect significant mainline construction activity this year. So far in the first quarter, we have either signed contracts or in the final stages of negotiations on approximately $400 million of additional mainline projects. We currently have 2 mainline projects both in Canada that commenced construction late in the fourth quarter, and we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin construction over the next several quarters. We expect most of the mainline activity over the next several years will be related to natural gas pipeline projects, driven primarily by coal-to-gas, power generation switching and increasing demand from commercial and residential customers due to the low price and abundance of natural gas. The natural gas mainline programs fall into FERC jurisdiction and therefore, many have had fewer state permitting issues and approval delays.
We have observed permitting delays on several oil mainline projects. We recently had 1 project delayed indefinitely due to state permitting issues, and we have subsequently removed this project from our year-end backlog. While an extended period of low oil prices could create challenges to mainline pipe projects, it is important to note that the delays we are seeing for oil mainline projects are predominantly due to extended state approval processes and not low oil prices.
We continue to track billions of dollars of additional mainline pipe projects, and we now expect more project activity in 2017 and 2018 than we did previously. We are working with several key customers to ensure that they have adequate resources to accomplish their capital program objectives, and we will remain disciplined on pricing and contract terms.
With respect to other key services we provide in the oil and gas infrastructure services segment, pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration regulations should continue to drive opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerated. Many of our customers are seeking expanded service offerings where we can provide program management and construction capabilities over a larger replacement programs. We have expanded our customer footprint in both Canada and the United States because of this and expect growth opportunities to continue for the next several years.
We continue to expect challenges in areas of our business that are sensitive to the current low oil price environment, primarily in Australia, the Canadian oil sands and our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations. That said, we expect any incremental softness in these areas to be more than offset by the growth in mainline revenues this year and beyond.
As a result of these growth opportunities, we believe our oil and gas segment revenues can grow in the low to mid-teens range this year. Margins in our oil and gas segment have improved each year since 2007, with the exception of 2015. On our past conference calls, we have communicated to you that the proper complement of mainline pipe work and solid execution, we believe this segment should operate in the 9% to 12% operating income range, which we still believe to be true. However, our 2016 guidance reflects an operating income margin range for this segment of 5.5% to 7%. Several factors led us to project margins of below the 9% operating range for this segment this year. 
First, the volume of midstream gathering work is forecasted to be down significantly this year due to reduced rig count in North America, a prolonged oil price environment and bottlenecks with moving natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales due to the lack of takeaway infrastructure are the primary cause. Midstream gathering work has been a recurring revenue base that augmented our mainline pipe workforce while mainline activities were at low levels. Until our mainline pipe project is ramped into construction, we forecast that near-term segment margins could be pressured. 
Second, if mainline projects ramp up as expected this year, we will mobilize multiple spreads consisting of several thousand people and the complement of equipment in a very short period of time. We're being prudent with our margin expectations until these projects transitioned and are in full construction. 
Finally, while we expect our operations that are impacted by the low price of oil to be profitable this year, it will be difficult for these businesses to generate margins higher than mid-single digits, which will affect our overall segment margins.
We're aggressively taking steps to rightsize these operations to operate profitably in the current environment, which will be an ongoing process. As a result, we anticipate taking a $3 million to $4 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, which we have included in our 2016 guidance.
In summary, while we are experienced -- while we have experienced challenges in 2015, we expect profitable growth in 2016 largely from contributions from mainline pipe construction and the non-reoccurrence of the meaningful project losses we had in 2015. We believe the current dynamics impacting the electric power segment are short term, and we have significant projects in backlog and are also working with several customers on future large transmission project opportunities that will play out over a multiyear period.
During my 17 years here at Quanta, I have been through several market down cycles. And in each situation, whether the telecom meltdown in 2001 and 2002 or the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, Quanta has emerged a stronger, better company with improved competitive position within the industry. I expect the same result as we move through our current industry challenges.
We continue to execute on strategies that position Quanta for both near- and long-term growth, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver the customer-driven solutions that have made us the industry leader.
As we close out 2015 with this call, I want to thank our employees who I believe are the very best in the industry, and are the primary reason we consistently differentiate ourselves from our competitors in an ever-changing market environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our financial results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 mi",2828,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 million or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $60.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as presented in today's press release was $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by approximately $0.25 per diluted share of net impairment charges. These charges included asset impairment of $58.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share, primarily associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with lower forecasted oil and gas service revenues for our Gulf of Mexico operations and certain Australian operations due to the extended low commodity price environment. These charges were partially offset by tax benefits of $4.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Also net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by $30.3 million net of tax charge or $0.14 per diluted share for a provision for long-term contract receivable associated with chain orders on a 2012 electric power transmission project that were ultimately settled earlier this year.
Net loss attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter 2015 was $5.1 million or a $0.03 loss per diluted share. This compares to net income attributable to common stock of $66.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the same quarter of last year is primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our large electric transmission and mainline projects, which were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending and delays in project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues. In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rate between the quarters.
Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $70 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our oil and gas infrastructure segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 15.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of the negative impact of lower revenues from mainline and large electric transmission projects, both of which typically carry higher margins than certain other types of projects. 
Also impacting our gross margin for the quarter was $19.3 million of incremental project losses related to a power plant project in Alaska, which is expected to be completed in mid-2016. These incremental costs on the project were largely due to differences in build requirements versus the original engineering, and we are pursuing specific engineering claims to recover a portion of these costs. However, the benefit of potential recovery on these claims has not yet been reflected in our estimates as of year-end.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this quarter's earnings release were $151.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease is primarily due to $6 million in lower salaries and benefits costs associated with the level of operations in 2015, partially offset by $3.5 million in higher professional fees. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this release as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues and its negative impact on the absorption of consolidated overhead costs.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power segment revenues were $1.29 billion, reflecting a decrease of $72.6 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.3%. Lower revenues were a result of reduced customer spending and delays in projects due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted revenues in this segment by approximately $31 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies as well as increased activity from smaller transmission and distribution projects.
Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased slightly to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.4% in last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in margin was primarily due to the previously mentioned incremental loss recorded during the quarter on the power plant project, lower revenues from higher-margin large electric transmission projects as well as a $6.6 million property and equipment impairment charge related to certain international renewable energy services operations. Although these items negatively impacted the operating margins for 4Q '15, for comparative purposes, the fourth quarter of 2014 was also impacted by the previously mentioned charge to a provision for long-term contract receivable.
As of December 31, 2015, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased 2.3% and total backlog increased 1.2% when compared to September 30, 2015. The decrease in 12-month backlog is primarily due to burn on existing projects along with the negative impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total backlog increased due to the inclusion of 2 Latin American telecom concession awards as well as the estimated contribution to total backlog for the renewal of certain MSAs, slightly offset by the impact of certain foreign currency exchange rates.
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $55.8 million or 8.4% to $607.8 million in 4Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of when large mainline projects moved to construction as well as reduced demand for certain of our oil and gas services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. Also changes in foreign currency translation rates negatively impacted revenues contributed by international operations in this segment by approximately $19 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were revenue contributions of approximately $45 million from acquired companies as well as increased revenues from distribution services.
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 3.9% in 4Q '15 from 8.1% in 4Q '14. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decline in mainline revenues, which typically yield higher margins as well as lower margins on those mainline projects actually under construction due to typical project variability. Also contributing to this decrease was lower demand for services associated with certain operations as a result of lower oil prices and permitting delays, which negatively impacted the segment's ability to cover fixed costs.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas infrastructure services segment decreased by $184.7 million or 8.9% and total backlog decreased $336.9 million or 9.9% when compared to September 30, 2015. These decreases were due to the removal of a mainline project from year-end backlog that Jim referenced in his prepared comments, burn on existing contracts as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.
Corporate and unallocated costs increased $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 4Q '14 as the result of the $51.9 million charge associated with the previously mentioned goodwill and intangible asset impairments.
Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, provided approximately $618.2 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $183.8 million, resulting in approximately $434.4 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was partially due to decreased working capital requirements associated with the decrease in the number of large electric transmission jobs ramping up this year as compared to last year, the receipt of approximately $87 million in a project prepayment for a project with production beginning in 2015 and the receipt of a $65 million cash payment for the Sunrise Powerlink project receivable in the first quarter of 2015.
Also cash flows related to discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by a payment of approximately $134 million associated with taxes payable from the gain on sale of Sunesys. DSOs were 75 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 85 days at September 30, 2015, and 84 days at December 31, 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the impact at December 31, 2015, of the inclusion of the $87 million project prepayment discussed previously and strong collections in the fourth quarter of 2015. DSOs at December 31, 2014, were negatively impacted by the inclusion of the $65 million Sunrise Powerlink project receivable and the impact of acquisition working capital balances late in the fourth quarter 2014, for which there were no material corresponding fourth quarter revenues.
Investing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $9 million, net of cash acquired related to the closing of 1 acquisition in Canada during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 came from net borrowings of $131.3 billion under our credit facility, partially used to fund the repurchase of 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $76.8 million. 
To recap our share repurchase activity, we repurchased a total of 59.3 million shares for a value of approximately $1.46 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. We've also paid $150 million under an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, the ASR, entered into on August 10, 2015, for shares expected to be delivered upon final settlement of the ASR in April of this year.
At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $128.8 million in cash. At the end of the year, we had about $307 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $466.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. As previously announced, we increased our credit facility in December 2015 to $1.81 billion and extended maturity to December 2020. Favorable market conditions allowed us to maintain a competitive pricing and structure, including increased capacity to fund operations outside of the U.S. As such, we opportunistically amended the credit facility with the increasing commitments providing for approximately $1.16 billion of liquidity as of December 31, 2015. 
Turning to guidance. Throughout 2015, we have evaluated whether or not providing quarterly earnings guidance is beneficial given the short-term volatility that can occur due to the variability in project timing and other impact factors that impact earnings from period to period. As we move into 2016, we will only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year.
For the year ended 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplate electric power segment revenues ranging from the decline of around 5% at the low end of our guidance to year-over-year revenues in the segment remaining flat at the high end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in oil and gas segment. As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to revenues and margins. We would expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter being the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter fall somewhere between the second and third quarter.
Of note, we expert a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. The slowing of the Canadian economy, reduced activity in the Canadian oil sand and the timing of project starts has reduced the seasonal offsets or flattening that Canadian revenues had provided in the first and second quarter over the past few years. This, coupled with lower large electric transmission and mainline project revenues compared to the first quarter of last year causes us to estimate that our first quarter revenues could potentially decline up to 10%.
On the other hand, we expect a sizable ramp in revenues in the third quarter as we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with electric power somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas margins between 5.5% and 7%. Jim commented in his prepared remarks as to the primary factors affecting these margin estimates. 
In addition, largely due to ramp in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas due largely due to the timing of mainline project starts. Our markets remain in a fluid environment with some areas of our business growing and others having challenges. As it relates to recent actions taken by management to improve margins, we've made headcount adjustments at our corporate office as well at various operating units as further evidence by the restructuring costs associated with our offshore operations expected in the first quarter; a shutdown of our Middle East operations, which led to the fourth quarter tax benefit; as well as the rightsizing of our international operations, which included the impairment of certain renewable energy assets in the fourth quarter. These are just a few examples of our focus on adjusting the business to return margins to our target levels.
We would estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%.
Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange environment. Continuing movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause the actual financial results to differ from guidance.
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended 2016, we're assuming 156.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our estimates include a projected reduction of approximately 10 million shares in April of 2016, which is the estimated settlement date of the ASR program and when final settlement of the required shares to be delivered is anticipated to take place. There are many factors that can influence our estimate of the final number of shares anticipated to be delivered under the ASR program, including an option and further fluctuations in the stock price.
We currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50 and anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.58 and $1.78.
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
Despite the challenges we experienced in 2015, we had several significant accomplishments that financially position us well for the future. The sale of our fiber optic licensing operations unlocked significant values and generate significant after-tax proceeds. Along with these proceeds, we utilize a record free cash flow and availability under our credit facility to repurchase nearly $1.5 billion for our common stock in 2015 and an additional $150 million has been paid under the ASR, which effectively recapitalized our balance sheet and improved our cost of capital.
In addition, we increased the capacity and extended the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, increasing liquidity to assist that in achieving strategic objectives that we believe will continue to generate shareholder value. We closed 11 acquisitions during 2015 for an aggregate consideration consisting of $110.4 million in cash and $10.1 million in securities, which enhanced our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service capabilities. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and be positioned for continued internal growth and to execute on strategic initiatives.
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.

There have been fewer wells being drilled because that they can't get the gas out. And so subsequently, there's less gathering work to be done. I do think that problem will take care of itself once we start building takeaway capacity, but we are expecting levels of gathering to be down significantly this year compared to what we've seen in the past few years. I would guess probably half the volume, but the segment revenue should still grow because we do think our LBC markets and our mainline markets will grow and make up for that downturn. But it does create some volatility in earnings in particular when you haven't ramped up significantly in mainline. We were using that was a good stable baseline of work that we were doing on gathering that was recurring revenue year-round that's now at a lower level. So it's going to have some impact on margins and so we ramped up on mainline in a meaningful way."

When we do have a full complement of mainline going in the second -- or particularly in the third quarter, we should see us moving into that 9% to 12% range if we execute. But for the full year, we expect it to be a drag, primarily because of the lack of gathering work that we've done over the last several years and also, we've got segment about 15% of our business that has been impacted directly by oil prices where we have operations that will be generating, we expect them to generate positive margins but certainly, nowhere near that 9% to 12% range in the areas impacted by oil and gas. So when you look at the entire segment and the dynamics that are occurring today, we feel like it will be challenging to be in that 9% range. Now -- but that is our expectation long term and we're going to continue to make adjustments.

Welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with a strategic and operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief",2341,"Thank you, Kip, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with a strategic and operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
Our fourth quarter results, excluding unusual financial items, met our expectations, which I believe sets a positive tempo as we close out what was a challenging year for the company and the overall industry. Many of the challenges we faced in 2015 resulted from factors outside of our control such as the collapse in oil prices and in particular, its effect on the Canadian economy, several severe weather events, project delays due to a challenging permitting environment and a sudden shift in small transmission market dynamics, all of which impacted our top line, margins and profitability.
However, there were things we should have done better. For example, the unusual occurrence of a significant project loss we incurred on the combined cycle gas power plant we're building in Alaska. That said, we booked significant mainline pipe backlog in 2015 and expect additional mainline awards this year, which should be a catalyst for profitable growth for Quanta in 2016.
As we transition from a challenging 2015 into '16, I believe it is an appropriate time to review our strategies for long-term growth and competitive differentiation as well as discuss the near and longer-term drivers of the markets we serve. Though our end markets are experiencing some near-term challenges that create uncertainty, we believe uncertainty creates opportunity, and we are actively pursuing strategic initiatives that we believe will lay the groundwork for success in the upcoming years.
A unique but critical driver of Quanta's success is the decentralized and entrepreneurial business model that Quanta embraces. Since Quanta's IPO in 1998, we have completed nearly 200 acquisitions through which we acquired some of the best operators in our industries and strategically expanded into different geographies and service offerings. As a result, we believe we have acquired the best entrepreneurial leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, which is the heartbeat of Quanta Services and the key to our ongoing success.
The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a company with a comprehensive breadth of self-perform infrastructure solutions that we believe is unmatched in our industry. More than ever before, our customers are seeking comprehensive solutions, safe project execution and cost certainty. With our scope and scale, industry-leading safety record, consistent project performance as well as the largest specialized workforce in our industry, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers.
Another important differentiator is that we have significantly enhanced our engineering and project management capabilities to capitalize on market trends in our industry that we believe are shifting toward an engineering, procurement and construction or EPC model. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, in addition to our operational capabilities, gives our customers the confidence that we can support their expanding needs.
As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, our blueprint for success is threefold. First, we must continue to exceed customer expectations in our core business, delivering projects safely, on-time and on budget. Second, we intend to leverage our core business to expand into complementary adjacent service lines and selectively expand into new geographies. This broadens the solutions we can offer our customers, provides growth opportunities and achieves operational diversity. And third, we expect to continue to be opportunistic and explore new service lines where we can acquire a leadership position and grow shareholder value over the long term. Both organic initiatives and our acquisition program will continue to play an important role in achieving our long-term strategic growth objectives.
Now I'd like to provide some near- and longer-term color on our end markets and our segment expectations for this year. Last year was challenging for our electric power segment, and we expect some of those market headwinds to carry over into 2016. As a result, we expect electric power segment revenues may decline by low single digits in 2016 versus 2015. We will anticipate continued growth in sub-transmission and distribution work this year. We expect our volume of large transmission revenues to decline in 2016, particularly compared to the first half of 2015 as large project activity was fairly robust at that time. However, we believe large transmission project delays due to regulatory and permitting headwinds are temporary and that growth could resume in the second half of 2016, although timing is uncertain. That said, we continue to have a positive multiyear outlook for the large transmission market based on the projects we have in backlog as well as future opportunities we're aware of and pursuing today.
With the exception of 2015, our electric segment operating income margins have exceeded 10% in every year since 2008. Our 2016 guidance contemplates a range between 8% and 9% to reflect the current market challenges. 
We remain focused on returning this segment to historical operating income margin levels of at least 10%. We are in a complex fluid environment where some of our markets are growing at record levels while others are going through challenges. We are proactively addressing these challenges by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, by making headcount reductions and by shifting equipment and facility strategies to adjust to the current market environment. This management team is committed to returning margins to historical levels, however, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities. We remain ready to capitalize on the larger, more complex transmission opportunities that we are pursuing.
That said, the end market drivers that underpin our positive multiyear outlook remain firmly in place. The North America power grid continues to age and reliability challenges continue to increase despite the increased capital deployed into transmission and distribution upgrades during this decade.
To that end, the C3 Group, an independent energy infrastructure and utility research organization, estimates that $25 billion to $30 billion will be spent on transmission annually in North America through 2020. 
Despite the Supreme Court's recent ruling to stay the EPA's clean power plan, the North America power grid generation mix continues to shift away from coal to more natural gas and renewables and new technologies are being deployed, creating a more advanced power grid, all of which require grid expansions and enhancements. As a result, many of our key customers have robust capital programs under way focused on upgrading and expanding transmission and distribution infrastructure in the coming years.
Another longer-term driver of electric transmission is FERC Order 1000. Though we did not expect the project delays resulting from our customers’ adaptation to this newer regulation, we believe this is a short-term dynamic and expect FERC Order 1000 to drive significant, incremental electric transmission investment in the future. We believe some of FERC Order 1000 transmission projects could be larger in scope and scale than what the industry has experienced over the past several years. But as we have stated in the past, we do not believe these programs will move to construction in a meaningful way until at least 2017.
However, we have a strong base of large transmission projects in our backlog. The combined aggregate contract value of the Labrador Island Link HVdc Transmission Project and the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project alone is approximately $1.5 billion. At year-end, the Labrador Island Link HVdc Transmission Project was approximately 22% complete, and the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project isn't expected to start construction until 2017 and should finish in 2019. We also have numerous strategic alliances with several customers that have robust multiyear electric transmission investment programs.
We believe our oil and gas segment outlook is also promising, as momentum continues to build driven primarily by our mainline and natural gas distribution and Integrity markets. The mainline market is very -- is a very active environment, and we expect significant mainline construction activity this year. So far in the first quarter, we have either signed contracts or are in the final stages of negotiations on approximately $400 million of additional mainline projects. We currently have 2 mainline projects, both in Canada, that commenced construction late in the fourth quarter, and we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin construction over the next several quarters. We expect most of the mainline activity over the next several years will be related to natural gas pipeline projects, driven primarily by coal-to-gas power generation switching and increasing demand from commercial and residential customers due to the low price and abundance of natural gas. The natural gas mainline programs fall under FERC jurisdiction and therefore, many have had fewer state permitting issues and approval delays.
We have observed permitting delays on several oil mainline projects. We recently had 1 project delayed indefinitely due to state permitting issues, and we have subsequently removed this project from our year-end backlog. While an extended period of low oil prices could create challenges to mainline pipe projects, it is important to note that the delays we are seeing for oil mainline projects are predominantly due to extended state approval processes and not low oil prices.
We continue to track billions of dollars of additional mainline pipe projects, and we now expect more project activity in 2017 and 2018 than we did previously. We are working with several key customers to ensure that they have adequate resources to accomplish their capital program objectives, and we will remain disciplined on pricing and contract terms.
With respect to other key services we provide in the oil and gas infrastructure services segment, pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration regulations should continue to drive opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate. Many of our customers are seeking expanded service offerings where we can provide program management and construction capabilities over larger replacement programs. We have expanded our customer footprint in both Canada and the United States because of this and expect growth opportunities to continue for the next several years.
We continue to expect challenges in areas of our business that are sensitive to the current low oil price environment, primarily in Australia, the Canadian oil sands and our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations. That said, we expect any incremental softness in these areas to be more than offset by the growth in mainline revenues this year and beyond.
As a result of these growth opportunities, we believe our oil and gas segment revenues can grow in the low to mid-teens range this year. Margins in our oil and gas segment have improved each year since 2007, with the exception of 2015. On our past conference calls, we have communicated to you that the proper complement of mainline pipe work and solid execution, we believe this segment should operate in the 9% to 12% operating income range, which we still believe to be true. However, our 2016 guidance reflects an operating income margin range for this segment of 5.5% to 7%. Several factors led us to project margins below the 9% operating range for this segment this year. 
First, the volume of midstream gathering work is forecasted to be down significantly this year due to reduced rig count in North America, a prolonged oil price environment and bottlenecks with moving natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales due to the lack of takeaway infrastructure are the primary cause. Midstream gathering work has been a recurring revenue base that augmented our mainline pipe workforce while mainline activities were at low levels. Until our mainline pipe project is ramped into construction, we forecast that near-term segment margins could be pressured. 
Second, if mainline projects ramp up as expected this year, we will mobilize multiple spreads consisting of several thousand people and a complement of equipment in a very short period of time. We're being prudent with our margin expectations until these projects transition and are in full construction. 
Finally, while we expect our operations that are impacted by the low price of oil to be profitable this year, it will be difficult for these businesses to generate margins higher than mid-single digits, which will affect our overall segment margins.
We're aggressively taking steps to rightsize these operations to operate profitably in the current environment, which will be an ongoing process. As a result, we anticipate taking a $3 million to $4 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, which we have included in our 2016 guidance.
In summary, while we are experienced -- while we have experienced challenges in 2015, we expect profitable growth in 2016 largely from contributions from mainline pipe construction and the non-reoccurrence of the meaningful project losses we had in 2015. We believe the current dynamics impacting the electric power segment are short term, and we have significant projects in backlog and are also working with several customers on future large transmission project opportunities that will play out over a multiyear period.
During my 17 years here at Quanta, I have been through several market down cycles. And in each situation, whether the telecom meltdown in 2001 and 2002 or the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, Quanta has emerged a stronger, better company with improved competitive position within the industry. I expect the same result as we move through our current industry challenges.
We continue to execute on strategies that position Quanta for both near- and long-term growth, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver the customer-driven solutions that have made us the industry leader.
As we close out 2015 with this call, I want to thank our employees who I believe are the very best in the industry, and are the primary reason we consistently differentiate ourselves from our competitors in an ever-changing market environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our financial results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 mi",2833,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 million or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $60.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as presented in today's press release was $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by approximately $0.25 per diluted share of net impairment charges. These charges included asset impairments of $58.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share, primarily associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with lower forecasted oil and gas service revenues for our Gulf of Mexico operations and certain Australian operations due to the extended low commodity price environment. These charges were partially offset by tax benefits of $4.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Also net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by a $30.3 million net of tax charge or $0.14 per diluted share for a provision for long-term contract receivable associated with change orders on a 2012 electric power transmission project that were ultimately settled earlier this year.
Net loss attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter 2015 was $5.1 million or a $0.03 loss per diluted share. This compares to net income attributable to common stock of $66.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the same quarter of last year is primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our large electric transmission and mainline projects, which were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending and delays in project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues. In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters.
Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $70 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our oil and gas infrastructure segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 15.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of the negative impact of lower revenues from mainline and large electric transmission projects, both of which typically carry higher margins than certain other types of projects. 
Also impacting our gross margin for the quarter was $19.3 million of incremental project losses related to a power plant project in Alaska, which is expected to be completed in mid-2016. These incremental costs on the project were largely due to differences in build requirements versus the original engineering, and we are pursuing specific engineering claims to recover a portion of these costs. However, the benefit of potential recovery on these claims has not yet been reflected in our estimates as of year-end.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this quarter's earnings release were $151.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease is primarily due to $6 million in lower salaries and benefits costs associated with the level of operations in 2015, partially offset by $3.5 million in higher professional fees. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this release as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues and its negative impact on the absorption of consolidated overhead costs.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power segment revenues were $1.29 billion, reflecting a decrease of $72.6 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.3%. Lower revenues were a result of reduced customer spending and delays in projects due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted revenues in this segment by approximately $31 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies as well as increased activity from smaller transmission and distribution projects.
Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased slightly to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.4% in last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in margin was primarily due to the previously mentioned incremental loss recorded during the quarter on the power plant project, lower revenues from higher-margin large electric transmission projects as well as a $6.6 million property and equipment impairment charge related to certain international renewable energy services operations. Although these items negatively impacted the operating margins for 4Q '15, for comparative purposes the fourth quarter of 2014 was also impacted by the previously mentioned charge to a provision for long-term contract receivable.
As of December 31, 2015, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased 2.3% and total backlog increased 1.2% when compared to September 30, 2015. The decrease in 12-month backlog is primarily due to burn on existing projects along with the negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total backlog increased due to the inclusion of 2 Latin American telecom concession awards as well as the estimated contribution to total backlog for the renewal of certain MSAs, slightly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $55.8 million or 8.4% to $607.8 million in 4Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of when large mainline projects moved to construction as well as reduced demand for certain of our oil and gas services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. Also changes in foreign currency translation rates negatively impacted revenues contributed by international operations in this segment by approximately $19 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were revenue contributions of approximately $45 million from acquired companies as well as increased revenues from distribution services.
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 3.9% in 4Q '15 from 8.1% in 4Q '14. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decline in mainline revenues, which typically yield higher margins as well as lower margins on those mainline projects actually under construction due to typical project variability. Also contributing to this decrease was lower demand for services associated with certain operations as a result of lower oil prices and permitting delays, which negatively impacted the segment's ability to cover fixed costs.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas infrastructure services segment decreased by $184.7 million or 8.9% and total backlog decreased to $336.9 million or 9.9% when compared to September 30, 2015. These decreases were due to the removal of a mainline project from year-end backlog that Jim referenced in his prepared comments, burn on existing contracts as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.
Corporate and unallocated costs increased $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 4Q '14 as a result of the $51.9 million charge associated with the previously mentioned goodwill and intangible asset impairments.
Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, provided approximately $618.2 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $183.8 million, resulting in approximately $434.4 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was partially due to decreased working capital requirements associated with the decrease in the number of large electric transmission jobs ramping up this year as compared to last year, the receipt of approximately $87 million in a project prepayment for a project with production beginning in 2015 [ph] and the receipt of a $65 million cash payment for the Sunrise Powerlink project receivable in the first quarter of 2015.
Also cash flows related to discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by a payment of approximately $134 million associated with taxes payable from the gain on sale of Sunesys. DSOs were 75 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 85 days at September 30, 2015, and 84 days at December 31, 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the impact at December 31, 2015, of the inclusion of the $87 million project prepayment discussed previously and strong collections in the fourth quarter of 2015. DSOs at December 31, 2014, were negatively impacted by the inclusion of the $65 million Sunrise Powerlink project receivable and the impact of the acquisition of working capital balances late in the fourth quarter 2014, for which there were no material corresponding fourth quarter revenues.
Investing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $9 million, net of cash acquired related to the closing of 1 acquisition in Canada during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 came from net borrowings of $131.3 billion under our credit facility, partially used to fund the repurchase of 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $76.8 million. 
To recap our share repurchase activity, we repurchased a total of 59.3 million shares for a value of approximately $1.46 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. We've also paid $150 million under an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, the ASR, entered into on August 10, 2015, for shares expected to be delivered upon final settlement of the ASR in April of this year.
At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $128.8 million in cash. At the end of the year, we had about $307 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $466.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. As previously announced, we increased our credit facility in December 2015 to $1.81 billion and extended maturity to December 2020. Favorable market conditions allowed us to maintain a competitive pricing and structure, including increased capacity to fund operations outside of the U.S. As such, we opportunistically amended the credit facility with the increasing commitments providing for approximately $1.16 billion of liquidity as of December 31, 2015. 
Turning to guidance. Throughout 2015, we have evaluated whether or not providing quarterly earnings guidance is beneficial given the short-term volatility that can occur due to the variability in project timing and other impact factors that impact earnings from period to period. As we move into 2016, we will only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year.
For the year ended 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% at the low end of our guidance to year-over-year revenues in the segment remaining flat at the high end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment. As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to revenues and margins. We would expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter being the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter fall somewhere between the second and third quarter.
Of note, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. The slowing of the Canadian economy, reduced activity in the Canadian oil sand and the timing of project starts has reduced the seasonal offsets or flattening that Canadian revenues had provided in the first and second quarter over the past few years. This, coupled with lower large electric transmission and mainline project revenues compared to the first quarter of last year causes us to estimate that our first quarter revenues could potentially decline up to 10%.
On the other hand, we expect a sizable ramp in revenues in the third quarter as we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with electric power somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas margins between 5.5% and 7%. Jim commented in his prepared remarks as to the primary factors affecting these margin estimates. 
In addition, largely due to ramp in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas due largely due to the timing of mainline project starts. Our markets remain in a fluid environment with some areas of our business growing and others having challenges. As it relates to recent actions taken by management to improve margins, we've made headcount adjustments at our corporate office as well at various operating units as further evidenced by the restructuring costs associated with our offshore operations expected in the first quarter; the shutdown of our Middle East operations, which led to the fourth quarter tax benefit; as well as the rightsizing of our international operations, which included the impairment of certain renewable energy assets in the fourth quarter. These are just a few examples of our focus on adjusting the business to return margins to our target levels.
We would estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%.
Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continuing movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause the actual financial results to differ from guidance.
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended 2016, we're assuming 156.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our estimates include a projected reduction of approximately 10 million shares in April of 2016, which is the estimated settlement date of the ASR program and when final settlement of the required shares to be delivered is anticipated to take place. There are many factors that can influence our estimate of the final number of shares anticipated to be delivered under the ASR program, including an option and further fluctuations in the stock price.
We currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50 and anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.58 and $1.78.
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
Despite the challenges we experienced in 2015, we had several significant accomplishments that financially position us well for the future. The sale of our fiber optic licensing operations unlocked significant value and generate significant after-tax proceeds. Along with these proceeds, we utilized a record free cash flow and availability under our credit facility to repurchase nearly $1.5 billion for our common stock in 2015 and an additional $150 million has been paid under the ASR, which effectively recapitalized our balance sheet and improved our cost of capital.
In addition, we increased the capacity and extended the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, increasing liquidity to assist in achieving strategic objectives that we believe will continue to generate shareholder value. We closed 11 acquisitions during 2015 for an aggregate consideration consisting of $110.4 million in cash and $10.1 million in securities, which enhanced our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service capabilities. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and be positioned for continued internal growth and to execute on strategic initiatives.
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.

I would guess probably half the volume, but the segment revenue should still grow because we do think our LBC markets and our mainline markets will grow and make up for that downturn. But it does create some volatility in earnings in particular when you haven't ramped up significantly in mainline.

We're not at a ramp level now on mainline, so the first half of the year will be a drag on margins. When we do have a full complement of mainline going in the second -- or particularly in the third quarter, we should see us moving into that 9% to 12% range if we execute. But for the full year, we expect it to be a drag, primarily because of the lack of gathering work that we've done over the last several years and also, we've got segment -- about 15% of our business that has been impacted directly by oil prices. Where we have operations that will be generating, we expect them to generate positive margins but certainly, nowhere near that 9% to 12% range in the areas impacted by oil and gas. So when you look at the entire segment and the dynamics that are occurring today, we feel like it will be challenging to be in that 9% range. Now -- but that is our expectation long term and we're going to continue to make adjustments. And certainly, if mainline takes off like we expect in the next several years, we do think it's possible to get into that range at some point in time. But this year is going to be challenging."

And then I guess, the follow-up would be, Derrick, I think or Jim, last quarter, you guys talked about if you didn't see business picking up, you could take a -- you would be a little more assertive on the cost cutting front, and in a suboptimal top line market you could sort of get to the 10% margin. What would you need to see to be more aggressive on the cost-cutting side to improve margins?

And the mix of smaller projects to larger projects is certainly back to levels that we had in 2010. With that said, we have a significant amount of transmission and backlog that we will need to execute on in 2017. We have to maintain some of our core capabilities and not be shortsighted. We've got that large project, the West Mac project that we've got to execute on the concession we won in Alberta. And again, we're very early still on an Alpaugh job, and we expect other awards to come out that will be sizable in the coming years.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Service first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. 1 the call, will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of the first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
As many of you know, in March, Jim and our Board of Directors decided the time is right for me to step into the CEO role as part of Quanta's leadership transition planning process. I am humbled and honored by the trust and confidence that are placed in with disappointment. I feel fortunate to transition into the role following Jim's leadership and strong direction over the past 5 years. I am the third CEO of Quanta. I've had the privilege to work with great industry leaders over my 2-decade career. I'm fourth generation in the business and began working side-by-side with my father in the field. I spent the last 15 years of my career at Quanta Services, most recently as Chief Operating Officer. I worked closely with Jim, Derrick, and our founder, John Colson, and others to develop Quanta's strategic initiatives. As such, you can expect the continued focus on operational excellence in building a company for long-term profitable growth.  With that, we will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will also continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I look forward to future conversations with you through the year and appreciate your support. 
Quanta's first quarter results put us on track to achieve our full year outlook. Revenues were$1.7 billion for the first quarter. Diluted GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.13 and $0.23 respectively. While these items declined versus last year's first quarter which was expected, we ended the quarter with record backlog which exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the company's history. We believe this bodes well for Quanta as we progress through the year and for the years to come. For our Electric segment, the volume of larger transmission projects revenues declined quarter-over-quarter, and our Canadian operations are experiencing a challenging operating environment due to the Canadian economy. Despite these headwinds, our core transmission and distribution operations executed well. We did incur additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska which we have spoken about in prior calls. As we entered the testing and commissioning phases of the project, we experienced engineering and production issues that created additional construction cost. We advise our total estimates on the project to factor in these issues and additional time on the side and recognize this extra cost in the first quarter. Additional resources have been allocated to deliver a quality project to the customer and bring it to scheduled completion. Although we anticipate putting those claims where a significant amount of these costs related to these issues, we have not recognized any potential recovery at this point. The project is more than 90% complete and we expect to finish it in the third quarter of this year. These losses were not previously contemplated in our guidance, which highlights the strong performance in our core transmission and distribution operations in the first quarter. With respect to margins, I want to reiterate that we are committed to returning margins to historical levels. However, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities and long-term approach to growing the business. We are proactively addressing our margins by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, continuing to optimize the use of our equipment resources across the company and providing value added solutions to our customers. We expect improved electric margins, segment margins results this year and maintain our positive multiyear outlook on the North American electric transmission and distribution markets. The industry drivers that we have discussed with you over the years remain firmly in place to spur infrastructure investment, such as an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing regulations. We also see several new drivers that we believe will be positive for our industry, such as the extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit; New York's clean energy standard, which calls for 50% of the electricity consumed in the United States to come from renewable resources by 2030; and the Canadian government's clean energy transmissions and regional transmission plants. We believe all of these are significant drivers for new generation sources, which will require greater transmission investment for grid connection in the United States and Canada. 
The high-voltage electric transmission award opportunity that we have referenced over the last few quarters are exemplified by a recent contract with Eversource Energy to build a Northern Pass transmission project which was signed in the first quarter. This project was previously submitted for the New England Clean Energy RFP as part of a competitive process seeking a transmission solution to advance the clean energy goals of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and should bring clean energy to New England power grid. If selected, the Northern Pass transmission project will be in approximately 192-mile [ph] transmission line that will bring more than 1,000 megawatts of clean, affordable, hydroelectricity from Canada to New England. This project was not reflected in our backlog at the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, our distribution services continue to grow as our customers increase spending levels to upgrade aging distribution infrastructure and to harden systems to better withstand extreme weather events. The electric distribution market has been growing nicely for several years, and we believe distribution investment should continue to grow. For example, estimates from the C3 Group call for North American electric distribution construction spending to exceed $35 billion through 2020. Overall, we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric segment. We will continue to build our base business while remaining nimble to capitalize on large, multiyear project opportunities that develop. 
Turning over to our Oil & Gas segment, revenues and margins were lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year which was also consistent with our expectations. We expect improved performance for this segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half driven by expected significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. We expect to have a greater number of large pipeline projects in construction this year than any other year since 2010. The large pipeline market is very active, with projects successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and an active bidding and negotiating environment. In the first quarter, we signed large pipeline contracts for an aggregate contract value of more than $800 million, which we expect to realize this year next. Looking forward, we continue to work with our customers on additional large pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. The need for natural gas associated with coal to gas generation switching, natural gas mainline system redundancy and increased natural gas demand, particularly in the Northeast, are all drivers of current natural gas pipeline demand. And as LNG export facilities come on line in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities. While the LNG market is facing challenges due to lower oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. We believe our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services have attractive growth opportunities as well. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, recently proposed new regulations that should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate. 
And then finally, a strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic. One of our strategic initiatives for long-term growth is to find adjacent market and new market opportunities. Over the past several years, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure services operations in Canada by leveraging our electric power services resource's reputation and relationships. We have also successfully greenfield and grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets. You may recall from our fourth quarter earnings call that we were recently awarded 2 sizable telecom concession projects in Latin America. We hope to leverage our telecom success in Latin America and to the electric power and other infrastructure service opportunities in that region. 
Following the expiration of our telecom noncompete arrangement, a natural progression of these efforts and our success will be to expand our operations in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market, which we believe offers a significant long-term growth opportunity. We will currently perform limited telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S., consistent with what is permitted by the terms of our noncompete arrangement. I'm not going to go into detail about our strategy to return to the market today, but once our noncompete arrangement expires later this year, we envision growing our Telecom Infrastructure Services business in the United States. 
In summary, we expect a significant increase in activity levels in the second half of the year and are on track to achieve our full year outlook. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and believe we are well-positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers. Quanta's entrepreneurial business model is unique and a critical driver of our success. We believe we have the best leadership and the best skilled workforce in the markets we serve. The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a nimble company with a comprehensive breadth of self-performed infrastructure solutions which significantly distinguishes us in the marketplace. All of this positions us to generate long-term shareholder value while maintaining the core values that have served us well through changing market conditions. 
With that, I will now turn over the call to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the first quarter results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations of $47.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.28 for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily a result of few ongoing larger electric transmission and large diameter pipeline projects in the current quarter, resulting mainly from fluctuations in project timing and regulatory delays on certain mainline pipe projects, and to a lesser extent from reduced demand from services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $32 million or 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2015 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues, generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power and Construction Services segment. 
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to increased costs associated with continued engineering and production issues on the power plant construction project in Alaska that resulted in $21.3 million of project losses recorded during the first quarter of 2016 and the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from large electric transmission and mainline pipe projects, which typically yield higher margins. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $158.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former president and chief executive officer, as well as severance and restriction cost associated with certain operations, primarily with  the oil and gas segment, which totaled approximately $6.3 million. In addition, increases were from $3.6 million and incremental general and administrative costs associated with the acquired companies and $3.6 million in higher salaries and benefits costs, largely associated with cost-of-living increases.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.3% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the severance and restructuring costs previously -- mentioned previously, as well as reduced revenues for the first quarter of 2016. 
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.19 billion, reflecting a decrease of $53.3 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4.3%. Quarter-over-quarter revenues were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending, primarily associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted first quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $18 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies and approximately $12 million of higher emergency restoration services revenues. 
Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 8.8% in last year's first quarter. This decrease was due to increased costs in the power plant project in Alaska during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the decrease in revenues from our large electric transmission project mentioned previously negatively impacted this segment's margins as our revenue mix shifted to a higher proportion of smaller scale transmission work. Although we experienced strong execution on transmission work overall this quarter, this change in revenue mix inherently carries a higher degree of inefficiencies associated with transitioning between smaller projects that are not experienced during continuous production of larger projects as well as certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the first quarter of 2016. 
As of March 31, 2016, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment decreased by 1.4% and total backlog increased 1.4% when compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in total backlog was largely attributable to approximately $90 million of favorable changes in currency rates. Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $94.4 million or 15.2% to $526.7 million in the first quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of fluctuations in large project timing, regulatory delays on certain large mainline pipe projects, and to a lesser extent, reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. Segment revenues contributed from our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $14 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Operating income for the Oil & Gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.1% in 1Q '16 from 3.9% in 1Q '15. This decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the decreases in revenues from large diameter pipeline projects, which typically carry higher margins, the impact of lower overall revenues reported by the segment, which negatively impacted this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs, as well as the impact of approximately $2 million in severance and restructuring costs. 12-month backlog for the Oil & Gas segment increased by $584.5 million or 30.8%. And total backlog increased $608.2 million or 19.8% when compared to December 31, 2015. These increases were due to the order of several large diameter gas transmission projects during the quarter. It is worth noting that as a result of these awards, as of the end of the first quarter, the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance does not include any uncommitted revenues associated with large diameter pipeline projects. 
Corporate and unallocated costs increased to $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 1Q '15, primarily as a result of $4 million in costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former president and chief executive officer. For the first quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $199.7 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $42.6 million, resulting in approximately $157.1 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $122.4 million for the first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by lower working capital requirements due to fewer ongoing large electric transmission and large diameter pipeline projects in the quarter. DSOs were 76 days at March 31, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 84 days at March 31, 2015. DSOs were lower at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, '15, primarily due to favorable billing terms for certain large projects ongoing in 2016. Investing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $39.7 million net of cash acquired related to the closing of 3 acquisitions during the quarter. Financing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by net repayments of $75.2 million under our credit facility. At March 31, 2016 we had approximately $155.3 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we had about $321.1 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $397.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility leaving us with approximately $1.25 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2016. 
As previously mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release call, we only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year if needed. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the electric power segment. As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to consolidated revenues and margins. We continue to expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter expected to be the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter to fall somewhere between that of the second and third quarter, and that overall, the second half of the year to be more heavily weighted than the first half of the year. 
Consistent with our previous guidance commentary, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters in 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. We expect a sizable ramp-up in revenues through the third quarter as we expect a significant number of large pipeline projects to begin moving through construction in the second and third quarters of this year. For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with the Electric Power segment margins somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas segment margins between 5.5% and 7%. In addition, largely due to the ramp-up in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality, with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas segment due largely to the anticipated timing of large pipeline project starts. We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rate in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cost actual financial results to differ from guidance. 
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 156.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our previous guidance, our estimates include the reduction in shares in April 2016 associated with the final settlement of the shares delivered under the ASR program. The actual shares delivered as part of that settlement was approximately 9.4 million shares. This brings the total shares retired under the arrangement to 35.1 million shares at an average price of $21.36. In total, under our previously authorized $1.25 billion share repurchase program, we have acquired $1.2 billion of stock at an average of $22.10. Under the current and most previously completed share repurchase program, we have now repurchased approximately $1.7 billion or 71.7 million shares of our common stock. This has reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 32% and reduced them to the level we last had almost a decade ago. This, while Quanta is now nearly 4x the revenues of our company back then and while maintaining a current leverage profile of less than 1 term of EBITDA. We would intend to use the remaining $50 million available under our 2015 program to repurchase additional shares opportunistically depending on the overall capital needs of the company. Despite of the incremental project loss recorded during the first quarter, we continue to anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.61 to $1.81. 
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on the basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same, with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisition, investments and repurchase of Quanta's stock. 
Lastly, I worked closely with Jim throughout his entire 17-year career at Quanta and we all would like to thank him for his many and significant contributions. Through his years here, he helped put in place much of the foundation that made this organization a success. He is a valued leader, and we all wish him well. Jim and Duke forever worked as a team sets that for us; the transition to Duke as our CEO is natural, anticipated and supported by our entire organization, and we look forward to many successful years with his leadership.

If I look at Electric Power, you mentioned another word that you booked which wasn't in the first quarter backlog. Your margins x the project were again at the higher end of what you're targeting for the year. If I look at the oil and gas business, recognizing the first quarter margins were weak, but we expected that the bookings that you put up in the quarter and what appears will happen throughout the year are pretty good. So I'm just trying to understand why margins could potentially be higher given the bookings that we have and the underlying profitability of the business. So is it still uncertain while you book things on timing? Is it -- is the pricing environment more competitive so the stuff that we're booking is lower margin? I'm just trying to get a feel for why margins broadly couldn't potentially be higher because the bookings are there unless there are other projects that were more concerned about. And I guess, my second question, Duke, as you, it is a question to more strategically. Back to the telecom business, why you can't give us your exact plan as you're refocusing on the telecom business. Do we read that as potentially longer term or an 18 month you're not as optimistic about that growth opportunities at the electric power or the oil and gas business can generate? I'm just trying to think is this incremental? Or is this a diversification strategy, because you see one of the other businesses sort of tapering out."

We don't want to get too far on this strategy on any set in one of them but that is certainly something we are looking at to grow us into the future. As far as our end markets, our end markets that we are currently in today are robust. We are in the telecom market in Latin America and Canada, and it's a good market there as well.

We're seeing the lower margin profile, but it has nothing to do with the bidding environment or the way we're approaching bidding. Our margins from our backup from bidding perspective are comparable from what you're seeing in the past. What we have got though as we face the rest of 2016, you have a lower contribution of the larger transmission work and those carry higher margins. So you have a higher complement of the small transmission work which bears a little bit lower margin. And then in addition, the Canadian economy overall has put pressure on the margins in the electric side there and we're factoring that into our expectations for 2016. So it's not a pricing or a bidding environment for us. It's really just the kind of the complement of the work that's contributing to '16 versus what you've seen in recent past. Also actually you made reference to the project that we announced that is not in backlog. At this stage of the game, that's also not in our expectations because it's not in backlog either at 3/31 or in the second quarter. We have not place that project and backlog at all as of yet. And then still relevant relative to the pipeline side, we're mobilizing on a lot of jobs all at the same time, here into the second, third quarter and to that end, that bears a degree of risk and we try to take that into consideration in our margin expectations. Mobilizing on that much work, you want to be prudent as to how you think about the execution profile of that. Lastly, as you mentioned, there is a degree of the timing of when that work falls. We try to be prudent on that, looking at how in the past we've had projects move from one quarter to another, from purchasing delays, inclusive of the fact that we anticipate some risk that projects could move to a certain extent from '16 into '17.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offic",1734,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we'll welcome your questions.
As many of you know, in March, Jim and our Board of Directors decided the time is right for me to step into the CEO role as part of Quanta's leadership transition planning process. I am humbled and honored by the trust and confidence they have placed in me with disappointment. I feel fortunate to transition into the role following Jim's leadership and strong direction over the past 5 years. I am the third CEO of Quanta. I've had the privilege to work with great industry leaders over more than 2 -- my 2-decade career. I am fourth generation in the business and began working side by side with my father in the field. I spent the last 15 years of my career at Quanta Services, most recently as Chief Operating Officer. I worked closely with Jim, Derrick and our founder, John Colson, and others to develop Quanta's strategic initiatives. As such, you can expect the continued focus on operational excellence in building a company for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mind-set will also continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I look forward to future conversations with you through the year and appreciate your support. 
Quanta's first quarter results put us on track to achieve our full year outlook. Revenues were $1.7 billion for the first quarter. Diluted GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.13 and $0.23, respectively. While these items declined versus last year's first quarter, which was expected, we ended the quarter with record backlog which exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the company's history. We believe this bodes well for Quanta as we progress through the year and for the years to come. 
For our electric segment, the volume of larger transmission projects revenues declined quarter-over-quarter, and our Canadian operations are experiencing a challenging operating environment due to the Canadian economy. Despite these headwinds, our core transmission and distribution operations executed well. We did incur additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska, which we have spoken about on prior calls. As we entered the testing and commissioning phases of the project, we experienced engineering and production issues that created additional construction cost. We revised our total estimates on the project to factor in these issues and additional time on the side and recognized this extra cost in the first quarter. 
Additional resources have been allocated to deliver a quality project to the customer and bring it to scheduled completion. Although we anticipate putting work claims for a significant amount of these costs related to these issues, we have not recognized any potential recovery at this point. The project is more than 90% complete, and we expect to finish it in the third quarter of this year. These losses were not previously contemplated in our guidance, which highlight the strong performance in our core transmission and distribution operations in the first quarter. 
With respect to margins, I want to reiterate that we are committed to returning margins to historical levels. However, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities and long-term approach to growing the business. We are proactively addressing our margins by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, continuing to optimize the use of our equipment resources across the company and providing value-added solutions to our customers. We expect improved electric margins -- segment margin results this year and maintain our positive multiyear outlook on the North American electric transmission and distribution markets. The industry drivers that we have discussed with you over the years remain firmly in place to spur infrastructure investment such as an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing regulations. 
We also see several new drivers that we believe will be positive for our industry such as the extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit; New York's Clean Energy Standard, which calls for 50% of the electricity consumed in the state to come from renewable resources by 2030; and the Canadian government's clean energy initiatives and regional transmission plans. We believe all of these are significant drivers for new generation sources, which will require greater transmission investment for grid connection in the United States and Canada. 
The high-voltage electric transmission award opportunity that we have referenced over the last few quarters are exemplified by a recent contract with Eversource Energy to build a Northern Pass transmission project, which was signed in the first quarter. This project was previously submitted for the New England Clean Energy RFP as part of a competitive process seeking a transmission solution to advance the clean energy goals of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and should bring clean energy to New England power grid. If selected, the Northern Pass transmission project will be in approximately a 192-mile transmission line that will bring more than 1,000 megawatts of clean, affordable hydroelectricity from Canada to New England. This project was not reflected in our backlog at the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, our distribution services continue to grow as our customers increase spending levels to upgrade aging distribution infrastructure and to harden the systems to better withstand extreme weather events. The electric distribution market has been growing nicely for several years, and we believe distribution investment could continue to grow. 
For example, estimates from the C3 Group call for North American electric distribution construction spending to exceed $35 billion through 2020. Overall, we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric segment. We will continue to build our base business while remaining nimble to capitalize on large, multiyear project opportunities to develop.
Turning over to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins were lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, which was also consistent with our expectations. We expect improved performance for this segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by expected significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. We expect to have a greater number of large pipeline projects in construction this year than any other year since 2010. 
The large pipeline market is very active, with projects successfully receiving FERC and other approvals in an active bidding and negotiating environment. In the first quarter, we signed large pipeline contracts for an aggregate contract value of more than $800 million, which we expect to realize this year next. Looking forward, we continue to work with our customers on additional large pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. 
The need for natural gas associated with coal-to-gas generation switching, natural gas mainline system redundancy and increased natural gas demand, particularly in the Northeast, are all drivers of current natural gas pipeline demand. And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities. While the LNG market is facing challenges due to lower oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. 
We believe our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services have attractive growth opportunities as well. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, recently proposed new regulations that should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate.
And finally, a strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic. One of our strategic initiatives for long-term growth is to find adjacent market and new market opportunities. Over the past several years, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure services operations in Canada by leveraging our electric power services resources, reputation and relationships. 
We have also successfully greenfield and then grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets. You may recall from our fourth quarter earnings call that we were recently awarded 2 sizable telecom concession projects in Latin America. We hope to leverage our telecom success in Latin America and to the electric power and other infrastructure service opportunities in that region.
Following the expiration of our telecom noncompete arrangement, a natural progression of these efforts and our success will be to expand our operations in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market, which we believe offers a significant long-term growth opportunity. We will currently perform limited telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S., consistent with what is permitted by the terms of our noncompete arrangement. I'm not going to go into detail about our strategy to return to the market today. But once our noncompete arrangement expires later this year, we envision growing our telecom infrastructure services business in the United States. 
In summary, we expect a significant increase in activity levels in the second half of the year and are on track to achieve our full year outlook. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve and believe we are well positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers. 
Quanta's entrepreneurial business model is unique and a critical driver of our success. We believe we have the best leadership and the best skilled workforce in the markets we serve. The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a nimble company with a comprehensive breadth of self-performed infrastructure solutions, which significantly distinguishes us in the marketplace. All of this positions us to generate long-term shareholder value while maintaining the core values that have served us well through changing market conditions.
With that, I will now turn over the call to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the first quarter results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted",2188,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations of $47.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.28 for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily a result of fewer ongoing larger electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the current quarter, resulting mainly from fluctuations in project timing and regulatory delays on certain mainline pipe projects and, to a lesser extent, from reduced demand from services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. 
In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $32 million or 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2015 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to increased costs associated with continued engineering and production issues on the power plant construction project in Alaska that resulted in $21.3 million of project losses recorded during the first quarter of 2016 and the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from large electric transmission and mainline pipe projects, which typically yield higher margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $158.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer; as well as severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations, primarily with -- in the oil and gas segment, which totaled approximately $6.3 million. 
In addition, increases were from $3.6 million and incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquired companies; and $3.6 million in higher salaries and benefits costs, largely associated with cost of living increases. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.3% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the severance and restructuring costs previously -- mentioned previously as well as reduced revenues for the first quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.19 billion, reflecting a decrease of $53.3 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4.3%. Quarter-over-quarter revenues were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending, primarily associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted first quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $18 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies and approximately $12 million of higher emergency and restoration services revenues. 
Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 8.8% in last year's first quarter. This decrease was due to increased costs in the power plant project in Alaska during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the decrease in revenues from a large electric transmission project mentioned previously negatively impacted this segment's margins as our revenue mix shifted to a higher proportion of smaller-scale transmission work. Although we experienced strong execution on transmission work overall this quarter, this change in revenue mix inherently carries a higher degree of inefficiencies associated with transitioning between smaller projects that are not experienced during continuous production on larger projects as well as certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the first quarter of 2016.
As of March 31, 2016, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased by 1.4%, and total backlog increased 1.4% when compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in total backlog was largely attributable to approximately $90 million of favorable changes in currency rates. 
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $94.4 million or 15.2% to $526.7 million in the first quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of fluctuations in large project timing, regulatory delays on certain large mainline pipe projects, and to a lesser extent, reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. 
Segment revenues contributed from our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $14 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.1% in 1Q '16 from 3.9% in 1Q '15. This decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the decreases in revenues from large-diameter pipeline projects, which typically carry higher margins; the impact of lower overall revenues reported by the segment, which negatively impacted this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs; as well as the impact of approximately $2 million in severance and restructuring costs. 
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment increased by $584.5 million or 30.8%, and total backlog increased $608.2 million or 19.8% when compared to December 31, 2015. These increases were due to the award of several large-diameter gas transmission projects during the quarter. It is worth noting that as a result of these awards, as of the end of the first quarter, the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance does not include any uncommitted revenues associated with large-diameter pipeline projects.
Corporate and unallocated costs increased to $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 1Q '15, primarily as a result of $4 million in costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer. 
For the first quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $199.7 million, and net capital expenditures were approximately $42.6 million, resulting in approximately $157.1 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $122.4 million for the first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by lower working capital requirements due to fewer ongoing large electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the quarter. 
DSOs were 76 days at March 31, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015, and 84 days at March 31, 2015. DSOs were lower at March 31, 2016, compared to March 31, '15, primarily due to favorable billing terms for certain large projects ongoing in 2016. 
Investing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $39.7 million, net of cash acquired, related to the closing of 3 acquisitions during the quarter. Financing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by net repayments of $75.2 million under our credit facility. 
At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $155.3 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we had about $321.1 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $397.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.25 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2016.
As previously mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release call, we only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year if needed. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment. 
As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to consolidated revenues and margins. We continue to expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter expected to be the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter to fall somewhere between that of the second and third quarter, and that overall, the second half of the year to be more heavily weighted than the first half of the year.
Consistent with our previous guidance commentary, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters in 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. We expect a sizable ramp-up in revenues through the third quarter as we expect a significant number of large pipeline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. 
For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with the electric power segment margins somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas segment margins between 5.5% and 7%. In addition, largely due to the ramp-up in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality, with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas segment due largely to the anticipated timing of large pipeline project starts. We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rate in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 156.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our previous guidance, our estimates include the reduction in shares in April 2016 associated with the final settlement of the shares delivered under the ASR program. The actual shares delivered as part of that settlement was approximately 9.4 million shares. This brings the total shares retired under the arrangement to 35.1 million shares at an average price of $21.36. In total, under our previously authorized $1.25 billion share repurchase program, we have acquired $1.2 billion of stock at an average of $22.10. Under the current and most previously completed share repurchase programs, we have now repurchased approximately $1.7 billion or 71.7 million shares of our common stock. This has reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 32% and reduced then to the level we last had almost a decade ago, this while Quanta is now nearly 4x the revenues of our company back then and while maintaining a current leverage profile of less than 1x of EBITDA. We would intend to use the remaining $50 million available under our 2015 program to repurchase additional shares opportunistically depending on the overall capital needs of the company. In spite of the incremental project loss recorded during the first quarter, we continue to anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.61 to $1.81.
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on the basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. 
We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta's stock.
Lastly, I worked closely with Jim throughout his entire 17-year career at Quanta, and we all want to thank him for his many and significant contributions. Through his years here, he helped put in place much of the foundation that made this organization a success. He was a valued leader, and we all wish him well. Jim and Duke forever worked as a team sets that for us. The transition to Duke as our CEO is natural, anticipated and supported by our entire organization, and we look forward to many successful years with his leadership.

If I look at electric power, you mentioned another word that you booked which wasn't in the first quarter backlog. Your margins ex the project were again up at the higher end of what you're targeting for the year. If I look at the oil and gas business, recognizing the first quarter margins were weak, but we expected that the bookings that you put up in the quarter and what appears to will happen throughout the year are pretty good. So I'm just trying to understand why margins couldn't potentially be higher given the bookings that we have and the underlying profitability of the business. So is it still uncertain while you book things on timing? Is it -- is the pricing environment more competitive so the stuff that we're booking is lower margin? I'm just trying to get a feel for why margins, broadly, couldn't potentially be higher because the bookings are there unless there's other projects that we're concerned about? And I guess, my second question, Duke, as you -- is a question to you more strategically. Back to the telecom business, while you can't give us your exact plan as you're refocusing on the telecom business, do we read that as potentially longer term or an 18 month you're not as optimistic about that growth opportunities at the electric power or the oil and gas business can generate?

And we stated we -- we don't want to get too far on this strategy on any certain one of them, but that is certainly something we are looking at to grow us into the future. As far as our end markets, our end markets that we're currently in today are robust. We are in the telecom market in Latin America and Canada, and it's a good market there as well.

We're seeing a lower margin profile, but it has nothing to do with the bidding environment or the way we're approaching bidding. I mean, our margins and backlog from a bidding perspective are comparable to what you've seen in the past. What you've got, though, is as we face the rest of 2016, you have a lower contribution on the larger transmission work, and those carry higher margins. So you have a higher complement of the small transmission work, which bears a little bit lower margin. And then in addition, the Canadian economy overall has put pressure on the margins in the electric side there and is -- and we're factoring that into our expectations for 2016. So it's not a pricing or a bidding environment for us. It's really just the kind of the complement of the work that's contributing to '16 versus what you've seen in recent past. Also, actually, you made reference to the project that we announced that is not in backlog. At this stage of the game, that's also not in our expectations because it's not in backlog either at 3/31 or in the second quarter. We have not placed that project in backlog at all as of yet. And then still yet then relative to the pipeline side, we're mobilizing on a lot of jobs all at the same time here in the second and third quarter. And to that end, that bears a degree of risk, and we'll try to take that into consideration in our margin expectations. Mobilizing on that much work, you want to be prudent as you think about the execution profile of that. Lastly, as you mentioned, there is a degree of the timing of when that work falls. We try to be prudent on that, looking at how in the past we've had projects move from one quarter to another from purchasing delays, inclusive of the fact that we anticipate some risks that projects could move to -- in a certain extent, from '16 into '17.

Maybe give us a sense on what was the impact during the quarter and what you're seeing a potential impact in the second here. And then finally, just an overall update, and congrats on the announcement of pipeline in Australia. But can you give us a little bit more granularity there?"

We're worried about our workforce right now and making sure everybody is safe and they are and our customers and make sure their employees are safe. So we reach out to them right now and try to get that. That's our first and foremost, what we're after today and to lead. But I don't foresee that being an impact to us.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we'll welcome your questions.
As many of you know, in March, Jim and our Board of Directors decided the time was right for me to step into the CEO role as part of Quanta's leadership transition planning process. I am humbled and honored by the trust and confidence they have placed in me with this appointment. I feel fortunate to transition into the role following Jim's leadership and strong direction over the past 5 years. I am the third CEO of Quanta, and I've had the privilege to work with great industry leaders over more than 2 -- my 2-decade career. I am fourth generation in the business and began working side by side with my father in the field. I spent the last 15 years of my career at Quanta Services, most recently as Chief Operating Officer. I worked closely with Jim, Derrick and our founder, John Colson, and others to develop Quanta's strategic initiatives. As such, you can expect a continued focus on operational excellence and building a company for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mind-set will also continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I look forward to future conversations with you through the year and appreciate your support. 
Quanta's first quarter results put us on track to achieve our full year outlook. Revenues were $1.7 billion for the first quarter. Diluted GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.13 and $0.23, respectively. While these items declined versus last year's first quarter, which was expected, we ended the quarter with record backlog which exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the company's history. We believe this bodes well for Quanta as we progress through the year and for the years to come. 
For our electric segment, the volume of larger transmission projects revenues declined quarter-over-quarter, and our Canadian operations are experiencing a challenging operating environment due to the Canadian economy. Despite these headwinds, our core transmission and distribution operations executed well. We did incur additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska, which we have spoken about on prior calls. As we entered the testing and commissioning phases of the project, we experienced engineering and production issues that created additional construction costs. We revised our total estimates on the project to factor in these issues and additional time on the site, and recognized these extra costs in the first quarter. 
Additional resources have been allocated to deliver a quality project to the customer and bring it to scheduled completion. Although we anticipate putting forth claims for a significant amount of these costs related to these issues, we have not recognized any potential recovery at this point. The project is more than 90% complete, and we expect to finish it in the third quarter of this year. These losses were not previously contemplated in our guidance, which highlights the strong performance in our core transmission and distribution operations in the first quarter. 
With respect to margins, I want to reiterate that we are committed to returning margins to historical levels. However, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities and long-term approach to growing the business. We are proactively addressing our margins by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, continuing to optimize the use of our equipment resources across the company and providing value-added solutions to our customers. We expect improved electric margins -- segment margins results this year and maintain our positive multiyear outlook on the North American electric transmission and distribution markets. The industry drivers that we have discussed with you over the years remain firmly in place to spur infrastructure investment, such as an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing regulations. 
We also see several new drivers that we believe will be positive for our industry such as the extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit; New York's Clean Energy Standard, which calls for 50% of the electricity consumed in the state to come from renewable resources by 2030; and the Canadian government's clean energy initiatives and regional transmission plants. We believe all of these are significant drivers for new generation sources, which will require greater transmission investment for grid connection in the United States and Canada. 
The high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities that we have referenced over the last few quarters are exemplified by a recent contract with Eversource Energy to build a Northern Pass transmission project, which was signed in the first quarter. This project was previously submitted for the New England Clean Energy RFP as part of a competitive process seeking a transmission solution to advance the clean energy goals of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and should bring clean energy to New England's power grid. If selected, the Northern Pass transmission project will be an approximately 192-mile transmission line that will bring more than 1,000 megawatts of clean, affordable hydroelectricity from Canada to New England. This project was not reflected in our backlog at the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, our distribution services continued to grow as our customers increased spending levels to upgrade aging distribution infrastructure and to harden the systems to better withstand extreme weather events. The electric distribution market has been growing nicely for several years, and we believe distribution investment could continue to grow. 
For example, estimates from the C3 Group call for North American electric distribution construction spending to exceed $35 billion through 2020. Overall, we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric segment. We will continue to build our base business while remaining nimble, to capitalize on large, multiyear project opportunities that develop.
Turning over to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins were lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, which was also consistent with our expectations. We expect improved performance for this segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by expected significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. We expect to have a greater number of large pipeline projects in construction this year than any other year since 2010. 
The large pipeline market is very active, with projects successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and an active bidding and negotiating environment. In the first quarter, we signed large pipeline contracts for an aggregate contract value of more than $800 million, which we expect to realize this year and next. Looking forward, we continue to work with our customers on additional large pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. 
The need for natural gas associated with coal-to-gas generation switching, natural gas mainline system redundancy and increased natural gas demand, particularly in the Northeast, are all drivers of current natural gas pipeline demand. And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities. While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. 
We believe our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services have attractive growth opportunities as well. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, recently proposed new regulations that should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate.
And finally, a strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic. One of our strategic initiatives for long-term growth is to find adjacent market and new market opportunities. Over the past several years, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure services operations in Canada by leveraging our electric power services resources, reputation and relationships. 
We have also successfully greenfielded and grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets. You may recall from our fourth quarter earnings call that we were recently awarded 2 sizable telecom concession projects in Latin America. We hope to leverage our telecom success in Latin America into the electric power and other infrastructure service opportunities in that region.
Following the expiration of our telecom noncompete arrangement, a natural progression of these efforts and our success will be to expand our operations in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market, which we believe offers a significant long-term growth opportunity. We will currently perform limited telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S., consistent with what is permitted by the terms of our noncompete arrangement. I'm not going to go into detail about our strategy to return to the market today. But once our noncompete arrangement expires later this year, we envision growing our telecom infrastructure services business in the United States. 
In summary, we expect a significant increase in activity levels in the second half of the year and are on track to achieve our full year outlook. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve and believe we are well positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers. 
Quanta's entrepreneurial business model is unique and a critical driver of our success. We believe we have the best leadership and the best skilled workforce in the markets we serve. The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a nimble company with a comprehensive breadth of self-performed infrastructure solutions, which significantly distinguishes us in the marketplace. All of this positions us to generate long-term shareholder value while maintaining the core values that have served us well through changing market conditions.
With that, I will now turn over the call to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the first quarter results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted",2187,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations of $47.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.28 for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily a result of fewer ongoing larger electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the current quarter, resulting mainly from fluctuations in project timing and regulatory delays on certain mainline pipe projects, and to a lesser extent, from reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. 
In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $32 million or 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2015 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to increased costs associated with continued engineering and production issues on a power plant construction project in Alaska that resulted in $21.3 million of project losses recorded during the first quarter of 2016 and the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from large electric transmission and mainline pipe projects, which typically yield higher margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $158.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer as well as severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations, primarily within the oil and gas segment, which totaled approximately $6.3 million. 
In addition, increases were from $3.6 million in incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquired companies and $3.6 million in higher salaries and benefits costs, largely associated with cost of living increases. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.3% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the severance and restructuring costs previously -- mentioned previously, as well as reduced revenues for the first quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.19 billion, reflecting a decrease of $53.3 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4.3%. Quarter-over-quarter revenues were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending, primarily associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted first quarter of 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $18 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies and approximately $12 million in higher emergency restoration services revenues. 
Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 8.8% in last year's first quarter. This decrease was due to increased costs on the power plant project in Alaska during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the decrease in revenues from the large electric transmission projects mentioned previously negatively impacted this segment's margins as our revenue mix shifted to a higher proportion of smaller-scale transmission work. Although we experienced strong execution on transmission work overall this quarter, this change in revenue mix inherently carries a higher degree of inefficiencies associated with transitioning between smaller projects that are not experienced during continuous production on larger projects, as well as certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the first quarter of 2016.
As of March 31, 2016, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased by 1.4%, and total backlog increased 1.4% when compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in total backlog was largely attributable to approximately $90 million of favorable changes in currency rates. 
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $94.4 million or 15.2% to $526.7 million in the first quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of fluctuations in large project timing, regulatory delays on certain large mainline pipe projects and to a lesser extent, reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. 
Segment revenues contributed from our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $14 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.1% in 1Q '16 from 3.9% in 1Q '15. This decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the decreases in revenues from large-diameter pipeline projects, which typically carry higher margins; the impact of lower overall revenues reported by this segment, which negatively impacted this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs; as well as the impact of approximately $2 million in severance and restructuring costs. 
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment increased by $584.5 million or 30.8%, and total backlog increased $608.2 million or 19.8% when compared to December 31, 2015. These increases were due to the award of several large-diameter gas transmission projects during the quarter. It is worth noting that as a result of these awards, as of the end of the first quarter, the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance does not include any uncommitted revenues associated with large-diameter pipeline projects.
Corporate and unallocated costs increased to $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 1Q '15, primarily as a result of $4 million in costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer. 
For the first quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $199.7 million, and net capital expenditures were approximately $42.6 million, resulting in approximately $157.1 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $122.4 million for the first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by lower working capital requirements due to fewer ongoing large electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the quarter. 
DSOs were 76 days at March 31, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 84 days at March 31, 2015. DSOs were lower at March 31, 2016, compared to March 31, '15, primarily due to favorable billing terms for certain large projects ongoing in 2016. 
Investing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $39.7 million, net of cash acquired, related to the closing of 3 acquisitions during the quarter. Financing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by net repayments of $75.2 million under our credit facility. 
At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $155.3 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we had about $321.1 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $397.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.25 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2016.
As previously mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release call, we only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year if needed. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment. 
As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to consolidated revenues and margins. We continue to expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter expected to be the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter to fall somewhere between that of the second and third quarter, and that overall, the second half of the year will be more heavily weighted than the first half of the year.
Consistent with our previous guidance commentary, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. We expect a sizable ramp-up in revenues through the third quarter as we expect a significant number of large pipeline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. 
For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with the electric power segment margins somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas segment margins between 5.5% and 7%. In addition, largely due to the ramp-up in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality, with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas segment due largely to the anticipated timing of large pipeline project starts. We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 156.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our previous guidance, our estimates include the reduction in shares in April 2016 associated with the final settlement of the shares delivered under the ASR program. The actual shares delivered as part of that settlement was approximately 9.4 million shares. This brings the total shares retired under the arrangement to 35.1 million shares at an average price of $21.36. In total, under our previously authorized $1.25 billion share repurchase program, we have acquired $1.2 billion of stock at an average of $22.10. Under the current and most previously completed share repurchase programs, we have now repurchased approximately $1.7 billion or 71.7 million shares of our common stock. This has reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 32% and reduced them to the level we last had almost a decade ago, this while Quanta is now nearly 4x the revenues of our company back then and while maintaining a current leverage profile of less than 1 turn of EBITDA. We would intend to use the remaining $50 million available under our 2015 program to repurchase additional shares opportunistically depending on the overall capital needs of the company. In spite of the incremental project loss recorded during the first quarter, we continue to anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.61 to $1.81.
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. 
We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta's stock.
Lastly, I've worked closely with Jim throughout his entire 17-year career at Quanta, and we'd all like to thank him for his many and significant contributions. Through his years here, he helped put in place much of the foundation that made this organization a success. He was a valued leader, and we all wish him well. Jim and Duke forever worked as a team such that for us, the transition to Duke as our CEO is natural, anticipated and supported by our entire organization, and we look forward to many successful years with his leadership.

If I look at electric power, you mentioned another award that you booked, which wasn't in the first quarter backlog. Your margins ex the project were again up at the higher end of what you're targeting for the year. If I look at the oil and gas business, recognizing the first quarter margins were weak, but we expected that, the bookings that you put up in the quarter and what appears to will happen throughout the year are pretty good. So I'm just trying to understand why margins couldn't potentially be higher given the bookings that we have and the underlying profitability of the business. So is it still uncertain while you book things on timing? Is it -- is the pricing environment more competitive so the stuff that we're booking is lower margin? I'm just trying to get a feel for why margins, broadly, couldn't potentially be higher because the bookings are there, unless there's other projects that we're concerned about? And I guess, my second question, Duke, is you more -- is a question to you more strategically. Back to the telecom business, while you can't give us your exact plan, as you're refocusing on the telecom business, do we read that as potentially longer term or an 18 month, you're not as optimistic about the growth opportunities that the electric power or the oil and gas business can generate?

We're seeing a lower margin profile, but it has nothing to do with the bidding environment or the way we're approaching bidding. I mean, our margins and backlog from a bidding perspective are comparable to what you've seen in the past. What you've got, though, is as we face the rest of 2016, you have a lower contribution of the larger transmission work, and those carry higher margins. So you have a higher complement of the small transmission work, which bears a little bit lower margin. And then in addition, the Canadian economy overall has put pressure on the margins in the electric side there and is -- and we're factoring that into our expectations for 2016. So it's not a pricing or a bidding environment for us. It's really just the kind of the complement of the work that's contributing to '16 versus what you've seen in the recent past. Also, actually, you made reference to the project that we announced that is not in backlog. At this stage into the game, that's also not in our expectations because it's not in backlog either at 3/31 or in the second quarter. We have not placed that project in backlog at all as of yet. And then still yet then relative to the pipeline side, we're mobilizing on a lot of jobs all at the same time here in the second and third quarter. And to that end, that bears a degree of risk, and we tried to take that into consideration in our margin expectations. Mobilizing on that much work, you want to be prudent as you think about the execution profile of that. Lastly, as you mentioned, there is a degree of the timing of when that work falls. We try to be prudent at that, looking at how in the past we've had projects move from one quarter to another from -- for some delays, inclusive of the fact that we anticipate some risks that projects could move to -- in a certain extent, from '16 into '17.

I don't want to really get into spreads because I think it's a loose term and I don't want to try to define that. But again, what we said is we'll be on more projects than any time since 2010. So it will be robust in the pipeline market. As far as -- again, we're more worried -- there's some fires in Canada. I know everyone's seen that on the news. We're worried about our workforce right now and making sure everybody's safe and they are, and our customers and making sure their employees are safe. So we reach out to them right now and try to get that. That's our first and foremost what we're after today and into the week. But I don't foresee that being an impact to us. It would be minor, if it was, in the second quarter. And I think the rest of it, I..."

On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offic",1734,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we'll welcome your questions.
As many of you know, in March, Jim and our Board of Directors decided the time was right for me to step into the CEO role as part of Quanta's leadership transition planning process. I am humbled and honored by the trust and confidence they have placed in me with this appointment. I feel fortunate to transition into the role following Jim's leadership and strong direction over the past 5 years. I am the third CEO of Quanta, and I've had the privilege to work with great industry leaders over more than 2 -- my 2-decade career. I am fourth generation in the business and began working side by side with my father in the field. I spent the last 15 years of my career at Quanta Services, most recently as Chief Operating Officer. I worked closely with Jim, Derrick and our founder, John Colson, and others to develop Quanta's strategic initiatives. As such, you can expect a continued focus on operational excellence and building a company for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, we will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mind-set will also continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I look forward to future conversations with you through the year and appreciate your support. 
Quanta's first quarter results put us on track to achieve our full year outlook. Revenues were $1.7 billion for the first quarter. Diluted GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.13 and $0.23, respectively. While these items declined versus last year's first quarter, which was expected, we ended the quarter with record backlog which exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the company's history. We believe this bodes well for Quanta as we progress through the year and for the years to come. 
For our electric segment, the volume of larger transmission projects revenues declined quarter-over-quarter, and our Canadian operations are experiencing a challenging operating environment due to the Canadian economy. Despite these headwinds, our core transmission and distribution operations executed well. We did incur additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska, which we have spoken about on prior calls. As we entered the testing and commissioning phases of the project, we experienced engineering and production issues that created additional construction costs. We revised our total estimates on the project to factor in these issues and additional time on the site, and recognized these extra costs in the first quarter. 
Additional resources have been allocated to deliver a quality project to the customer and bring it to scheduled completion. Although we anticipate putting forth claims for a significant amount of these costs related to these issues, we have not recognized any potential recovery at this point. The project is more than 90% complete, and we expect to finish it in the third quarter of this year. These losses were not previously contemplated in our guidance, which highlights the strong performance in our core transmission and distribution operations in the first quarter. 
With respect to margins, I want to reiterate that we are committed to returning margins to historical levels. However, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities and long-term approach to growing the business. We are proactively addressing our margins by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, continuing to optimize the use of our equipment resources across the company and providing value-added solutions to our customers. We expect improved electric margins -- segment margins results this year and maintain our positive multiyear outlook on the North American electric transmission and distribution markets. The industry drivers that we have discussed with you over the years remain firmly in place to spur infrastructure investment, such as an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing regulations. 
We also see several new drivers that we believe will be positive for our industry such as the extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit; New York's Clean Energy Standard, which calls for 50% of the electricity consumed in the state to come from renewable resources by 2030; and the Canadian government's clean energy initiatives and regional transmission plants. We believe all of these are significant drivers for new generation sources, which will require greater transmission investment for grid connection in the United States and Canada. 
The high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities that we have referenced over the last few quarters are exemplified by a recent contract with Eversource Energy to build a Northern Pass transmission project, which was signed in the first quarter. This project was previously submitted for the New England Clean Energy RFP as part of a competitive process seeking a transmission solution to advance the clean energy goals of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and should bring clean energy to New England's power grid. If selected, the Northern Pass transmission project will be an approximately 192-mile transmission line that will bring more than 1,000 megawatts of clean, affordable hydroelectricity from Canada to New England. This project was not reflected in our backlog at the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, our distribution services continued to grow as our customers increased spending levels to upgrade aging distribution infrastructure and to harden the systems to better withstand extreme weather events. The electric distribution market has been growing nicely for several years, and we believe distribution investment could continue to grow. 
For example, estimates from the C3 Group call for North American electric distribution construction spending to exceed $35 billion through 2020. Overall, we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric segment. We will continue to build our base business while remaining nimble, to capitalize on large, multiyear project opportunities that develop.
Turning over to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins were lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, which was also consistent with our expectations. We expect improved performance for this segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by expected significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. We expect to have a greater number of large pipeline projects in construction this year than any other year since 2010. 
The large pipeline market is very active, with projects successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and an active bidding and negotiating environment. In the first quarter, we signed large pipeline contracts for an aggregate contract value of more than $800 million, which we expect to realize this year and next. Looking forward, we continue to work with our customers on additional large pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. 
The need for natural gas associated with coal-to-gas generation switching, natural gas mainline system redundancy and increased natural gas demand, particularly in the Northeast, are all drivers of current natural gas pipeline demand. And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities. While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. 
We believe our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services have attractive growth opportunities as well. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, recently proposed new regulations that should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate.
And finally, a strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic. One of our strategic initiatives for long-term growth is to find adjacent market and new market opportunities. Over the past several years, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure services operations in Canada by leveraging our electric power services resources, reputation and relationships. 
We have also successfully greenfielded and grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets. You may recall from our fourth quarter earnings call that we were recently awarded 2 sizable telecom concession projects in Latin America. We hope to leverage our telecom success in Latin America into the electric power and other infrastructure service opportunities in that region.
Following the expiration of our telecom noncompete arrangement, a natural progression of these efforts and our success will be to expand our operations in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market, which we believe offers a significant long-term growth opportunity. We will currently perform limited telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S., consistent with what is permitted by the terms of our noncompete arrangement. I'm not going to go into detail about our strategy to return to the market today. But once our noncompete arrangement expires later this year, we envision growing our telecom infrastructure services business in the United States. 
In summary, we expect a significant increase in activity levels in the second half of the year and are on track to achieve our full year outlook. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve and believe we are well positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers. 
Quanta's entrepreneurial business model is unique and a critical driver of our success. We believe we have the best leadership and the best skilled workforce in the markets we serve. The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a nimble company with a comprehensive breadth of self-performed infrastructure solutions, which significantly distinguishes us in the marketplace. All of this positions us to generate long-term shareholder value while maintaining the core values that have served us well through changing market conditions.
With that, I will now turn over the call to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the first quarter results. Derrick?"

Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted",2187,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations of $47.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.28 for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily a result of fewer ongoing larger electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the current quarter, resulting mainly from fluctuations in project timing and regulatory delays on certain mainline pipe projects, and to a lesser extent, from reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. 
In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $32 million or 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2015 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to increased costs associated with continued engineering and production issues on a power plant construction project in Alaska that resulted in $21.3 million of project losses recorded during the first quarter of 2016 and the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from large electric transmission and mainline pipe projects, which typically yield higher margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $158.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer as well as severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations, primarily within the oil and gas segment, which totaled approximately $6.3 million. 
In addition, increases were from $3.6 million in incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquired companies and $3.6 million in higher salaries and benefits costs, largely associated with cost of living increases. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.3% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the severance and restructuring costs previously -- mentioned previously as well as reduced revenues for the first quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.19 billion, reflecting a decrease of $53.3 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4.3%. Quarter-over-quarter revenues were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending, primarily associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted first quarter of 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $18 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies and approximately $12 million in higher emergency restoration services revenues. 
Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 8.8% in last year's first quarter. This decrease was due to increased costs on the power plant project in Alaska during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the decrease in revenues from the large electric transmission projects mentioned previously negatively impacted this segment's margins as our revenue mix shifted to a higher proportion of smaller-scale transmission work. Although we experienced strong execution on transmission work overall this quarter, this change in revenue mix inherently carries a higher degree of inefficiencies associated with transitioning between smaller projects that are not experienced during continuous production on larger projects as well as certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the first quarter of 2016.
As of March 31, 2016, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased by 1.4%, and total backlog increased 1.4% when compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in total backlog was largely attributable to approximately $90 million of favorable changes in currency rates. 
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $94.4 million or 15.2% to $526.7 million in the first quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of fluctuations in large project timing, regulatory delays on certain large mainline pipe projects and to a lesser extent, reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. 
Segment revenues contributed from our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $14 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.1% in 1Q '16 from 3.9% in 1Q '15. This decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the decreases in revenues from large-diameter pipeline projects, which typically carry higher margins; the impact of lower overall revenues reported by this segment, which negatively impacted this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs; as well as the impact of approximately $2 million in severance and restructuring costs. 
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment increased by $584.5 million or 30.8%, and total backlog increased $608.2 million or 19.8% when compared to December 31, 2015. These increases were due to the award of several large-diameter gas transmission projects during the quarter. It is worth noting that as a result of these awards, as of the end of the first quarter, the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance does not include any uncommitted revenues associated with large-diameter pipeline projects.
Corporate and unallocated costs increased to $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 1Q '15, primarily as a result of $4 million in costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer. 
For the first quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $199.7 million, and net capital expenditures were approximately $42.6 million, resulting in approximately $157.1 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $122.4 million for the first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by lower working capital requirements due to fewer ongoing large electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the quarter. 
DSOs were 76 days at March 31, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 84 days at March 31, 2015. DSOs were lower at March 31, 2016, compared to March 31, '15, primarily due to favorable billing terms for certain large projects ongoing in 2016. 
Investing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $39.7 million, net of cash acquired, related to the closing of 3 acquisitions during the quarter. Financing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by net repayments of $75.2 million under our credit facility. 
At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $155.3 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we had about $321.1 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $397.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.25 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2016.
As previously mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release call, we only provide annual guidance and we'll adjust our expectations as we move through the year if needed. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment. 
As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to consolidated revenues and margins. We continue to expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter expected to be the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter to fall somewhere between that of the second and third quarter, and that overall, the second half of the year will be more heavily weighted than the first half of the year.
Consistent with our previous guidance commentary, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. We expect a sizable ramp-up in revenues through the third quarter as we expect a significant number of large pipeline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. 
For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with the electric power segment margins somewhere in the 8% to 9% range and oil and gas segment margins between 5.5% and 7%. In addition, largely due to the ramp-up in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality, with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas segment due largely to the anticipated timing of large pipeline project starts. We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 156.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our previous guidance, our estimates include the reduction in shares in April 2016 associated with the final settlement of the shares delivered under the ASR program. The actual shares delivered as part of that settlement was approximately 9.4 million shares. This brings the total shares retired under the arrangement to 35.1 million shares at an average price of $21.36. In total, under our previously authorized $1.25 billion share repurchase program, we have acquired $1.2 billion of stock at an average of $22.10. Under the current and most previously completed share repurchase programs, we have now repurchased approximately $1.7 billion or 71.7 million shares of our common stock. This has reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 32% and reduced them to the level we last had almost a decade ago, this while Quanta is now nearly 4x the revenues of our company back then and while maintaining a current leverage profile of less than 1 turn of EBITDA. We would intend to use the remaining $50 million available under our 2015 program to repurchase additional shares opportunistically depending on the overall capital needs of the company. In spite of the incremental project loss recorded during the first quarter, we continue to anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.61 to $1.81.
Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. 
We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta's stock.
Lastly, I've worked closely with Jim throughout his entire 17-year career at Quanta, and we'd all like to thank him for his many and significant contributions. Through his years here, he helped put in place much of the foundation that made this organization a success. He was a valued leader, and we all wish him well. Jim and Duke forever worked as a team such that for us, the transition to Duke as our CEO is natural, anticipated and supported by our entire organization, and we look forward to many successful years with his leadership.

If I look at electric power, you mentioned another award that you booked, which wasn't in the first quarter backlog. Your margins ex the project were again up at the higher end of what you're targeting for the year. If I look at the oil and gas business, recognizing the first quarter margins were weak, but we expected that, the bookings that you put up in the quarter and what appears to will happen throughout the year are pretty good. So I'm just trying to understand why margins couldn't potentially be higher given the bookings that we have and the underlying profitability of the business. So is it still uncertain while you book things on timing? Is it -- is the pricing environment more competitive so the stuff that we're booking is lower margin? I'm just trying to get a feel for why margins, broadly, couldn't potentially be higher because the bookings are there, unless there's other projects that we're concerned about? And I guess, my second question, Duke, is you more -- is a question to you more strategically. Back to the telecom business, while you can't give us your exact plan, as you're refocusing on the telecom business, do we read that as potentially longer term or an 18 month, you're not as optimistic about the growth opportunities that the electric power or the oil and gas business can generate?

And we stated -- we don't want to get too far on the strategy on any certain one of them, but that is certainly something that we're looking at to grow us into the future. As far as our end markets, our end markets that we're currently in today are robust. We are in the telecom market in Latin America and Canada, and it's a good market there as well.

We're seeing a lower margin profile, but it has nothing to do with the bidding environment or the way we're approaching bidding. I mean, our margins and backlog from a bidding perspective are comparable to what you've seen in the past. What you've got, though, is as we face the rest of 2016, you have a lower contribution of the larger transmission work, and those carry higher margins. So you have a higher complement of the small transmission work, which bears a little bit lower margin. And then in addition, the Canadian economy overall has put pressure on the margins in the electric side there and is -- and we're factoring that into our expectations for 2016. So it's not a pricing or a bidding environment for us. It's really just the kind of the complement of the work that's contributing to '16 versus what you've seen in the recent past. Also, actually, you made reference to the project that we announced that is not in backlog. At this stage into the game, that's also not in our expectations because it's not in backlog either at 3/31 or in the second quarter. We have not placed that project in backlog at all as of yet. And then still yet then relative to the pipeline side, we're mobilizing on a lot of jobs all at the same time here in the second and third quarter. And to that end, that bears a degree of risk, and we tried to take that into consideration in our margin expectations. Mobilizing on that much work, you want to be prudent as you think about the execution profile of that. Lastly, as you mentioned, there is a degree of the timing of when that work falls. We try to be prudent at that, looking at how in the past we've had projects move from one quarter to another from -- for some delays, inclusive of the fact that we anticipate some risks that projects could move to -- in a certain extent, from '16 into '17.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offi",1672,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
The environment we have been operating in has been challenging for the first 6 months of the year. In particular, our Canadian operations continue to experience the effect of a down market. We continue to make necessary changes in our cost structure to adjust to the market conditions and believe we are on track to deliver on our expectations for the remainder 6 months of the year. However, the ongoing challenges on the power plant project in Alaska distort the overall performance of our core operations. 
As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we incurred additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska during the second quarter. Late in the quarter, during the late stages of the commissioning phase, the project experienced a quaint force majeure event. We have also experienced further deficiencies in third-party engineering, the cost changes to the plan as well as failures of other contractors operating on-site. The combination of these issues resulted in a significant increase in estimated cost to complete the project. We are in the early stages of developing estimates for potential recovery for the items from the customer and other parties.
I am fully aware that we have been discussing the losses on this project for the last year and we take the issue seriously. We are all disappointed that we have incurred additional losses on this project and with the performance of the project overall. We remain focused on completing the project. While our core electric segment performance in the quarter was solid, the power plant losses in the second quarter were not previously contemplated in our guidance. And as a result, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect this impact. We continue to have a positive, long-term outlook for our electric power segment and remain focused on storing our operating income margins for the segment to historical levels.
We continue to believe Quanta's market-leading position, coupled with industry dynamics such as: an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing, newer, more demand and government regulations should provide opportunities for our core Transmission and Distribution operations to grow. We will continue to build our base Transmission and Distribution business while remaining nimble to capitalize on large multiyear project opportunities that develop, as evidenced by the 2 large electric project awards announced this morning.
In June, Quanta was chosen by Midwest utility construct the new 100 mile, double circuit 345-kilovolt transmission line in service territory. Our scope of work includes access roads, foundations, steel polar direction, wire string and material management. Construction began in late June and the project is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018. 
Incremental to electric power backlog at the end of the second quarter is a large electric transmission and distribution project awarded to us by a California-based utility that we sign a contract for in July. Our scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of this project, including rebuilding and replacing approximately 145 miles of 12 and 69-kilovolt underground and overhead electric power infrastructure. Project is located in a national force area in Southern California. Engineering and related services for this project has begun and completion is anticipated in late 2019.
The aggregate contract value of these 2 projects is approximately $500 million. We continue to see substantial bidding activity and are pursuing a number of additional large, high-voltage electric transmission projects in both Canada and the United States. 
As the industry leader in providing solutions for large, high-voltage transmission projects, we believe Quanta is well-positioned to capitalize on the project opportunities we see in the marketplace. Also, you may recall that several years ago, Quanta partnered with American electric power, or AEP, to upgrade approximately 240 miles of the 345-kilovolt transmission infrastructure in South Texas. The line remained in an state using our patent just technologies. For this project in June, AEP won the Edison electric Institute 2016 Edison award, the legend power industry's most prestigious honor. Quanta is proud to have partnered with AEP, and we appreciate the confidence they placed in us to provide them with a safe, innovative and cost-effective infrastructure solution.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins in the second quarter were softer than antiparasitic, primarily due to permitting delays on several large pipeline projects in our backlog and into a lesser extent, due to certain negative project additions. As discussed on prior earnings calls, we expect improved performance for the segment as we move through the year. 
For the second half of the year, a meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. In the second quarter, 3 of our large-diameter pipeline projects were waiting for client authorization to commence work. The authorizations were contingent upon the customers receiving certain government permits, which have taken longer to obtain and have pushed anticipated construction starts state from the second quarter of this year to the third quarter.
We have since received authorization to begin work on one of the projects and believe we can complete the project within our original estimates for the year. For the remaining projects, communications with our customers indicate that work is probable to move forward in the third quarter, which is what is reflected in our current guidance. While project billings generate headlines and the impact of timing and project starts, we believe that on a macro level, such delays, coupled with the healthy and market drivers and strong demand for our large pipeline project services, could yield an active pipeline market that can prove to be a longer and more consistent rather than a relatively short boom and bust cycle. And as NLG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes in natural gas to those facilities.
While the LNG market is facing challenges due to lower oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. The large pipeline market remains very active. We continue to work with our customers on large, additional pipeline projects and have visibility in the significant project activity for the next several years. While some projects are experiencing permitting environmental delays, there are successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and are progressing forward. The bidding and negotiating environment is robust and the majority of our project opportunities in the United States continue to be driven by natural gas. In addition, we are experiencing increasing and ongoing levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada.
Regarding some of the other services we provide in our base business that are reflected in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, demand continues for our natural gas distribution and pipeline services. And we believe there are attractive growth opportunities for many years. 
Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in a natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate. As expected, our midstream gathering activities are down meaningfully first prior years. This is partly due to the lack of Takeaway capacity to open natural gas out of the production areas in the Marcellus and Utica shales the market and lower commodity prices for natural gas liquids. 
Challenging conditions in Canada, due to low oil prices, have also impacted our midstream gathering business. However, we believe that this market is beginning to stabilize. 
In summary, we continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve and believe we are all well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers. As discussed in our prior calls, we believe the first half of this year could be choppy, and it was. However, we expect a significant increase in activity levels and improve financial results in the second half of the year, which is supported by a strong backlog. In addition, we believe market conditions for our Canadian electric power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services operations has stabilized and that those markets are in early stages of recovery. 
We believe consolidation among our customers in both the electric utility pipeline industries will be positive for Quanta going forward. As our customers get larger, they are continuing to partner with Quanta because of our scope and scale, innovative solutions and strong financial position. We are also seeing the convergence of the electric utility in natural gas pipeline, which we anticipated years ago and are well positioned to benefit from. Looking forward, in market drivers, our entrepreneurial business model, having the best field leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace and position us to critique to grow our core business over time.
We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large, high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium-term and a large pipeline project market remains robust with a multi-year cycle ahead of us. This management team is focused on operating the business for the long term. We will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,378244077,1024774,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6",2338,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6 million or 11% per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $32 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as percent it in today's release was $0.18 for the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2015.
Although Duke commented a bit on some of the items impacting our results for the quarter, I'll provide some additional commentary before discussing the detailed financial review. As pointed out in today's earnings release, the power plant construction project in Alaska negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $30.5 million in project losses or $0.12 per diluted share. At quarter end, this project had a contract value at $201 million and was approximately 90% complete. This project is expected to be substantially completed near the end of the third quarter of 2016. As this project continues to the final commissioning phases, it is possible that additional unforeseen circumstances or other performance issues could occur and result in recognition of additional losses on this project. However, our current estimates represent all issues known at this time.
The year-to-date project losses on the power plant are $51.8 million or $31.6 million net of tax and $0.20 per diluted share and has impacted the year-to-date electric power segment operating margins by approximately 220 basis points. We are in the process of developing claims related to these losses that resulted during an even prior to the second quarter. However, we have not reflected any damage recovery in our estimate of total project loss.
Our results for the quarter were also negatively impacted by certain other items that were outside of our previous expectations. As Duke spoke of, we have lower overall reported revenues versus our expectations, which had a corresponding adverse impact on gross profit, driven largely by shifts in the timing of the start date on certain large-diameter pipeline projects and to a lesser extent, negative impact associated with the wildfires in Alberta, Canada. 
Additionally, we had some slight over edges in cost existing projects within do oil and gas segment, some of which we will be seeking to recover through future change orders, but otherwise, negatively impacted the quarter by around $0.02. 
Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter and year is higher than anticipated due to the current estimate of the mix of our annual earnings being more heavily weighted to domestic rather than foreign operations, as well as the effects of a reduction in expected tax benefits from foreign restructurings, which were originally expected to benefit the entire year, but now won't be a benefit until the third quarter. These tax items impacted the quarter by approximately $0.02.
Turning to a broader discussion of our quarter-over-quarter results. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with the decrease in larger electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects, as customers continue to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirement from state and federal agencies and more stringent permitting processes. This increased regulatory environment impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other necessary infrastructure projects, which has had a corresponding negative impact on the level of demand for our services. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $40 million in revenues, generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure services Segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.2% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.2% in the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from larger electric transmission projects and larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins. In addition, the higher cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, as compared to last quarter and the lack of corresponding change orders on these costs, impacted margin comparability.
Reverse margins were also impacted by losses on the power plant project to $30.5 million in the quarter, which compares to $25.1 million of losses during the 3 months ended June 30, 2015 related to the same power plant project and an electric transmission project in Canada. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $6.7 million as compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was a result of $2.8 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development efforts and $2.2 million in incremental G&A cost associated with the acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 8.7% in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2015. This increase was due to the slightly higher G&A costs, as well as the reduced revenues for the second quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.16 billion, reflecting a decrease of $63.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.2%. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by continued regulatory constraint on the volume and timing of customer spending as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which included higher levels of revenues from larger transmission projects that were nearing completion.
Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted second quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $8 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 6.6% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned reduced revenues from larger electric transmission projects and the corresponding increase in lower margin revenues from smaller scale transmission work. In addition, margins are negatively impacted by certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the quarter as we continue to bear certain costs to ensure we are positioned to execute on larger transmission opportunities.
As I mentioned previously, operating margins for the second quarters of both 2016 and 2015 were negatively impacted by project losses on 1 or 2 large projects. As of June 30, 2016, 12 months backlog to the electric power segment was relatively flat and total backlog decreased slightly when compared to March 31, 2016, due to normal contract burn being effectively offset by a new contract awards. Backlog, as of quarter end, does not reflect the large California transmission and distribution project announcement included in today's release.
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $16.7 million or 2.6% to $633.3 million in the second quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of the fluctuations in large project timing I spoke of earlier. Segment revenues contributed by international operations were also negatively impacted by approximately $6 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased activity from distribution services, as well as the contributions of approximately $10 million of revenues from acquired companies.
Operating income to the oil and gas segment, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 1.9% in 2Q '16 from 5.5% in 2Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margin, as well as our higher contribution from distribution services, which typically carry a lower margin profile. 
Also negatively impacting operating income were higher costs associated with challenging site conditions in an ongoing transmission project in Canada and a customer request for additional project closeout efforts on a U.S. transmission project that was substantially completed in 2015. While we intend to pursue change orders for additional compensation from our customers for certain of these items, no portion of these amounts have been included in our estimates of contract value as of quarter end. 12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $47.8 million or 1.9%, and total backlog decreased $273.7 million or 7.4% when compared to March 31, 2016. These decreases were due to burn backlog partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts.
Corporate and unallocated cost decreased to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2Q '15, primarily as a result of lower acquisition and integration cost due to the timing of acquisitions. For the second quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $66.5 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $55.7 million, resulting in approximately $10.8 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $51.4 million for the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the less favorable operating results.
Cash flows from operations for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 provided approximately $266.3 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $98.3 million, resulting in approximately $168 million of year-to-date free cash flow. 
Despite fairly strong year-to-date free cash flow, unbilled production up in the approval process with a few customers has kept our working capital requirements a bit higher. We expect to see some resolution to these billing delays during the third quarter. However, the ramp-up of the large-diameter pipeline work in the latter half of the year is expected to be a use of cash. So it remains difficult to estimate the overall free cash flow for the year.
DSOs were 74 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 85 days at June 30, 2015. At quarter end, we had approximately $162.3 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had about $317.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our cash of the interest program and other contractual commitments. And we had $398 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.26 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.75 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a 3% decline year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher end of our estimates with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment.
As it relates to seasonality, we continue to expect and market increase in revenues and margins as we move into the third quarter, largely driven by the timing of our large-diameter pipeline work. Additionally, due to some of the project timing issues that Duke spoke of earlier, we believe the fourth quarter revenues may not decline as we have seen with typical seasonality in the past, but instead would likely increase when compared to this year's third quarter. For 2016, we believe the electric power segment operating margins should be around 8% with the year-to-date losses of the power plant of $51.8 million having a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points on the overall update for the segment.
We still see the oil and gas segment margins coming in between 5.5% and 7% for the year. But due to the lower margin seen in the first and second quarter of 2016, the upper end may be more challenging. Also, due to the revenue shifts mentioned earlier, margins in the oil and gas guess segment are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. 
Our outlook includes estimates for project start dates that we believe are probably based on customer communications. However, variances in these estimates start dates could lead to revenue and earnings results that may be materially different from our current estimates. In addition, some of these projects are larger in contract value, such as the performance of any individual project that significantly exceeds or is less in our current estimates could also impact our earnings results materially.
Lastly, our outlook does not assume any recovery of the project losses recognized to date on the power plant project even though the company is pursuing various remedies for recovery.
We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $17 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be around 39.5%. The third and fourth quarter rate will be around 38.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign change rates good rate comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 157.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.
We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.20 and $1.35 and contemplate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.52 and $1.67. I believe it is important to note that had it not been for the incremental impact of the second quarter loss from the power plant project in Alaska, our previous annual guidance would have remained unchanged.
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.

When you think about the last half of the year ago, in order for us to get into those upper -- the margin range that we're talking about overall for oil and gas, it's going to require that the third and fourth quarters have margins that are much more substantial than the first half. But those margins will be very near our historical margin guidance. We've often guided oil and gas is having opportunity to be in the 9% to 12% range based upon the complement of contributions of large diameter pipe. As Duke said, we're seeing a large number of large diameter pipe projects moving into the last half of the year, and that's what's bringing us up into that overall margin profile in the back half of the year. Relative to longer-term, that's what it is. It's the continuing contribution of robust amount of large diameter pipe. There's a bit of primary driver moving us towards that range. And as it relates to a '17, '18, '19 view, we're not going to speak to anything from a guidance perspective. But what I would say is that when you look at the back half of this year and see how that complement is contributing so much to the margin profile that continues to be, we'll give us the confidence overall of being able to move towards that is historical 9% to 12% range."

So my concern -- I guess, my concern is that's a big number. How much cushion do you have in that? Can you still make the low end of those 2 main line pipe jobs that you're waiting on permitting if they get pushed? And then my second question is on the -- you've got 2 nice projects on the large transmission side and backlog, which I think you said is another $500 million. Given that we're seeing the large transmission projects ramp again, why can't margins, as we approach 2017, get back to your targeted range of the 10% to 12%. Because your commentary historically has been well small transmission and distribution, so that's why your margins were there. Are those 2 projects so competitively bid, that's off the table. The third question is you talked about receivables being pushed or something and you expect to get that back in the third quarter. Can you just give us color and how much of that is and why is a new customer pay union? Is it a dispute over project or is it they can't? Just a little more color there."

Duke spoke of earlier that we're not going to look at that as individualisolation because there's of remaining work might execute above our expedition and therefore, be able to cover any shortfall our operation that revenue. The if we execute at the current level of the projects that are based upon our guidance and that project fully moves out, I think that what you see is we probably need to come back and look at some level of adjustment but it's too soon to say. As it stands here today, what we have in our expectations for the year based upon the probability that we believe we have to move forward based upon our customer competition is something changes from that, we will let you know. Relative to the T&D margins.
The reality is as we stand here today, the biggest pressure in that area is coming from downturn of the market in Canada. If you were to look at just the noncanadian operations, the margins in that segment are, as well as ignoring the power plant, if you will. The remaining margins are at our historical margin profile what is putting the pressure overall on the electric power group is it margins coming out of Canada. To that end, that is where, as we move forward, we're going to have 2 of the large or the 2 large projects that the company's and the been awarded. We believe will be moving into full construction in 2017 and we would expect that alone to create a substantial for the margin upside in Canada, which would relieve some of the pressure you're seeing overall in the margin. So we are seeing our ability to operate in our historical profile in the noncanadian market as it stands here today. That's what also gives us the confidence to be able to move that into that range as we move forward. That's what you'd see in backlog margin. Are comparable to what you've seen historically. We've not changed our bidding approach on any of the work that's out there that we are pursuing. So there's nothing otherwise fundamental occurring.
And then lastly, on your receivables question. It's QA QC type work or processes. I mean, all of the stuff, we have some substantial dollar amount that are being held up on very minor issues. And it's just a matter of getting that process of QA QC. There is anything that's in there that's unique. We've run into that periodically and we don't anticipate anything size or consequence to come out of the issue."

It's nothing relative to any expectations a recover of change orders and claims. It's really just a mix of work. And we're going to, in our mind, we're going to have an uptick on revenues very likely between the third quarter and fourth quarter, most of that being driven by the pipeline division itself in oil and gas and the larger diameter pipe. So will it be from higher revenue and the better absorption of the costs and/or just having the full complement of spreads moving at that point in time? And so largely, ultimately, the mix of the work that's happening is what's driving a little bit of that uptick. And we have seen fourth quarter margins be higher than the third quarter in the past.

It's just longer cycle for permitting and it has this in the past. Normal, natural gas was a fairly easy process with the states getting involved and that has created another level of complexity to get them permitted. We're all working through that. You're starting to see some permit go through. I do believe, as we move forward, that it will get ironed out. It always does. And we'll get things moving. So we're starting to understand a little better. As far as competitive level, some -- the work that we're looking at is core to what we're doing in our natural gas segment long-haul pipe.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offi",1679,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
The environment we have been operating in has been challenging for the first 6 months of the year. In particular, our Canadian operations continue to experience the effect of a down market. We continue to make necessary changes in our cost structure to adjust to the market conditions, and believe, we are on track to deliver on our expectations for the remaining 6 months of the year. However, the ongoing challenges on the power plant project in Alaska distort the overall performance of our core operations. 
As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we incurred additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska during the second quarter. Late in the quarter, during the late stages of the commissioning phase, the project experienced a claimed force majeure event. We have also experienced further deficiencies in third-party engineering, the cost changes to the planed scope of work as well as failures of other contractors operating on-site. The combination of these issues resulted in a significant increase in estimated cost to complete the project. We are in the early stages of developing estimates for potential recovery for the items from the customer and other parties.
I am fully aware that we have been discussing the losses on this project for the last year, and we take the issue seriously. We are all disappointed that we have incurred additional losses on this project and with the performance of the project overall. We remain focused on completing the project. While our core electric segment performance in the quarter was solid, the power plant losses in the second quarter were not previously contemplated in our guidance. And as a result, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect this impact. We continued to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment and remain focused on restoring our operating income margins for the segment to historical levels.
We continue to believe Quanta's market-leading position, coupled with industry dynamics such as: an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing, newer, more demand in government regulations should provide opportunities for our core transmission and distribution operations to grow. We will continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while remaining nimble to capitalize on large multiyear project opportunities that develop, as evidenced by the 2 large electric project awards announced this morning.
In June, Quanta was chosen by a Midwest utility to construct a new 100-mile, double-circuit 345-kilovolt transmission line in its service territory. Our scope of work includes access roads, foundations, steel pole erection, wire stringing and material management. Construction began in late June and the project is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018. 
Incremental to electric power backlog at the end of the second quarter is the large electric transmission and distribution project awarded to us by a California-based utility that we signed a contract for in July. Our scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of this project, including rebuilding and replacing approximately 145 miles of 12 and 69-kilovolt underground and overhead electric power infrastructure. Project is located in a national force area in Southern California. Engineering and related services for this project has begun and completion is anticipated in late 2019.
The aggregate contract value of these 2 projects is approximately $500 million. We continue to see substantial bidding activity and are pursuing a number of additional large, high-voltage electric transmission projects in both Canada and the United States. 
As the industry leader in providing solutions for large, high-voltage transmission projects, we believe Quanta is well positioned to capitalize on the project opportunities we see in the marketplace. Also, you may recall that several years ago, Quanta partnered with American Electric Power, or AEP, to upgrade approximately 240 miles of their 345-kilovolt transmission infrastructure in South Texas. The line remained in an energized state using our patent energized technologies. For this project in June, AEP won the Edison Electric Institute's 2016 Edison award's, the electric power industry's most prestigious honor. Quanta is proud to have partnered with AEP, and we appreciate the confidence they placed in us to provide them with a safe, innovative and cost-effective infrastructure solution.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins in the second quarter were softer than anticipated, primarily due to permitting delays on several large pipeline projects in our backlog, and to a lesser extent, due to certain negative project additions. As discussed on prior earnings calls, we expect improved performance for the segment, as we move through the year with the second half of the year, a meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. 
In the second quarter, 3 of our large-diameter pipeline projects were waiting for client authorization to commence work. The authorizations were contingent upon the customers receiving certain government permits, which have taken longer to obtain and have pushed anticipated construction start dates from the second quarter of this year to the third quarter.
We have since received authorization to begin work on one of the projects, and believe we can complete the project within our original estimates for the year. For the remaining projects, communications with our customers indicate that work is probable to move forward in the third quarter, which is what is reflected in our current guidance. While project delays generate headlines and the impact of timing project starts, we believe that on a macro level, such delays, coupled with the healthy and market drivers and strong demand for our large pipeline project services, could yield an active pipeline market that could prove to be a longer and more consistent rather than a relatively short boom and bust cycle. And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes in natural gas to those facilities.
While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. The large pipeline market remains very active. We continue to work with our customers on large, additional pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. While some projects are experiencing permitting environmental delays, others are successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and all are progressing forward. The bidding and negotiating environment is robust and the majority of our project opportunities in the United States continue to be driven by natural gas. In addition, we are experiencing increasing and ongoing levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada.
Regarding some of the other services we provide in our base business that are reflected in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, demand continues for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services, and we believe there are attractive growth opportunities for many years. 
Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market, as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate. As expected, our midstream gathering activities are down meaningfully first prior years. This is primarily due to the lack of takeaway capacity to move natural gas out of the production areas in the Marcellus and Utica shales to market and lower commodity prices for natural gas liquids. Challenging conditions in Canada, due to low oil prices, have also impacted our midstream gathering business. However, we believe that this market is beginning to stabilize. 
In summary, we continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and believe, we are all well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers. As discussed in our prior calls, we believed the first half of this year could be choppy, and it was. However, we expect a significant increase in activity levels and improve financial results in the second half of the year, which is supported by a strong backlog. In addition, we believe market conditions for our Canadian Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services operations have stabilized and that those markets are in early stages of recovery. 
We believe consolidation among our customers in both the electric utility and pipeline industries will be positive for Quanta going forward. As our customers get larger, they are continuing to partner with Quanta because of our scope and scale, innovative solutions and strong financial position. We are also seeing the convergence of the electric utility in natural gas pipeline, which we anticipated years ago and are well positioned to benefit from. Looking forward, in market drivers, our entrepreneurial business model, having the best field leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace and position us to critique to grow our core business over time.
We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large, high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium-term, and a large pipeline project market remains robust with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. This management team is focused on operating the business for the long term. We will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,378244077,1025341,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6",2336,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6 million or 11% per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $32 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release was $0.18 for the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2015.
Although Duke commented a bit on some of the items impacting our results for the quarter, I'll provide some additional commentary before discussing the detailed financial review. As pointed out in today's earnings release, the power plant construction project in Alaska negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $30.5 million in project losses or $0.12 per diluted share. At quarter end, this project had a contract value at $201 million and was approximately 90% complete. This project is expected to be substantially completed near the end of the third quarter of 2016. As this project continues to the final commissioning phases, it is possible that additional unforeseen circumstances or other performance issues could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project, however, our current estimates represent all issues known at this time.
The year-to-date project losses on the power plant are $51.8 million or $31.6 million net of tax and $0.20 per diluted share, and has impacted the year-to-date electric power segment operating margins by approximately 220 basis points. We are in the process of developing claims related to these losses that resulted during and even prior to the second quarter. However, we have not reflected any damage recovery in our estimates of total project loss.
Our results for the quarter were also negatively impacted by certain other items that were outside of our previous expectations. As Duke spoke of, we had lower overall reported revenues versus our expectations, which had a corresponding adverse impact on gross profit, driven largely by shifts in the timing of the start date on certain large-diameter pipeline projects, and to a lesser extent, a negative impact associated with the wildfires in Alberta, Canada. 
Additionally, we had some slight over hedges in cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, some of which we will be seeking to recover through future change orders, but otherwise negatively impacted the quarter by around $0.02. 
Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter and year is higher than anticipated due to the current estimate of the mix of our annual earnings being more heavily weighted to domestic rather than foreign operations, as well as the effects of a reduction in expected tax benefits from foreign restructurings, which were originally expected to benefit the entire year, but now won't be a benefit until the third quarter. These tax items impacted the quarter by approximately $0.02.
Turning to a broader discussion of our quarter-over-quarter results. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with the decrease in larger electric transmission and larger-diameter pipeline projects, as customers continue to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements from state and federal agencies and more stringent permitting processes. This increased regulatory environment impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other necessary infrastructure projects, which has had a corresponding negative impact on the level of demand for our services. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $40 million in revenues, generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.2% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.2% in the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from larger electric transmission projects and larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins. In addition, the higher cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, as compared to last quarter and the lack of corresponding change orders on these costs, impacted margin comparability.
Gross margins were also impacted by losses on the power plant project to $30.5 million in the quarter, which compares to $25.1 million of losses during the 3 months ended June 30, 2015 related to the same power plant project and an electric transmission project in Canada. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $6.7 million as compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was a result of $2.8 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development efforts and $2.2 million in incremental G&A costs associated with the acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 8.7% in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2015. This increase was due to the slightly higher G&A costs, as well as the reduced revenues for the second quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.16 billion, reflecting a decrease of $63.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.2%. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by continued regulatory constraint on the volume and timing of customer spending as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which included higher levels of revenues from larger transmission projects that were nearing completion.
Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted second quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $8 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 6.6% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned reduced revenues from larger electric transmission projects and a corresponding increase in lower margin revenues from smaller scale transmission work. In addition, margins are negatively impacted by certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the quarter as we continue to bear certain costs to ensure we are positioned to execute on larger transmission opportunities.
As I mentioned previously, operating margins for the second quarters of both 2016 and 2015 were negatively impacted by project losses on 1 or 2 large projects. As of June 30, 2016, 12 months backlog to the electric power segment was relatively flat and total backlog decreased slightly when compared to March 31, 2016, due to normal contract burn being effectively offset by new contract awards. Backlog, as of quarter-end, does not reflect the large California transmission and distribution project announcement included in today's release.
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $16.7 million or 2.6% to $633.3 million in the second quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of the fluctuations in large project timing I spoke of earlier. Segment revenues contributed by international operations were also negatively impacted by approximately $6 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased activity from distribution services as well as the contribution of approximately $10 million of revenues from acquired companies.
Operating income to the oil and gas segment, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 1.9% in 2Q '16 from 5.5% in 2Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins as well as a higher contribution from distribution services, which typically carry a lower margin profile. 
Also negatively impacting operating income were higher costs associated with challenging site conditions on an ongoing transmission project in Canada and a customer request for additional project closeout efforts on a U.S. transmission project that was substantially completed in 2015. While we intend to pursue change orders for additional compensation from our customers for certain of these items, no portion of these amounts have been included in our estimates of contract value as of quarter-end. 12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $47.8 million or 1.9%, and total backlog decreased $273.7 million or 7.4% when compared to March 31, 2016. These decreases were due to burn of backlog partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts.
Corporate and nonallocated costs decreased $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2Q '15, primarily as a result of lower acquisition and integration costs due to the timing of acquisitions. For the second quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $66.5 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $55.7 million, resulting in approximately $10.8 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $51.4 million for the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the less favorable operating results.
Cash flows from operations for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, provided approximately $266.3 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $98.3 million, resulting in approximately $168 million of year-to-date free cash flow. 
Despite fairly strong year-to-date free cash flow, unbilled production hung up in the approval process with a few customers has kept our working capital requirements a bit higher. We expect to see some resolution to these billing delays during the third quarter. However, the ramp-up of the large-diameter pipeline work in the latter half of the year is expected to be a use of cash. So it remains difficult to estimate the overall free cash flow for the year.
DSOs were 74 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 85 days at June 30, 2015. At quarter end, we had approximately $162.3 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had about $317.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $398 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.26 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.75 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a 3% decline year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher-end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment.
As it relates to seasonality, we continue to expect in market increase in revenues and margins as we move into the third quarter, largely driven by the timing of our large-diameter pipeline work. Additionally, due to some of the project timing issues that Duke spoke of earlier, we believe the fourth quarter revenues may not decline as we have seen with typical seasonality in the past, but instead will likely increase when compared to this year's third quarter. For 2016, we believe the electric power segment operating margins should be around 8% with the year-to-date losses of the power plant at $51.8 million having a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points on the overall operating margin for the segment.
We still see the oil and gas segment margins coming in between 5.5% and 7% for the year. But due to the lower margins seen in the first and second quarter of 2016, the upper end may be more challenging. Also, due to the revenue shifts mentioned earlier, margins in the oil and gas segment are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. 
Our outlook includes estimates for project start dates that we believe are probable based on customer communications. However, variances in these estimated start dates could lead to revenue and earnings results that may be materially different from our current estimates. In addition, some of these projects are larger in contract value, such as the performance of any individual project that significantly exceeds or is less in our current estimates could also impact our earnings results materially.
Lastly, our outlook does not assume any recovery of the project losses recognized to date on the power plant project even though the company is pursuing various remedies for recovery.
We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $17 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be around 39.5%. The third and fourth quarter rates will be around 38.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 157.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.
We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.20 and $1.35 and contemplate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.52 and $1.67. I believe it is important to note that had it not been for the incremental impact of the second quarter loss from the power plant project in Alaska, our previous annual guidance would have remained unchanged.
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta's stock.

When you think about the last half of the year ago though, in order for us to get into those upper -- the margin range that we're talking about overall for oil and gas, it's going to require that the third and fourth quarters have margins that are much more substantial than the first half. But those margins will be very near our historical margin guidance. We've often guided oil and gas as having the opportunity to be in the 9% to 12% range based upon the complement of contributions of large-diameter pipe. As Duke said, we're seeing a large number of large-diameter pipe projects moving into the last half of the year, and that's what's bringing us up into that overall margin profile in the back half of the year. Relative to the longer term, that's what it is. It's the continuing contribution of robust amount of large-diameter pipe, is a bit of primary driver moving us towards that range. And as it relates to a '17, '18, '19 view, we're not going to speak to anything from a guidance perspective. But what I would say is that when you look at the back half of this year and see how that complement is contributing so much to the margin profile that continues to be -- will gives us the confidence overall of being able to move towards that historical 9% to 12% range."

The back half of the year, the non-GAAP guidance adjusting for all the charges implies EPS in the back half of the year, $0.55 to $0.60 a quarter, which I don't know when we've ever seen Quanta put up those types of numbers. So my concern -- I guess, my concern is that's a big number. How much cushion do you have in that? Can you still make the low end if those 2 mainline pipe jobs that you're waiting on permitting if they get pushed? And then my second question is on the -- you've got 2 nice projects on the large transmission side and backlog, which I think you said is another $500 million. Given that we're seeing the large transmission projects ramp again, why can't margins, as we approach 2017, get back to your targeted range of the 10% to 12%. Because your commentary historically has always been world's small transmission and distribution, so that's why your margins were there. Over those 2 projects so competitively bid, that's off the table. The third question is you talked about receivables being pushed or something and you expect to get that back in the third quarter. Can you just give us color and how much that is? And why isn't your customer paying you? Is it a dispute over a project or is it they can't? Just a little more color there."

Duke spoke of earlier that we're not going to look at that as individual isolation because the rest -- remaining work might execute above our expedition, and therefore, be able to cover any shortfall of our push in that revenue. If we execute at the current level on the projects that are based upon our guidance and that project fully moves out, I think that what you'd see is we probably need to come back and look at some level of adjustment but it's too soon to say. As it stands here today, what we have in our expectations for the year based upon the probability that we believe we'll be able to move forward based upon our customer communications. If something changes from that move, we will let you know. Relative to the T&D margins, the reality is as we stand here today, the biggest pressure in that area is coming from downturn of the market in Canada. If you were to look at just the non-Canadian operations, the margins in that segment are -- as well as ignoring the power plant, if you will, the remaining margins are at our historical margin profile. What is putting the pressure overall on the Electric Power Group is, it's margins coming out of Canada. To that end, that is where, as we move forward, we're going to have 2 of the largest -- the 2 largest projects the company had ever been awarded. We believe will be moving into full construction in 2017, and we would expect that alone to create a potential for the margin upside in Canada, which would relieve some of the pressure you're seeing overall in the margin. So we are seeing our ability to operate in our historical profile in the non-Canadian market as we stand here today. That's what also then gives us the confidence being able to move into that range as we move forward. What you'd see in backlog margins, are comparable to what you've seen historically. We've not changed our bidding approach on any of the work that's out there that we are pursuing. So there's nothing otherwise fundamental occurring.  And then lastly, on your receivables question. It's QA/QC type work or processes. I mean, all of the stuff, we have some substantial dollar amounts in sales that are being held up on very minor issues. And it's just a matter of getting that process of QA/QC. There isn't anything that's there that's unique. We run into that periodically, and we don't anticipate anything size or consequence to come out of the issue."

I think what I was trying to accomplish is to tell you that overall, in general, some of these projects are complicated, both on gas and electric when we put them in the backlog and referenced Northern Pass. So that's complicated. And as we move through that process with our customer, which we stay in contact with all the time and they bid into their RFP process. When they get into those to proceed at their RFP process, then obviously, we'll stick that in backlog and give you some dates on when we're going to be in construction. It's still moving forward as expected. Should see something in late '17, everything we can hear from our customer and then possibly move it into construction, if they win. So as we know, we'll put them in backlog. Some of the other merger transmission, we follow it all. We're involved in all of them at some form or fashion for the most part. And again, when they become something that we can talk about meaningfully, we'll do that. We do not include any of these in our -- the way we think about the business until we put them in backlog. So we're not thinking about that as we look forward in the business, so we don't comment. That's not the reason for the margins moving in electric, for example.

It's nothing relative to any expectations of recovery of change orders and claims. It's really just the mix of work. I mean, we're going to -- in our mind, we're going to have an uptick on revenues very likely between the third quarter and fourth quarter, most of that being driven by the pipeline division itself in oil and gas and the larger-diameter pipe. So what it be from a higher revenue and a better absorption of the costs and/or just having the full complemented spreads moving at that point in time? And so largely, ultimately, the mix of the work that's happening is what's driving a little bit of that uptick. And we have seen fourth quarter margins be higher than the third quarter in the past. For us, our typical seasonality is that you have a little bit of weather effect in the fourth quarter, absent anything influencing that. In this particular case, what's influencing that is that large-diameter mix of work. That's why we think it'll have a slight margin uptick."

As we've said in our comments, I do think that the market in large pipeline is longer, and it's not a boom and bust type thing because everyone has continued to push of it. It's just a longer cycle for permitting than it has been in the past. And normally, natural gas work was a fairly easy process with the states getting involved and that has created another level of complexity to get them permitted. We're all working through that. You're starting to see some permit go through. I do believe, as we move forward, it will get ironed out, it always does. And we'll get things moving. So we're starting to understand a little better. As far as competitive level, some -- the work that we're looking at is a core to what we're doing in our natural gas segment long-haul pipe, and we're very well positioned in that market.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offi",1678,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
The environment we have been operating in has been challenging for the first 6 months of the year. In particular, our Canadian operations continue to experience the effects of a down market. We continue to make necessary changes in our cost structure to adjust to the market conditions and believe we are on track to deliver on our expectations for the remaining 6 months of the year. However, the ongoing challenges on the power plant project in Alaska distort the overall performance of our core operations. 
As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we incurred additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska during the second quarter. Late in the quarter, during the late stages of the commissioning phase, the project experienced a claimed force majeure event. We have also experienced further deficiencies in third-party engineering that caused changes to the planned scope of work as well as failures of other contractors operating on-site. The combination of these issues resulted in a significant increase in estimated cost to complete the project. We are in the early stages of developing estimates for potential recovery for the items from the customer and other parties.
I am fully aware that we have been discussing the losses on this project for the last year, and we take the issue seriously. We are all disappointed that we have incurred additional losses on this project and with the performance of the project overall. We remain focused on completing the project. While our core electric segment performance in the quarter was solid, the power plant losses in the second quarter were not previously contemplated in our guidance. And as a result, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect this impact. We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment and remain focused on restoring our operating income margins for the segment to historical levels.
We continue to believe Quanta's market-leading position, coupled with industry dynamics such as: an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing, newer, more demanding government regulations should provide opportunities for our core transmission and distribution operations to grow. We will continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while remaining nimble to capitalize on large multiyear project opportunities that develop, as evidenced by the 2 large electric project awards announced this morning.
In June, Quanta was chosen by a Midwest utility to construct a new 100-mile, double-circuit 345-kilovolt transmission line in its service territory. Our scope of work includes access roads, foundations, steel pole erection, wire stringing and material management. Construction began in late June, and the project is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018. 
Incremental to electric power backlog at the end of the second quarter is the large electric transmission and distribution project awarded to us by a California-based utility that we signed a contract for in July. Our scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of this project, including rebuilding and replacing approximately 145 miles of 12 and 69-kilovolt underground and overhead electric power infrastructure. Project is located in a national forest area in Southern California. Engineering and related services for this project has begun and completion is anticipated in late 2019.
The aggregate contract value of these 2 projects is approximately $500 million. We continue to see substantial bidding activity and are pursuing a number of additional large, high-voltage electric transmission projects in both Canada and the United States. 
As the industry leader in providing solutions for large, high-voltage transmission projects, we believe Quanta is well positioned to capitalize on the project opportunities we see in the marketplace. Also, you may recall that several years ago, Quanta partnered with American Electric Power, or AEP, to upgrade approximately 240 miles of their 345-kilovolt transmission infrastructure in South Texas. The line remained in an energized state using our patent energized technologies. For this project in June, AEP won the Edison Electric Institute's 2016 Edison award, the electric power industry's most prestigious honor. Quanta is proud to have partnered with AEP, and we appreciate the confidence they placed in us to provide them with a safe, innovative and cost-effective infrastructure solution.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins in the second quarter were softer than anticipated, primarily due to permitting delays on several large pipeline projects in our backlog, and to a lesser extent, due to certain negative project conditions. As discussed on prior earnings calls, we expect improved performance for the segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by a significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. 
In the second quarter, 3 of our large-diameter pipeline projects were waiting for client authorization to commence work. The authorizations were contingent upon the customer receiving certain government permits, which have taken longer to obtain and have pushed anticipated construction start dates from the second quarter of this year to the third quarter.
We have since received authorization to begin work on one of the projects, and believe we can complete the project within our original estimates for the year. For the remaining projects, communications with our customers indicate that work is probable to move forward in the third quarter, which is what is reflected in our current guidance. While project delays generate headlines and they impact the timing of project starts, we believe that on a macro level, such delays, coupled with the healthy end-market drivers and strong demand for our large pipeline project services, could yield an active pipeline market that could prove to be a longer and more consistent rather than a relatively short boom and bust cycle. And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities.
While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. The large pipeline market remains very active. We continue to work with our customers on large, additional pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. While some projects are experiencing permitting and environmental delays, others are successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and are progressing forward. The bidding and negotiating environment is robust and the majority of our project opportunities in the United States continue to be driven by natural gas. In addition, we are experiencing increasing and ongoing levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada.
Regarding some of the other services we provide in our base business that are reflected in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, demand continues for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services, and we believe there are attractive growth opportunities for many years. 
Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market, as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate. As expected, our midstream gathering activities are down meaningfully versus prior years. This is primarily due to the lack of takeaway capacity to move natural gas out of the production areas in the Marcellus and Utica shales to market and lower commodity prices for natural gas liquids. Challenging conditions in Canada, due to low oil prices, have also impacted our midstream gathering business. However, we believe that this market is beginning to stabilize. 
In summary, we continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and believe we are well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers. As discussed in our prior calls, we believed the first half of this year could be choppy, and it was. However, we expect a significant increase in activity levels and improved financial results in the second half of the year, which is supported by a strong backlog. In addition, we believe market conditions for our Canadian Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services operations have stabilized and that those markets are in the early stages of recovery. 
We believe consolidation among our customers in both the electric utility and pipeline industries will be positive for Quanta going forward. As our customers get larger, they are continuing to partner with Quanta because of our scope and scale, innovative solutions and strong financial position. We are also seeing the convergence of the electric utility and natural gas pipeline, which we anticipated years ago and are well positioned to benefit from. Looking forward, end-market drivers, our entrepreneurial business model, having the best field leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace and position us to continue to grow our core business over time.
We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large, high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium-term, and a large pipeline project market remains robust with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. This management team is focused on operating the business for the long term. We will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mind-set will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,378244077,1025704,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6",2334,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6 million or 11% per diluted share. These results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $32 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release was $0.18 for the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2015.
Although Duke commented a bit on some of the items impacting our results for the quarter, I'll provide some additional commentary before discussing the detailed financial review. As pointed out in today's earnings release, the power plant construction project in Alaska negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $30.5 million in project losses or $0.12 per diluted share. At quarter end, this project had a contract value at $201 million and was approximately 90% complete. This project is expected to be substantially completed near the end of the third quarter of 2016. As this project continues through the final commissioning phases, it is possible that additional unforeseen circumstances or other performance issues could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project, however, our current estimates represent all issues known at this time.
The year-to-date project losses on the power plant are $51.8 million or $31.6 million net of tax and $0.20 per diluted share, and have impacted the year-to-date electric power segment operating margins by approximately 220 basis points. We are in the process of developing claims related to these losses that resulted during and even prior to the second quarter. However, we have not reflected any damage recovery in our estimates of total project loss.
Our results for the quarter were also negatively impacted by certain other items that were outside of our previous expectations. As Duke spoke of, we had lower overall reported revenues versus our expectations, which had a corresponding adverse impact on gross profit, driven largely by shifts in the timing of the start date on certain large-diameter pipeline projects, and to a lesser extent, a negative impact associated with the wildfires in Alberta, Canada. 
Additionally, we had some slight overages in cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, some of which we will be seeking to recover through future change orders, but otherwise negatively impacted the quarter by around $0.02. 
Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter and year is higher than anticipated due to the current estimate of the mix of our annual earnings being more heavily weighted to domestic rather than foreign operations, as well as the effect of a reduction in expected tax benefits from foreign restructurings, which were originally expected to benefit the entire year, but now won't be a benefit until the third quarter. These tax items impacted the quarter by approximately $0.02.
Turning to a broader discussion of our quarter-over-quarter results. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with the decrease in larger electric transmission and larger-diameter pipeline projects, as customers continue to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements from state and federal agencies and more stringent permitting processes. This increased regulatory environment impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other necessary infrastructure projects, which has had a corresponding negative impact on the level of demand for our services. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $40 million in revenues, generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.2% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.2% in the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from larger electric transmission projects and larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins. In addition, the higher cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, as compared to last quarter and the lack of corresponding change orders on these costs, impacted margin comparability.
Gross margins were also impacted by losses on the power plant project of $30.5 million in the quarter, which compares to $25.1 million of losses during the 3 months ended June 30, 2015 related to the same power plant project and an electric transmission project in Canada. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $6.7 million as compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was a result of $2.8 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development efforts and $2.2 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.7% in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2015. This increase was due to the slightly higher G&A costs, as well as the reduced revenues for the second quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.16 billion, reflecting a decrease of $63.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.2%. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by continued regulatory constraint on the volume and timing of customer spending as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which included higher levels of revenues from larger transmission projects that were nearing completion.
Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted second quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $8 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 6.6% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned reduced revenues from larger electric transmission projects and a corresponding increase in lower margin revenues from smaller scale transmission work. In addition, margins are negatively impacted by certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the quarter as we continue to bear certain costs to ensure we are positioned to execute on larger transmission opportunities.
As I mentioned previously, operating margins for the second quarters of both 2016 and 2015 were negatively impacted by project losses on 1 or 2 large projects. As of June 30, 2016, 12 months backlog to the electric power segment was relatively flat and total backlog decreased slightly when compared to March 31, 2016, due to normal contract burn being effectively offset by new contract awards. Backlog, as of quarter-end, does not reflect the large California transmission and distribution project announcement included in today's release.
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $16.7 million or 2.6% to $633.3 million in the second quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of the fluctuations in large project timing I spoke of earlier. Segment revenues contributed by our international operations were also negatively impacted by approximately $6 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased activity from distribution services as well as the contribution of approximately $10 million of revenues from acquired companies.
Operating income to the oil and gas segment, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 1.9% in 2Q '16 from 5.5% in 2Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins as well as a higher contribution from distribution services, which typically carry a lower margin profile. 
Also negatively impacting operating income were higher costs associated with challenging site conditions on an ongoing transmission project in Canada and a customer request for additional project closeout efforts on a U.S. transmission project that was substantially completed in 2015. While we intend to pursue change orders for additional compensation from our customers for certain of these items, no portion of these amounts have been included in our estimates of contract value as of quarter-end. 12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $47.8 million or 1.9%, and total backlog decreased $273.7 million or 7.4% when compared to March 31, 2016. These decreases were due to burn of backlog, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts.
Corporate and nonallocated costs decreased $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2Q '15, primarily as a result of lower acquisition and integration costs due to the timing of acquisitions. For the second quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $66.5 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $55.7 million, resulting in approximately $10.8 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $51.4 million for the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the less favorable operating results.
Cash flows from operations for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 provided approximately $266.3 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $98.3 million, resulting in approximately $168 million of year-to-date free cash flow. 
Despite fairly strong year-to-date free cash flow, unbilled production hung up in the approval process with a few customers has kept our working capital requirements a bit higher. We expect to see some resolution to these billing delays during the third quarter. However, the ramp-up of the large-diameter pipeline work in the latter half of the year is expected to be a use of cash. So it remains difficult to estimate the overall free cash flow for the year.
DSOs were 74 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 85 days at June 30, 2015. At quarter end, we had approximately $162.3 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had about $317.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $398 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.26 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.75 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a 3% decline year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher-end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment.
As it relates to seasonality, we continue to expect a market increase in revenues and margins as we move into the third quarter, largely driven by the timing of large-diameter pipeline work. Additionally, due to some of the project timing issues that Duke spoke of earlier, we believe the fourth quarter revenues may not decline as we have seen with typical seasonality in the past, but instead will likely increase when compared to this year's third quarter. For 2016, we believe the electric power segment operating margins should be around 8% with the year-to-date losses of the power plant of $51.8 million having a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points on the overall operating margin for the segment.
We still see the oil and gas segment margins coming in between 5.5% and 7% for the year. But due to the lower margins seen in the first and second quarter of 2016, the upper end may be more challenging. Also, due to the revenue shifts mentioned earlier, margins in the oil and gas segment are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. 
Our outlook includes estimates for project start dates that we believe are probable based on customer communications. However, variances in these estimated start dates could lead to revenue and earnings results that may be materially different from our current estimates. In addition, some of these projects are larger in contract value, such that the performance of any individual project that significantly exceeds or is less than our current estimates could also impact our earnings results materially.
Lastly, our outlook does not assume any recovery of the project losses recognized to date on the power plant project even though the company is pursuing various remedies for recovery.
We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $17 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be around 39.5%. The third and fourth quarter rates will be around 38.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 157.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.
We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.20 and $1.35 and contemplate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.52 and $1.67. I believe it is important to note that had it not been for the incremental impact of the second quarter loss from the power plant project in Alaska, our previous annual guidance would have remained unchanged.
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta's stock.

And we understand that business very well. The power plant was not something it was core to us, and it has distorted our results, and we have not executed well on it, as you've seen. We also have claims on that job that we have not pursued, and we will. So the -- and also in the pipeline, I would say, again, we're very proud of the management team we have.

I know part of this is just some extra noise in the first half. But it looks like the potential that bigger permitting delays will just be a part of this cycle. What does your '16 guidance say about Quanta's ability to get oil and gas margins back to the longer-term goal of 9% to 12% margin in this segment? And can margin potentially just be structurally lower this cycle given some of the issues that you've mentioned in your gathering business and maybe some continuing issues in Canada?"

It's just saying that relative to 5.5% to 7%, posting a 7% for the year might be a little bit more difficult because of the pressure in the first half of the year. When you think about the last half of the year ago though, in order for us to get into those upper -- the margin ranges that we're talking about overall for oil and gas, it's going to require that the third and fourth quarters have margins that are much more substantial than the first half. But those margins will be very near our historical margin guidance. We've often guided oil and gas as having the opportunity to be in the 9% to 12% range based upon the complement of contributions of large-diameter pipe. As Duke said, we're seeing a large number of large-diameter pipe projects moving into the last half of the year, and that's what's bringing us up into that overall margin profile in the back half of the year. Relative to the longer term, that's what it is. It's the continuing contribution of robust amount of large-diameter pipe. This would be the primary driver moving us towards that range. And as it relates to a '17, '18, '19 view, we're not going to speak to anything from a guidance perspective. But what I would say is that when you look at the back half of this year and see how that complement is contributing so much to the margin profile: that continues to be what gives us the confidence overall of being able to move towards that historical 9% to 12% range."

The back half of the year, the non-GAAP guidance adjusting for all the charges implies EPS in the back half of the year of $0.55 to $0.60 a quarter, which I don't know when we've ever seen Quanta put up those types of numbers. So my concern -- I guess, my concern is, is that's a big number. How much cushion do you have in that? Can you still make the low end if those 2 mainline pipe jobs that you're waiting on permitting, if they get pushed? And then my second question is on the -- you've got the 2 nice projects on the large transmission side in backlog, which I think you said is another $500 million. Given that we're seeing the large transmission projects ramp again, why can't margins, as we approach 2017, get back to your targeted range of the 10% to 12%? Because your commentary, historically, has always been, well, it's small transmission and distribution, so that's why your margins were there. Or were those 2 projects so competitively bid, that's off the table? The third question is you talked about receivables being pushed or something and you expect to get that back in the third quarter. Can you just give us color on how much that is? And why isn't your customer paying you? Is it a dispute over a project or is it they can't? Just a little more color there."

Duke spoke of earlier that we're not going to look at that as individual isolation because the rest -- remaining work might execute above our expectations, and therefore, be able to cover any shortfall of a push in that revenue. If we execute at the current level on the projects that are based upon our guidance and that project fully moves out, I think that what you'd see is we'd probably need to come back and look at some level of adjustment. But it's too soon to say. As it stands here today, what we have in our expectations for the year are based upon the probability that we believe we'll be able to move forward based upon our customer communications. If something changes from that, we would let you know. Relative to the T&D margins, the reality is, is as we stand here today, the biggest pressure in that area is coming from downturn of the market in Canada. If you were to look at just the non-Canadian operations, the margins in that segment are -- as well as ignoring the power plant, if you will, the remaining margins are at our historical margin profile. What is putting the pressure overall on the Electric Power Group is, it's margins coming out of Canada. To that end, that is where, as we move forward, we're going to have 2 of the largest -- or the 2 largest projects the company has ever been awarded. We believe we'll be moving into full construction in 2017, and we would expect that alone to create a potential for the margin upside in Canada, which would relieve some of the pressure you're seeing overall in the margin. So we are seeing our ability to operate in our historical profile in the non-Canadian market as we stand here today. That's what also then gives us the confidence being able to move into that range as we move forward. What you would see in backlog margins, are comparable to what you've seen historically. We've not changed our bidding approach on any of the work that's out there that we are pursuing. So there's nothing otherwise fundamental occurring. And then lastly, on your receivables question. It's QA/QC type work or processes. I mean, all of the stuff, we have some substantial dollar amounts in sales [ph] that are being held up on very minor issues. And it's just a matter of getting that process of QA/QC. There isn't anything that's there that's unique. We've run into that periodically, and we don't anticipate anything of size or consequence to come out of the issue."

It's all about when they go and when we can come in and say, yes, we're going to start this project. It's not about the environment itself. It's a good environment as far as I'm concerned."

It's still moving forward as expected. Should see something in late '17, everything we can hear from our customer and then possibly move it into construction, if they win.

It's nothing relative to any expectations of recovery of change orders and claims. It's really just the mix of work. I mean, we're going to -- in our mind, we're going to have an uptick on revenues very likely between the third quarter and fourth quarter, most of that being driven by the pipeline division itself in oil and gas and the larger-diameter pipe. So whether it be from a higher revenue and a better absorption of the costs and/or just having the full complement of spreads moving at that point in time. And so largely, ultimately, the mix of the work that's happening is what's driving a little bit of that uptick. And we have seen fourth quarter margins be higher than the third quarter in the past, throughout. For us, our typical seasonality is that you have a little bit of weather effect in the fourth quarter, absent anything influencing that. In this particular case, what's influencing that is that large-diameter mix of work. That's why we think it'll have a slight margin uptick."

As we've said in our comments, I do think that the market in large pipeline is longer, and it's not a boom and bust type thing because everyone has continued to push a bit. It's just a longer cycle for permitting than it has been in the past. And normally, on natural gas FERC was a fairly easy process. With the states getting involved in that it has created another level of complexity to get them permitted. We're all working through that. You're starting to see some permits go through. I do believe, as we move forward, it will get ironed out, it always does. And we'll get things moving. So we're starting to understand that a little better. As far as competitive level, some -- the work that we're looking at is a core to what we doing in our natural gas segment long-haul pipe, and we're very well positioned in that market.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offi",1678,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
The environment we have been operating in has been challenging for the first 6 months of the year. In particular, our Canadian operations continue to experience the effects of a down market. We continue to make necessary changes in our cost structure to adjust to the market conditions and believe we are on track to deliver on our expectations for the remaining 6 months of the year. However, the ongoing challenges on the power plant project in Alaska distort the overall performance of our core operations. 
As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we incurred additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska during the second quarter. Late in the quarter, during the late stages of the commissioning phase, the project experienced a claimed force majeure event. We have also experienced further deficiencies in third-party engineering that caused changes to the planned scope of work as well as failures of other contractors operating on-site. The combination of these issues resulted in a significant increase in estimated cost to complete the project. We are in the early stages of developing estimates for potential recovery for the items from the customer and other parties.
I am fully aware that we have been discussing the losses on this project for the last year, and we take the issue seriously. We are all disappointed that we have incurred additional losses on this project and with the performance of the project overall. We remain focused on completing the project. While our core electric segment performance in the quarter was solid, the power plant losses in the second quarter were not previously contemplated in our guidance. And as a result, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect this impact. We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment and remain focused on restoring our operating income margins for the segment to historical levels.
We continue to believe Quanta's market-leading position, coupled with industry dynamics such as: an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability; the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas; and the implementation of existing, newer, more demanding government regulations should provide opportunities for our core transmission and distribution operations to grow. We will continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while remaining nimble to capitalize on large multiyear project opportunities that develop, as evidenced by the 2 large electric project awards announced this morning.
In June, Quanta was chosen by a Midwest utility to construct a new 100-mile, double-circuit 345-kilovolt transmission line in its service territory. Our scope of work includes access roads, foundations, steel pole erection, wire stringing and material management. Construction began in late June, and the project is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018. 
Incremental to electric power backlog at the end of the second quarter is the large electric transmission and distribution project awarded to us by a California-based utility that we signed a contract for in July. Our scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of this project, including rebuilding and replacing approximately 145 miles of 12 and 69-kilovolt underground and overhead electric power infrastructure. Project is located in a national forest area in Southern California. Engineering and related services for this project has begun and completion is anticipated in late 2019.
The aggregate contract value of these 2 projects is approximately $500 million. We continue to see substantial bidding activity and are pursuing a number of additional large, high-voltage electric transmission projects in both Canada and the United States. 
As the industry leader in providing solutions for large, high-voltage transmission projects, we believe Quanta is well positioned to capitalize on the project opportunities we see in the marketplace. Also, you may recall that several years ago, Quanta partnered with American Electric Power, or AEP, to upgrade approximately 240 miles of their 345-kilovolt transmission infrastructure in South Texas. The line remained in an energized state using our patent energized technologies. For this project in June, AEP won the Edison Electric Institute's 2016 Edison award, the electric power industry's most prestigious honor. Quanta is proud to have partnered with AEP, and we appreciate the confidence they placed in us to provide them with a safe, innovative and cost-effective infrastructure solution.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues and margins in the second quarter were softer than anticipated, primarily due to permitting delays on several large pipeline projects in our backlog, and to a lesser extent, due to certain negative project conditions. As discussed on prior earnings calls, we expect improved performance for the segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by a significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions. 
In the second quarter, 3 of our large-diameter pipeline projects were waiting for client authorization to commence work. The authorizations were contingent upon the customer receiving certain government permits, which have taken longer to obtain and have pushed anticipated construction start dates from the second quarter of this year to the third quarter.
We have since received authorization to begin work on one of the projects, and believe we can complete the project within our original estimates for the year. For the remaining projects, communications with our customers indicate that work is probable to move forward in the third quarter, which is what is reflected in our current guidance. While project delays generate headlines and they impact the timing of project starts, we believe that on a macro level, such delays, coupled with the healthy end-market drivers and strong demand for our large pipeline project services, could yield an active pipeline market that could prove to be a longer and more consistent rather than a relatively short boom and bust cycle. And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities.
While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. The large pipeline market remains very active. We continue to work with our customers on large, additional pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. While some projects are experiencing permitting and environmental delays, others are successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and are progressing forward. The bidding and negotiating environment is robust and the majority of our project opportunities in the United States continue to be driven by natural gas. In addition, we are experiencing increasing and ongoing levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada.
Regarding some of the other services we provide in our base business that are reflected in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, demand continues for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services, and we believe there are attractive growth opportunities for many years. 
Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multiyear opportunities in the natural gas distribution market, as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate. As expected, our midstream gathering activities are down meaningfully versus prior years. This is primarily due to the lack of takeaway capacity to move natural gas out of the production areas in the Marcellus and Utica shales to market and lower commodity prices for natural gas liquids. Challenging conditions in Canada, due to low oil prices, have also impacted our midstream gathering business. However, we believe that this market is beginning to stabilize. 
In summary, we continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and believe we are well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers. As discussed in our prior calls, we believed the first half of this year could be choppy, and it was. However, we expect a significant increase in activity levels and improved financial results in the second half of the year, which is supported by a strong backlog. In addition, we believe market conditions for our Canadian Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services operations have stabilized and that those markets are in the early stages of recovery. 
We believe consolidation among our customers in both the electric utility and pipeline industries will be positive for Quanta going forward. As our customers get larger, they are continuing to partner with Quanta because of our scope and scale, innovative solutions and strong financial position. We are also seeing the convergence of the electric utility and natural gas pipeline, which we anticipated years ago and are well positioned to benefit from. Looking forward, end-market drivers, our entrepreneurial business model, having the best field leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace and position us to continue to grow our core business over time.
We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large, high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium-term, and a large pipeline project market remains robust with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. This management team is focused on operating the business for the long term. We will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mind-set will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,378244077,1026375,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6",2334,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6 million or 11% per diluted share. These results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $32 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release was $0.18 for the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2015.
Although Duke commented a bit on some of the items impacting our results for the quarter, I'll provide some additional commentary before discussing the detailed financial review. As pointed out in today's earnings release, the power plant construction project in Alaska negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $30.5 million in project losses or $0.12 per diluted share. At quarter end, this project had a contract value at $201 million and was approximately 90% complete. This project is expected to be substantially completed near the end of the third quarter of 2016. As this project continues through the final commissioning phases, it is possible that additional unforeseen circumstances or other performance issues could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project, however, our current estimates represent all issues known at this time.
The year-to-date project losses on the power plant are $51.8 million or $31.6 million net of tax and $0.20 per diluted share, and have impacted the year-to-date electric power segment operating margins by approximately 220 basis points. We are in the process of developing claims related to these losses that resulted during and even prior to the second quarter. However, we have not reflected any damage recovery in our estimates of total project loss.
Our results for the quarter were also negatively impacted by certain other items that were outside of our previous expectations. As Duke spoke of, we had lower overall reported revenues versus our expectations, which had a corresponding adverse impact on gross profit, driven largely by shifts in the timing of the start date on certain large-diameter pipeline projects, and to a lesser extent, a negative impact associated with the wildfires in Alberta, Canada. 
Additionally, we had some slight overages in cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, some of which we will be seeking to recover through future change orders, but otherwise negatively impacted the quarter by around $0.02. 
Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter and year is higher than anticipated due to the current estimate of the mix of our annual earnings being more heavily weighted to domestic rather than foreign operations, as well as the effect of a reduction in expected tax benefits from foreign restructurings, which were originally expected to benefit the entire year, but now won't be a benefit until the third quarter. These tax items impacted the quarter by approximately $0.02.
Turning to a broader discussion of our quarter-over-quarter results. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with the decrease in larger electric transmission and larger-diameter pipeline projects, as customers continue to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements from state and federal agencies and more stringent permitting processes. This increased regulatory environment impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other necessary infrastructure projects, which has had a corresponding negative impact on the level of demand for our services. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $40 million in revenues, generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 11.2% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.2% in the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from larger electric transmission projects and larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins. In addition, the higher cost on existing projects within the oil and gas segment, as compared to last quarter and the lack of corresponding change orders on these costs, impacted margin comparability.
Gross margins were also impacted by losses on the power plant project of $30.5 million in the quarter, which compares to $25.1 million of losses during the 3 months ended June 30, 2015 related to the same power plant project and an electric transmission project in Canada. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $6.7 million as compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was a result of $2.8 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development efforts and $2.2 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.7% in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2015. This increase was due to the slightly higher G&A costs, as well as the reduced revenues for the second quarter of 2016.
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.16 billion, reflecting a decrease of $63.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.2%. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by continued regulatory constraint on the volume and timing of customer spending as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which included higher levels of revenues from larger transmission projects that were nearing completion.
Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted second quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $8 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 6.6% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.2% in last year's second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned reduced revenues from larger electric transmission projects and a corresponding increase in lower margin revenues from smaller scale transmission work. In addition, margins are negatively impacted by certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the quarter as we continue to bear certain costs to ensure we are positioned to execute on larger transmission opportunities.
As I mentioned previously, operating margins for the second quarters of both 2016 and 2015 were negatively impacted by project losses on 1 or 2 large projects. As of June 30, 2016, 12 months backlog to the electric power segment was relatively flat and total backlog decreased slightly when compared to March 31, 2016, due to normal contract burn being effectively offset by new contract awards. Backlog, as of quarter-end, does not reflect the large California transmission and distribution project announcement included in today's release.
Oil and gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $16.7 million or 2.6% to $633.3 million in the second quarter of '16. This decrease is primarily a result of the fluctuations in large project timing I spoke of earlier. Segment revenues contributed by our international operations were also negatively impacted by approximately $6 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased activity from distribution services as well as the contribution of approximately $10 million of revenues from acquired companies.
Operating income to the oil and gas segment, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 1.9% in 2Q '16 from 5.5% in 2Q '15. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins as well as a higher contribution from distribution services, which typically carry a lower margin profile. 
Also negatively impacting operating income were higher costs associated with challenging site conditions on an ongoing transmission project in Canada and a customer request for additional project closeout efforts on a U.S. transmission project that was substantially completed in 2015. While we intend to pursue change orders for additional compensation from our customers for certain of these items, no portion of these amounts have been included in our estimates of contract value as of quarter-end. 12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $47.8 million or 1.9%, and total backlog decreased $273.7 million or 7.4% when compared to March 31, 2016. These decreases were due to burn of backlog, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts.
Corporate and nonallocated costs decreased $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2Q '15, primarily as a result of lower acquisition and integration costs due to the timing of acquisitions. For the second quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $66.5 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $55.7 million, resulting in approximately $10.8 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $51.4 million for the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the less favorable operating results.
Cash flows from operations for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 provided approximately $266.3 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $98.3 million, resulting in approximately $168 million of year-to-date free cash flow. 
Despite fairly strong year-to-date free cash flow, unbilled production hung up in the approval process with a few customers has kept our working capital requirements a bit higher. We expect to see some resolution to these billing delays during the third quarter. However, the ramp-up of the large-diameter pipeline work in the latter half of the year is expected to be a use of cash. So it remains difficult to estimate the overall free cash flow for the year.
DSOs were 74 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 85 days at June 30, 2015. At quarter end, we had approximately $162.3 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had about $317.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $398 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.26 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.75 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates electric power segment revenues ranging from a 3% decline year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher-end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the oil and gas segment.
As it relates to seasonality, we continue to expect a market increase in revenues and margins as we move into the third quarter, largely driven by the timing of large-diameter pipeline work. Additionally, due to some of the project timing issues that Duke spoke of earlier, we believe the fourth quarter revenues may not decline as we have seen with typical seasonality in the past, but instead will likely increase when compared to this year's third quarter. For 2016, we believe the electric power segment operating margins should be around 8% with the year-to-date losses of the power plant of $51.8 million having a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points on the overall operating margin for the segment.
We still see the oil and gas segment margins coming in between 5.5% and 7% for the year. But due to the lower margins seen in the first and second quarter of 2016, the upper end may be more challenging. Also, due to the revenue shifts mentioned earlier, margins in the oil and gas segment are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. 
Our outlook includes estimates for project start dates that we believe are probable based on customer communications. However, variances in these estimated start dates could lead to revenue and earnings results that may be materially different from our current estimates. In addition, some of these projects are larger in contract value, such that the performance of any individual project that significantly exceeds or is less than our current estimates could also impact our earnings results materially.
Lastly, our outlook does not assume any recovery of the project losses recognized to date on the power plant project even though the company is pursuing various remedies for recovery.
We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $17 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be around 39.5%. The third and fourth quarter rates will be around 38.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 157.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.
We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.20 and $1.35 and contemplate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.52 and $1.67. I believe it is important to note that had it not been for the incremental impact of the second quarter loss from the power plant project in Alaska, our previous annual guidance would have remained unchanged.
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta's stock.

It's just saying that relative to 5.5% to 7%, posting a 7% for the year might be a little bit more difficult because of the pressure in the first half of the year. When you think about the last half of the year ago though, in order for us to get into those upper -- the margin ranges that we're talking about overall for oil and gas, it's going to require that the third and fourth quarters have margins that are much more substantial than the first half. But those margins will be very near our historical margin guidance. We've often guided oil and gas as having the opportunity to be in the 9% to 12% range based upon the complement of contributions of large-diameter pipe. As Duke said, we're seeing a large number of large-diameter pipe projects moving into the last half of the year, and that's what's bringing us up into that overall margin profile in the back half of the year. Relative to the longer term, that's what it is. It's the continuing contribution of robust amount of large-diameter pipe. This would be the primary driver moving us towards that range. And as it relates to a '17, '18, '19 view, we're not going to speak to anything from a guidance perspective. But what I would say is that when you look at the back half of this year and see how that complement is contributing so much to the margin profile: that continues to be what gives us the confidence overall of being able to move towards that historical 9% to 12% range."

So my concern -- I guess, my concern is, is that's a big number. How much cushion do you have in that? Can you still make the low end if those 2 mainline pipe jobs that you're waiting on permitting, if they get pushed? And then my second question is on the -- you've got the 2 nice projects on the large transmission side in backlog, which I think you said is another $500 million. Given that we're seeing the large transmission projects ramp again, why can't margins, as we approach 2017, get back to your targeted range of the 10% to 12%? Because your commentary, historically, has always been, well, it's small transmission and distribution, so that's why your margins were there. Or were those 2 projects so competitively bid, that's off the table? The third question is you talked about receivables being pushed or something and you expect to get that back in the third quarter. Can you just give us color on how much that is? And why isn't your customer paying you? Is it a dispute over a project or is it they can't? Just a little more color there."

Duke spoke of earlier that we're not going to look at that as individual isolation because the rest -- remaining work might execute above our expectations, and therefore, be able to cover any shortfall of a push in that revenue. If we execute at the current level on the projects that are based upon our guidance and that project fully moves out, I think that what you'd see is we'd probably need to come back and look at some level of adjustment. But it's too soon to say. As it stands here today, what we have in our expectations for the year are based upon the probability that we believe we'll be able to move forward based upon our customer communications. If something changes from that, we would let you know. Relative to the T&D margins, the reality is, is as we stand here today, the biggest pressure in that area is coming from downturn of the market in Canada. If you were to look at just the non-Canadian operations, the margins in that segment are -- as well as ignoring the power plant, if you will, the remaining margins are at our historical margin profile. What is putting the pressure overall on the Electric Power Group is, it's margins coming out of Canada. To that end, that is where, as we move forward, we're going to have 2 of the largest -- or the 2 largest projects the company has ever been awarded. We believe we'll be moving into full construction in 2017, and we would expect that alone to create a potential for the margin upside in Canada, which would relieve some of the pressure you're seeing overall in the margin. So we are seeing our ability to operate in our historical profile in the non-Canadian market as we stand here today. That's what also then gives us the confidence being able to move into that range as we move forward. What you would see in backlog margins, are comparable to what you've seen historically. We've not changed our bidding approach on any of the work that's out there that we are pursuing. So there's nothing otherwise fundamental occurring. And then lastly, on your receivables question. It's QA/QC type work or processes. I mean, all of the stuff, we have some substantial dollar amounts in sales [ph] that are being held up on very minor issues. And it's just a matter of getting that process of QA/QC. There isn't anything that's there that's unique. We've run into that periodically, and we don't anticipate anything of size or consequence to come out of the issue."

As we move into construction on some of these larger projects, as stated, you'll start to see our margins increase. That's what you're seeing now. We're starting to get some of these larger projects and execute on them. So that will alleviate some of the margin pressure, and we're pretty optimistic about that moving forward. Our Canadian operations are depressed at this point. We do believe that's stabilized. As that starts to move forward again, the margins will move up, and we're watching that with cautious optimism in Canada. But I think there it's expected, and from our standpoint, we are executing good on what we have. The environment itself is robust. You can see it in the capital spends of our customers. It's all about when they go and when we can come in and say, yes, we're going to start this project. It's not about the environment itself. It's a good environment as far as I'm concerned."

I mean, we're going to -- in our mind, we're going to have an uptick on revenues very likely between the third quarter and fourth quarter, most of that being driven by the pipeline division itself in oil and gas and the larger-diameter pipe. So whether it be from a higher revenue and a better absorption of the costs and/or just having the full complement of spreads moving at that point in time. And so largely, ultimately, the mix of the work that's happening is what's driving a little bit of that uptick. And we have seen fourth quarter margins be higher than the third quarter in the past, throughout.

As we've said in our comments, I do think that the market in large pipeline is longer, and it's not a boom and bust type thing because everyone has continued to push a bit. It's just a longer cycle for permitting than it has been in the past. And normally, on natural gas FERC was a fairly easy process. With the states getting involved in that it has created another level of complexity to get them permitted. We're all working through that. You're starting to see some permits go through. I do believe, as we move forward, it will get ironed out, it always does. And we'll get things moving. So we're starting to understand that a little better. As far as competitive level, some -- the work that we're looking at is a core to what we doing in our natural gas segment long-haul pipe, and we're very well positioned in that market.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offic",1711,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
We are pleased with a solid third quarter results we reported this morning. Compared to the third quarter of last year, revenues increased approximately 5%, operating income and margins improved significantly and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations doubled.
We are committed to returning our operating margin to historical levels, and our third quarter results demonstrate progress towards that goal and the earnings potential of the company. We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog. I would note that our backlog does not yet include a couple of large projects we have announced, primarily due to their ongoing permitting process. We are confident that these projects will move forward, and we'll include them in the backlog when we get better visibility into mobilization.
Electric power segment revenues grew approximately 3% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, excluding the relatively small loss recognized on the Alaska power plant project in the quarter, our electric power segment operating income margins increased 10%. These results were driven by sound execution of our base electric power business. Of note, we had a nominal contribution from the startup of 2 larger electric transmission projects we discussed previously on our second quarter earnings call.
Regarding the Alaska power plant project. In early October, we met the contractual performance guarantees required under the contract and have moved into final punchlist completion phase, which is on schedule with the previous expectation. 
We continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while actively pursuing large multi-year transmission project opportunities. Based on the projects we are executing on and have in backlog, we will have large transmission project revenues should increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. These projects complement our day-to-day base business operations. 
In addition, we are in various stages of discussion and negotiations with customers on other large transmission projects that could be awarded over the coming quarters. But we remain cautious on the timing due to permitting uncertainty. 
The macro environment in Canada remains challenging for our electric power operations, but we are seeing some signs of recovery that could have a positive effect going forward we have taken steps over the past several quarters to adjust the cost structure of these operations. We are pleased with the progress and believe we are well positioned to increase profitability as the markets recover. 
We compete on our track record for safely executing projects on time and on budget, and we'll remain disciplined on pricing and project work risk. We're okay with not winning them all.
We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment. The end-market drivers underpinning the demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services are firmly in place and we believe will remain so for years to come. We expect our base electric power business to continue to grow over time, with larger high-voltage electric transmission projects creating opportunity for incremental growth, but with some cyclicality.
And finally, in October, hurricane Matthew hit the Southeast Coast of the United States, knocking out power to more than 4 million people along its path and significantly damaging property and infrastructure. Quanta deployed more than 1,700 power workers to assist utilities with restoring power to customers impacted by the hurricane. 
Quanta and the rest of the industry were able to quickly restore power, which reflects the benefits of system hardening initiatives that utilities invested in over the past several years. We believe these demonstrated system hardening benefits will continue to drive infrastructure replacement for years to come. 
Our employees safely responded to help others in need, and in many cases, put themselves in harm's way to do so. We have the best craftsmen in the world and they performed at the highest level during this event.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues increased more than 8% versus the same quarter last year and increased more than 29% sequentially. Of note, sequential operating margins increased considerably in the third quarter, primarily due to a significant increase in large pipeline project activity. We expect an improved performance for this segment as we move through 2016, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first, driven by significant increase in large pipeline contributions.
On our second quarter earnings conference call, we discussed 2 large natural gas pipeline projects that were awaiting final permitting before the customer could give us notice to proceed with construction. We began construction on the larger of the 2 projects, a large natural gas pipeline project in the Southeast United States, in mid-September and expect to complete construction in the first half of 2017. We have also begun initial construction activities on the second project, but now expect the majority of the pipeline construction activities to begin early next year rather than this year.
We are currently on construction of 10 large-diameter pipelines spread across North America and Australia. The vast majority of our current and future pipeline projects we see are designed to move natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to various demand centers, while a number of others are intended to support coal-to-gas generation switching efforts, increased local gas distribution demand, and further out, the movement of natural gas to the coastlines for LNG export. 
For example, in September, Dominion announced the Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC signed a contract with Spring Ridge Constructors LLC to build a proposed 600-mile natural gas Atlantic Coast pipeline. Sprin Ridge Constructors is a joint venture of leading pipeline construction companies, including Price Gregory International and Quanta Service Company. 
Pending approval by FERC, the Atlantic Coast pipeline would run from Harrison County, West Virginia to Robeson County, North Carolina. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2017 and completion is expected in the second half of 2019. This is a significant project for Quanta, and we are pleased to be part of the joint venture. Because the project is in the permitting and approval process, the project is not yet reflected in our backlog.
In addition, we are experiencing increased levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada. While some projects are encountering permitting and environmental delays, others have received the required government approvals and progressing forward. Despite a difficult regulatory environment, we continue to foresee an active pipeline market for the next several years.
Similar to our electric power segment, we have built and are strengthening the base business in our oil and gas segment, which consists of services such as natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering. 
We are positive on the long-term demand drivers for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services. Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multi-year opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as pipeline integrity programs continue to accelerate. We have been investing in this business and expanding our operations organically into new markets. 
We ended the quarter with nearly 28,200 employees, which is a record. And I expect our headcount will continue to increase over the coming quarters. Drafting, training and retaining the workforce we need to safely grow and expand our company and support our customers over the longer term is critical. The development of our world-class training facility in La Grange, Texas and our training programs at the facility are the cornerstones of these efforts. There's nothing like it in the industry, and we believe the facility and our training programs give us a competitive advantage.
In addition, we have established a business relationship and are developing a workforce development program with State University that provides students with a industry-leading curriculum, build experience and internships for engineering, construction and project management. We believe this relationship and program is an important step to ensuring we have the access to high-quality, well-trained individuals that will become the future of Quanta. In support of this initiative, Quanta has committed to endowment of $3 million, $2.3 million of which was contributed in the third quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter and expect the second half of the year to be significantly better than the first, driven by continued execution in our base business and larger electric and pipeline transmission projects that are ramping into construction.
While we are now expecting 2016 results to be in the lower end of our prior guidance, this is primarily due to delayed project starts, which should benefit us in 2017. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and we believe we remain well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers.
While we will provide our formal commentary in 2017 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by collaborative relationships with our customers which give us valuable insight into their multi-year infrastructure capital programs. We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium term and believe large pipeline project market remains robust, with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. 
As I hope you have taken away from my comments this morning, we are confident that we will finish the year strong and we are optimistic about the potential we see for 2017 and beyond.
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and we'll continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our third quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,407604907,1071742,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 m",1996,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $43.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.55 for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.30 for the third quarter of 2015.
We did have a few items impacting our results for the quarter. First, as Duke mentioned, we made the $2.3 million contribution to an endowment with Sam Houston State University. Also, we had a slight true-up for costs associated with the power plant project in Alaska that impacted the electric power segment by around $3 million. Lastly, our tax rate is quite a bit higher, partly due to a lower proportion of income before taxes from international jurisdictions which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates, largely driven by delays in our Latin American concession work pushing more of the low-tax income into 2017. Also, as part of filing our 2015 Federal tax return, we had changes in estimates related to amounts qualifying for the domestic manufacturing tax reduction. Against our original estimates, these items added up to approximately $0.05 to $0.06 for the quarter.
Turning to our broader results. The increase in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with an increase in the number and size of oil and gas projects that moved into full construction during 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for gas distribution services. Also contributing to these increases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 14.8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.1% in the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily associated with improved margins in our electric power segment, which I will discuss later in my prepared remarks.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, $164.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $18.6 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase was the result of $11.2 million in higher compensation expenses largely due to greater incentive compensation costs compared to the prior quarter. We accrue incentive compensation proportionate to the levels of income for the year, therefore, the third quarter of 2016 has a much higher level of accrual based on the higher operating income, as well as the proportion of income the quarter represents to 2016. 
In addition, we had $3.1 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives, the $2.3 million contribution to the endowment and $1 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies net of reduced acquisition costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2015. 
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.22 billion, reflecting an increase of $39.3 million when compared to last year's third quarter or approximately 3.3%. This increase was primarily due to approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 9.7% in the third quarter 2016 as compared to 6.5% in last year's third quarter. Our margins for the quarter took a slight hit for the power plant but otherwise reflected solid productivity across most of our electric operations.
Last year's third quarter was impacted by significant delays in larger transmission projects, which at the time, led to an increasingly competitive smaller transmission market because of excess transmission construction resources in the industry. We were also impacted during that timeframe, as we transitioned resources from larger projects to smaller projects. Although we continue to bear the cost of certain underutilized large transmission resources and pressure from a more competitive environment for transmission projects, specifically in some regions of Canada, we have adjusted certain of our costs for the anticipated market environment and are better managing transitions between our smaller transmission projects. 
On the Alaska power plant project, we are continuing the documentation process and related activities to support our claims and recovery efforts to recoup from various parties a portion of the losses previously recognized on the project. While we do not know how successful these efforts will be or the timing of any recovery, we have not recognized any loss recovery on the project to date or forecasted any current recovery. We do not expect to further update on this project or potential recoveries unless matters change materially.
As of September 30, 2016, 12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment increased 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively, when compared to June 30, 2016, due to new contract awards partially offset by normal contract burn. 
Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $63.5 million or 8.4% to $819.8 million in the third quarter of '16. This increase is primarily from an increase in the number of size of projects that moved into full construction in 3qQ3 '16 as well as increased customer spending for distribution services.
Also contributing to the increase was approximately $5 million of revenues from acquired companies. Operating income for the oil and gas segment, as a percentage of revenues, increased to 8% in 3Q '16 from 7.8% in 3Q '15 and increased significantly from 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 due to a higher revenues associate with large-diameter pipeline projects which typically carry higher margins.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $35.3 million or 1.4% and total backlog decreased $85.2 million or 2.5% when compared to June 30, 2016. These decreases were due to the timing of a large, as well as expected contract burn during the quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts. Corporate and unallocated costs were comparable quarter-over-quarter.
For the third quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations used approximately $69.3 million and net capital expenditures were $29 million, resulting in $98.4 million of negative free cash flows as compared to free cash flow of $69.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the increased working capital requirements associated with the significant increase in the number and size of oil and gas infrastructure projects that moved in full construction in 3Q '16.
In addition, last quarter, I made mention of some unbilled production that was moving slower than expected through the approval process but the customer that resulted in our current working capital balance being a bit higher. Although previous discussions with the customer senior management have proven promising on the amount of billing and collections we would achieve this quarter, the approval process has remained demanding and, in our opinion, at times beyond reasonable. Progress on the project overall has created a level of adjustments to the contract value, largely associated with unit adders, and as defined in the contracts, which have also contributed to a higher unbilled balance.
We have added personal demand from meticulous requirement that have been presented and subsequent to the quarter, have continued to receive positive comments from the customer for resolution. However, during the third quarter, these payment delays negatively affected our free cash flow. As of September, the accounts receivable and unbilled balances with this customer represented 11 days of our overall DSO position of 79 days, which compares to DSO of 85 days at September 30 of last year. DSOs are otherwise lower compared to last September due to more favorable upfront billing positions on other contracts.
Cash flows from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 provided approximately $196.9 million and net capital expenditures were $127.3 million, resulting in approximately $69.6 million of year-to-date free cash flow.
At quarter end, we had $117.4 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had $313.3 million of letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding and we have $479.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.13 billion in total liquidity as of September 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We have lowered our revenue expectations due to delays on several projects which has shifted revenue from 2016 to early 2017, primarily due to permitting delays as well as some delay due to the rainfall associated with hurricane Matthew. The slight reduction in revenue expectations has a corresponding impact on our earnings projection for the year and after considering the items I previously mentioned that impacted the third quarter, we now anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.17 and $1.22.
We also anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.51 and $1.56. Despite some of the project timing impacts, we continue to believe the fourth quarter will be our highest revenue quarter of the year at or near record levels for the company. Our current expectations are for electric power revenues to be comparable to last year's fourth quarter with consolidated revenue growth quarter-over-quarter being driven by the oil and gas segment. Although we expect to perform higher levels of storm work in the fourth quarter 2016, we still expect margins for the electric power segment to be in the low 8% range for the year. A significant number of the crews deployed to emergency restoration services associated with hurricane Matthew left existing customer work, and therefore, the net increase will be tempered. It is too soon to quantify the net effect of storm work as of today. Also, normal seasonality is expected to negatively impact fourth quarter margins for the segment.
Margins in the oil and gas segment are expected to be near 5.5% for the year. The storm work benefiting the electric power segment in October had a negative impact in the oil and gas segment, delaying start times on certain projects by a couple of weeks, which contributed to our overall lower revenue expectations.
Our margin expectations are still for these individual projects but the lower contributions to the quarter will somewhat offset the overall contributions of storm work to the consolidated quarter. We estimate that interest expense will approach $15 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for the year to be around 41.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 2016, we are assuming 157.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $205 million to $215 million and this compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
We are committed to attending our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which oceans of the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. We will continue to focus on the strong cash flow of our base business and concentrate on mitigating the more pronounced fluctuations in cash flow associated with a working capital requirements of larger projects. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures and organic growth with an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions and other strategic investments.
This concludes our formal presentation, and we will now open the line for Q&A.

So the underlying business will continue to grow and some of the larger projects will come in on top of that. And Canada, just a little bit on that. It's more dependent on your energy, on your oil and where oil pricing is. So it's really difficult for us to try to pin that down on where the larger projects are going. We have continued to get our cost structure in line with what the market is. We do have some nice projects in backlog that we believe will move forward in '17.

You've seen here in the third quarter that if you exclude the power plant, that we posted a number, it's effectively double-digit numbers in electric power segment. We talked about our ability to beat that back there. That is partly because of the cost control efforts in Canada, but it's also because of the strong margins in the U.S. The U.S. market, as it stands here today for 2016, we are executing as a double-digit margin profile. The pressure for the year is partly coming from MLP, obviously, but as well as some of the pressure associated with the Canadian market. But that's where our cost control efforts have predominantly been. And as we look forward, we can see the opportunity to be working on a couple of those larger projects in '17 so a combination of the cost control and those larger projects we think bode well for Canadian margins. At least to lessen the dilution that's currently being created by Canada.

Are there any headwinds that you know of today that would depress margins in '17 because, I mean, I'm just thinking we have Alaska, that's gone.

So as we get busier, as the projects -- the larger projects are there, we get better utilization. As we talked about in the past, we had people that were on the sidelines, they are now going to work on some of these larger projects or weren't as efficient on the smaller ones and so you'll start to see -- that's why you're starting to see some of the margin enhancement as well as our base business continues to grow. So that will allow some utilization there. And our Canadian operations, we have rightsized some of that and we'll move forward there. It's really about Canada for us on the margins to make sure that we get that in line. And some of the projects there, I would say, are out of our pricing discipline and will allow the others to win those and we'll continue to say disciplined on how we bid work.

But it's important to remember that, that's also our highest margin quarter, typically from a seasonality perspective. And so when you kind of model out how we think the fourth quarter is going to play, I think you're going to model out that you're going to see margins dropping below 10% in the electric power segment because of that seasonality. We think the seasonality will definitely be impacting the quarters of 2017. For the last few years, you've seen a lot less of that seasonal dynamic because of the contributions of Canada. But as we stand here today, you see lesser contributions of Canada both from volume perspective as well as because of the fact that the overall performance of Canada is contributing at a lower margin level. So although it's too soon to comment as exactly how guidance will play out, I think those are important factors to think about when you think about our ability to maintain double-digit margins in every quarter of '17. I think seasonal impacts will exist and so that will be putting some level of pressure in our ability be it at double digits throughout the year. Relative to oil and gas, it's a big factor as to when the individual projects starts and stops i individual quarters. Thinking about the second quarter commentary that we provided on the fourth quarter of this year, we talked about potential for the ability for margins to see an uptick. As we stand here today, we're not seeing that because of the timing of those projects. Those projects pushing out into the fourth quarter. So any of those individuals starts to top the project were much influenced the mix of the work in the quarters and therefore, for the year. And that's the biggest portion of what drives the level of margins being up in the double-digit range for oil and gas at this stage. Higher levels at given times in given quarters for those large-diameter pipe definitely give us ability to be there. But as Duke commentary talked about, to center yet comment how the back half of the real play out to be able to really feel out the ability to be a double-digit margins right now."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offic",1711,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
We are pleased with a solid third quarter results we reported this morning. Compared to the third quarter of last year, revenues increased approximately 5%, operating income and margins improved significantly and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations doubled.
We are committed to returning our operating margin to historical levels, and our third quarter results demonstrate progress towards that goal and the earnings potential of the company. We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog. I would note that our backlog does not yet include a couple of large projects we have announced, primarily due to their ongoing permitting process. We are confident that these projects will move forward, and we'll include them in the backlog when we get better visibility into mobilization.
Electric power segment revenues grew approximately 3% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, excluding the relatively small loss recognized on the Alaska power plant project in the quarter, our electric power segment operating income margins increased 10%. These results were driven by sound execution of our base electric power business. Of note, we had a nominal contribution from the startup of 2 larger electric transmission projects we discussed previously on our second quarter earnings call.
Regarding the Alaska power plant project. In early October, we met the contractual performance guarantees required under the contract and have moved into final punchlist completion phase, which is on schedule with the previous expectation. 
We continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while actively pursuing large multi-year transmission project opportunities. Based on the projects we are executing on and have in backlog, we will have large transmission project revenues should increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. These projects complement our day-to-day base business operations. 
In addition, we are in various stages of discussion and negotiations with customers on other large transmission projects that could be awarded over the coming quarters. But we remain cautious on the timing due to permitting uncertainty. 
The macro environment in Canada remains challenging for our electric power operations, but we are seeing some signs of recovery that could have a positive effect going forward we have taken steps over the past several quarters to adjust the cost structure of these operations. We are pleased with the progress and believe we are well positioned to increase profitability as the markets recover. 
We compete on our track record for safely executing projects on time and on budget, and we'll remain disciplined on pricing and project work risk. We're okay with not winning them all.
We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment. The end-market drivers underpinning the demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services are firmly in place and we believe will remain so for years to come. We expect our base electric power business to continue to grow over time, with larger high-voltage electric transmission projects creating opportunity for incremental growth, but with some cyclicality.
And finally, in October, hurricane Matthew hit the Southeast Coast of the United States, knocking out power to more than 4 million people along its path and significantly damaging property and infrastructure. Quanta deployed more than 1,700 power workers to assist utilities with restoring power to customers impacted by the hurricane. 
Quanta and the rest of the industry were able to quickly restore power, which reflects the benefits of system hardening initiatives that utilities invested in over the past several years. We believe these demonstrated system hardening benefits will continue to drive infrastructure replacement for years to come. 
Our employees safely responded to help others in need, and in many cases, put themselves in harm's way to do so. We have the best craftsmen in the world and they performed at the highest level during this event.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues increased more than 8% versus the same quarter last year and increased more than 29% sequentially. Of note, sequential operating margins increased considerably in the third quarter, primarily due to a significant increase in large pipeline project activity. We expect an improved performance for this segment as we move through 2016, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first, driven by significant increase in large pipeline contributions.
On our second quarter earnings conference call, we discussed 2 large natural gas pipeline projects that were awaiting final permitting before the customer could give us notice to proceed with construction. We began construction on the larger of the 2 projects, a large natural gas pipeline project in the Southeast United States, in mid-September and expect to complete construction in the first half of 2017. We have also begun initial construction activities on the second project, but now expect the majority of the pipeline construction activities to begin early next year rather than this year.
We are currently on construction of 10 large-diameter pipelines spread across North America and Australia. The vast majority of our current and future pipeline projects we see are designed to move natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to various demand centers, while a number of others are intended to support coal-to-gas generation switching efforts, increased local gas distribution demand, and further out, the movement of natural gas to the coastlines for LNG export. 
For example, in September, Dominion announced the Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC signed a contract with Spring Ridge Constructors LLC to build a proposed 600-mile natural gas Atlantic Coast pipeline. Spring Ridge Constructors is a joint venture of leading pipeline construction companies, including Price Gregory International and Quanta Service Company. 
Pending approval by FERC, the Atlantic Coast pipeline would run from Harrison County, West Virginia to Robeson County, North Carolina. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2017 and completion is expected in the second half of 2019. This is a significant project for Quanta, and we are pleased to be part of the joint venture. Because the project is in the permitting and approval process, the project is not yet reflected in our backlog.
In addition, we are experiencing increased levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada. While some projects are encountering permitting and environmental delays, others have received the required government approvals and progressing forward. Despite a difficult regulatory environment, we continue to foresee an active pipeline market for the next several years.
Similar to our electric power segment, we have built and are strengthening the base business in our oil and gas segment, which consists of services such as natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering. 
We are positive on the long-term demand drivers for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services. Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multi-year opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as pipeline integrity programs continue to accelerate. We have been investing in this business and expanding our operations organically into new markets. 
We ended the quarter with nearly 28,200 employees, which is a record. And I expect our headcount will continue to increase over the coming quarters. Drafting, training and retaining the workforce we need to safely grow and expand our company and support our customers over the longer term is critical. The development of our world-class training facility in La Grange, Texas and our training programs at the facility are the cornerstones of these efforts. There's nothing like it in the industry, and we believe the facility and our training programs give us a competitive advantage.
In addition, we have established a business relationship and are developing a workforce development program with State University that provides students with a industry-leading curriculum, build experience and internships for engineering, construction and project management. We believe this relationship and program is an important step to ensuring we have the access to high-quality, well-trained individuals that will become the future of Quanta. In support of this initiative, Quanta has committed to endowment of $3 million, $2.3 million of which was contributed in the third quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter and expect the second half of the year to be significantly better than the first, driven by continued execution in our base business and larger electric and pipeline transmission projects that are ramping into construction.
While we are now expecting 2016 results to be in the lower end of our prior guidance, this is primarily due to delayed project starts, which should benefit us in 2017. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and we believe we remain well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers.
While we will provide our formal commentary in 2017 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by collaborative relationships with our customers which give us valuable insight into their multi-year infrastructure capital programs. We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium term and believe large pipeline project market remains robust, with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. 
As I hope you have taken away from my comments this morning, we are confident that we will finish the year strong and we are optimistic about the potential we see for 2017 and beyond.
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and we'll continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our third quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,407604907,1071919,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 m",1995,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $43.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.55 for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.30 for the third quarter of 2015.
We did have a few items impacting our results for the quarter. First, as Duke mentioned, we made the $2.3 million contribution to an endowment with Sam Houston State University. Also, we had a slight true-up for costs associated with the power plant project in Alaska that impacted the electric power segment by around $3 million. Lastly, our tax rate is quite a bit higher, partly due to a lower proportion of income before taxes from international jurisdictions which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates, largely driven by delays in our Latin American concession work pushing more of the low-tax income into 2017. Also, as part of filing our 2015 Federal tax return, we had changes in estimates related to amounts qualifying for the domestic manufacturing tax reduction. Against our original estimates, these items added up to approximately $0.05 to $0.06 for the quarter.
Turning to our broader results. The increase in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with an increase in the number and size of oil and gas projects that moved into full construction during 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for gas distribution services. Also contributing to these increases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 14.8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.1% in the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily associated with improved margins in our electric power segment, which I will discuss later in my prepared remarks.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, $164.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $18.6 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase was the result of $11.2 million in higher compensation expenses largely due to greater incentive compensation costs compared to the prior quarter. We accrue incentive compensation proportionate to the levels of income for the year, therefore, the third quarter of 2016 has a much higher level of accrual based on the higher operating income, as well as the proportion of income the quarter represents to 2016. 
In addition, we had $3.1 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives, the $2.3 million contribution to the endowment and $1 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies net of reduced acquisition costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2015. 
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.22 billion, reflecting an increase of $39.3 million when compared to last year's third quarter or approximately 3.3%. This increase was primarily due to approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 9.7% in the third quarter 2016 as compared to 6.5% in last year's third quarter. Our margins for the quarter took a slight hit for the power plant but otherwise reflected solid productivity across most of our electric operations.
Last year's third quarter was impacted by significant delays in larger transmission projects, which at the time, led to an increasingly competitive smaller transmission market because of excess transmission construction resources in the industry. We were also impacted during that timeframe, as we transitioned resources from larger projects to smaller projects. Although we continue to bear the cost of certain underutilized large transmission resources and pressure from a more competitive environment for transmission projects, specifically in some regions of Canada, we have adjusted certain of our costs for the anticipated market environment and are better managing transitions between our smaller transmission projects. 
On the Alaska power plant project, we are continuing the documentation process and related activities to support our claims and recovery efforts to recoup from various parties a portion of the losses previously recognized on the project. While we do not know how successful these efforts will be or the timing of any recovery, we have not recognized any loss recovery on the project to date or forecasted any current recovery. We do not expect to further update on this project or potential recoveries unless matters change materially.
As of September 30, 2016, 12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment increased 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively, when compared to June 30, 2016, due to new contract awards partially offset by normal contract burn. 
Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $63.5 million or 8.4% to $819.8 million in the third quarter of '16. This increase is primarily from an increase in the number of size of projects that moved into full construction in 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for distribution services. Also contributing to the increase was approximately $5 million of revenues from acquired companies. 
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 8% in 3Q '16 from 7.8% in 3Q '15 and increased significantly from 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 due to higher revenues associate with large-diameter pipeline projects which typically carry higher margins.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $35.3 million or 1.4%, and total backlog decreased $85.2 million or 2.5% when compared to June 30, 2016. These decreases were due to the timing of awards, as well as expected contract burn during the quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts. 
Corporate and non-allocated costs were comparable quarter-over-quarter.
For the third quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations used approximately $69.3 million and net capital expenditures were $29 million, resulting in $98.4 million of negative free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of $69.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the increased working capital requirement associated with the significant increase in the number and size of oil and gas infrastructure projects that moved into full construction in 3Q '16.
In addition, last quarter, I made mention of some unbilled production that was moving slower than expected through the approval process with a customer that resulted in our current working capital balance being a bit higher. Although previous discussions with the customer's senior management had proven promising on the amount of billing and collections we would achieve this quarter, the approval process has remained demanding, and in our opinion, at times, beyond reason. Progress on the project overall has created a level of adjustments to the contract value, largely associated with unit adders, as defined in the contract, which have also contributed to a higher unbilled balance.
We have added personnel to manage the meticulous requirement that had been presented, and subsequent to the quarter, have continued to receive positive comments from the customer for resolution. However, during the third quarter, these payment delays negatively affected our free cash flow. As of September, the accounts receivable and unbilled balances with this customer represented 11 days of our overall DSO position of 79 days, which compares to DSO of 85 days at September 30 of last year. DSOs are otherwise lower compared to last September due to more favorable upfront billing positions on other contracts.
Cash flows from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, provided approximately $196.9 million and net capital expenditures were $127.3 million, resulting in approximately $69.6 million of year-to-date free cash flow.
At quarter end, we had $117.4 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had $313.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding, and we had $479.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.13 billion in total liquidity as of September 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We have lowered our revenue expectations due to delays on several projects, which has shifted revenue from 2016 to early 2017, primarily due to permitting delays as well as some delay due to the rainfall associated with hurricane Matthew. 
This slight reduction in revenue expectations has a corresponding impact on our earnings projection for the year. And after considering the items I previously mentioned that impacted the third quarter, we now anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.17 and $1.22. We also anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.51 and $1.56. 
Despite some of the project timing impacts, we continue to believe the fourth quarter will be our highest-revenue quarter of the year, at or near record levels for the company. Our current expectations are for electric power revenues to be comparable to last year's fourth quarter, with consolidated revenue growth quarter-over-quarter being driven by the oil and gas segment. 
Although we expect to perform higher levels of storm work in the fourth quarter of 2016, we still expect margins for the electric power segment to be in the low 8% range for the year. A significant number of the crews deployed to emergency restoration services associated with hurricane Matthew left existing customer work, and therefore, the net increase will be tempered. It is too soon to quantify the net effect of storm work as of today. Also, normal seasonality is expected to negatively impact fourth quarter margins for the segment.
Margins in the oil and gas segment are expected to be near 5.5% for the year. The storm work benefiting the electric power segment in October had a negative impact on the oil and gas segment, delaying start times on certain projects by a couple of weeks, which contributed to our overall lower revenue expectations. Our margin expectations are still on tack for these individual projects, but the lower contributions to the quarter will somewhat offset the overall contributions of storm work to the consolidated quarter. 
We estimate that interest expense will approach $15 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for the year to be around 41.5%. 
Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. 
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 2016, we are assuming 157.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $205 million to $215 million, and this compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
We are committed to attending our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which positions the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. We will continue to focus on the strong cash flow of our base business and concentrate on mitigating the more pronounced fluctuations in cash flow associated with the working capital requirements of larger projects. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures and organic growth, with an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions and other strategic investments.
This concludes our formal presentation, and we will now open the line for Q&A.

But the underpinning -- the underlying base business, as we'll continue to talk about, is good. There's demand there. We continue to grow that business. We're excited about it. As we stated, where headcounts higher, we continue to invest in our workforce. So we like -- we see the capital spends of our customers, we're talking to them daily, so we're able to understand where they're going. And we -- you can look at what they say on their earnings calls, and we believe the capital spends will increase over the next few years, especially that we could see. So the underlying business will continue to grow, with some of the larger projects will come in on top of that. And Canada, just a little bit on that. It's more dependent on your energy, on your oil and where your oil pricing is. So it's really difficult for us to try to pin that down on where the larger projects are going. We have continued to get our cost structure in line with what the market is. We do have some nice projects in backlog that we believe will move forward in '17.

You've seen here in the third quarter that if you exclude the power plant, that we posted a number that's effectively double-digit margins in electric power segment. We talked about our ability to beat it back there. That is partly because of the cost control efforts in Canada, but it's also because of the strong margins in the U.S. The U.S. market, as it stands here today for 2016, we are executing at the double-digit margin profile. The pressure for the year is partly coming from MLP, obviously, but as well as some of the pressure associated with the Canadian market. But that's where our cost control efforts have predominantly been. And as we look forward, we can see the opportunity to be working on a couple of those larger projects in '17. So a combination of the cost control and those larger projects, we think, bode well for Canadian margins, at least to lessen the dilution that's currently being created by Canada. But the U.S. market is still operating well, and we think we're very much focused on returning the Canadian margins to a greater benefit."

Are there any headwinds that you know of today that would depress margins in '17? Because, I mean, I'm just thinking we have Alaska, that's gone. We have Canada, which should be less of a headwind, you've restructured. I'm just -- I just don't understand why margins shouldn't be materially higher when we're thinking about '17 versus '16.

But I can tell you that from an overall Canada, for at least electric power, you're talking about low single-digit margins in comparison. The international revenues right now run about 15% of our consolidated revenues. That includes some Latin America and some Australia work. But from Canada, that gives you -- let's say that it's probably running in the 10% to 15% range. So you can kind of do some backwards math looking at the relative dilution. Oil and gas pushed to '17, quantifications, I would tell you that the largest portion of our revenue adjustment for the year is associated with those individual oil and gas projects. And then for margin guidance for '17, I can color first and just simply say that I think your assessment's not unfair. Mainly even if we just look at the elimination of MLP year-over-year, we don't know that we're going to see any sizable moves from a cost structure perspective, from a G&A perspective, so the rest is going to come down largely to execution and the timing of the projects.

So you've had some stuff that's pushed into the first half, sounds as if you're going to have a pretty big first half. Atlantic Coast isn't supposed to start until later in the year. So it sounds like there's the potential for a little bit of a sort of abnormal flow to the year with kind of an air pocket in the third quarter which would normally be the high-water mark for the year. Should we be thinking that, that's kind of the flow of the year, unless you pick up a project kind of in between Sabal Trail and other big stuff you're working on and when Atlantic Coast goes?"

Is there any reason -- kind of going back to what Jamie was asking earlier, is there any reason why you can't get into the 10% to 11% range in electrical next year? And then with oil and gas, the large-diameter stuff is the best-margin work you do. And I understand that there's probably drags from really low profit levels on more of the gathering work you're doing. But just sort of maybe, Derrick, if you can help us think through the moving pieces of all these segments.

And again, you exclude power plant, you saw margins that were in the 10% range. But it's important to remember that, that's also our highest-margin quarter typically from a seasonality perspective. And so when you ki",410,"Yes, so as it relates to this quarter. And again, you exclude power plant, you saw margins that were in the 10% range. But it's important to remember that, that's also our highest-margin quarter typically from a seasonality perspective. And so when you kind of model out how we think the fourth quarter is going to play, I think you're going to model out, that you're going to see margins dropping below 10% in the electric power segment because of that seasonality. We think that seasonality will definitely be impacting the quarters of 2017. For the last few years, you've seen a lot less of that seasonal dynamic because of the contributions of Canada. But as we stand here today, you see lesser contributions of Canada, both from a volume perspective as well as because of the fact that the overall performance of Canada is contributing at a lower margin level. So although it's too soon to comment as to exactly how guidance will play out, I think those are important factors to think about when you think about our ability to maintain double-digit margins in every quarter of '17. I think seasonal impacts will exist, and so that will be putting some level of pressure on our ability to be at that double digit throughout the year. Relative to oil and gas, it's a big factor as to when the individual projects start and stop in the individual quarters. Thinking about the second quarter commentary that we provided on the fourth quarter of this year, we talked about the potential for the ability of margins to see an uptick. As we stand here today, we're not seeing that because of the timing of those projects, some of those projects pushing out of the fourth quarter. So any of those individuals starts or stops of projects can very much influence the mix of the work in the quarters, and therefore, for the year. And that's the biggest portion of what drives our -- the level of margins being up in that double-digit range for oil and gas at this stage. Higher levels at given times in given quarters for those large-diameter pipe can definitely give us the ability to be there. But as Duke's commentary talked about, to soon to yet comment as to how the back half of the year will play out, to be able to really feel out the ability to be at double-digit margins right now."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offic",1716,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
We are pleased with a solid third quarter results we reported this morning. Compared to the third quarter of last year, revenues increased approximately 5%, operating income and margins improved significantly and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations doubled.
We are committed to returning our operating margins to historical levels, and our third quarter results demonstrate progress towards that goal and the earnings potential of the company. We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog. I would note that our backlog does not yet include a couple of large projects we have announced, primarily due to their ongoing permitting process. We are confident that these projects will move forward, and we'll include them in the backlog when we get better visibility into mobilization.
Electric power segment revenues grew approximately 3% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, excluding the relatively small loss recognized on the Alaska power plant project in the quarter, our electric power segment operating income margins increased 10%. These results were driven by sound execution of our base electric power business. Of note, we had a nominal contribution from the startup of 2 larger electric transmission projects we discussed previously on our second quarter earnings call.
Regarding the Alaska power plant project. In early October, we met the contractual performance guarantees required under the contract and have moved into final punch list completion phase, which is on schedule with the previous expectation. 
We continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while actively pursuing large multi-year transmission project opportunities. Based on the projects we are executing on and have in backlog, we will have large transmission project revenues should increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. These projects complement our day-to-day base business operations. 
In addition, we are in various stages of discussion and negotiations with customers on other large transmission projects that could be awarded over the coming quarters. But we remain cautious on the timing due to permitting uncertainty. 
The macro environment in Canada remains challenging for our electric power operations, but we are seeing some signs of recovery that could have a positive effect going forward we have taken steps over the past several quarters to adjust the cost structure of these operations. We are pleased with the progress and believe we are well positioned to increase profitability as the markets recover. 
We compete on our track record for safely executing projects on time and on budget, and we will remain disciplined on pricing and project work risk. We're okay with not winning them all.
We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment. The end-market drivers underpinning the demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services are firmly in place and we believe will remain so for years to come. We expect our base electric power business to continue to grow over time, with larger high-voltage electric transmission projects creating opportunity for incremental growth, but with some cyclicality.
And finally, in October, Hurricane Matthew hit the Southeast Coast of the United States, knocking out power to more than 4 million people along its path and significantly damaging property and infrastructure. Quanta deployed more than 1,700 power workers to assist utilities with restoring power to customers impacted by the hurricane. 
Quanta and the rest of the industry were able to quickly restore power, which reflects the benefits of system hardening initiatives that utilities invested in over the past several years. We believe these demonstrated system hardening benefits will continue to drive infrastructure replacement for years to come. 
Our employees safely responded to help others in need, and in many cases, put themselves in harm's way to do so. We have the best craftsmen in the world and they performed at the highest level during this event.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues increased more than 8% versus the same quarter last year and increased more than 29% sequentially. Of note, sequential operating margins increased considerably in the third quarter, primarily due to a significant increase in large pipeline project activity. We expect an improved performance for this segment as we move through 2016, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first, driven by a significant increase in large pipeline contributions.
On our second quarter earnings conference call, we discussed 2 large natural gas pipeline projects that were awaiting final permitting before the customer could give us notice to proceed with construction. We began construction on the larger of the 2 projects, a large natural gas pipeline project in the Southeast United States, in mid-September and expect to complete construction in the first half of 2017. We have also begun initial construction activities on the second project, but now expect the majority of the pipeline construction activities to begin early next year rather than this year.
We are currently on construction of 10 large-diameter pipelines spread across North America and Australia. The vast majority of our current and future pipeline projects we see are designed to move natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to various demand centers, while a number of others are intended to support coal-to-gas generation switching efforts, increased local gas distribution demand, and further out, the movement of natural gas to the coastlines for LNG export. 
For example, in September, Dominion announced the Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC signed a contract with Spring Ridge Constructors LLC to build a proposed 600-mile natural gas Atlantic Coast pipeline. Spring Ridge Constructors is a joint venture of leading pipeline construction companies, including Price Gregory International and Quanta Service Company. 
Pending approval by FERC, the Atlantic Coast pipeline would run from Harrison County, West Virginia to Robeson County, North Carolina. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2017 and completion is expected in the second half of 2019. This is a significant project for Quanta, and we are pleased to be part of the joint venture. Because the project is in the permitting and approval process, the project is not yet reflected in our backlog.
In addition, we are experiencing increased levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada. While some projects are encountering permitting and environmental delays, others have received the required government approvals and progressing forward. Despite a difficult regulatory environment, we continue to foresee an active pipeline market for the next several years.
Similar to our electric power segment, we have built and are strengthening the base business in our oil and gas segment, which consists of services such as natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering. 
We are positive on the long-term demand drivers for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services. Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multi-year opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as pipeline integrity programs continue to accelerate. We have been investing in this business and expanding our operations organically into new markets. 
We ended the quarter with nearly 28,200 employees, which is a record. And I expect our headcount will continue to increase over the coming quarters. Attracting, training and retaining the workforce we need to safely grow and expand our company and support our customers over the longer term is critical. The development of our world-class training facility in La Grange, Texas and our training programs at the facility are the cornerstone of these efforts. There's nothing like it in the industry, and we believe the facility and our training programs give us a competitive advantage.
In addition, we have established a business relationship and are developing a workforce development program with Sam Houston State University that provides students with an industry-leading curriculum, build experience and internships for engineering, construction and project management. We believe this relationship and program is an important step to ensuring we have the access to high-quality, well-trained individuals that will become the future of Quanta. In support of this initiative, Quanta has committed to endowment of $3 million, $2.3 million of which was contributed in the third quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter and expect the second half of the year to be significantly better than the first, driven by continued execution in our base business and larger electric and pipeline transmission projects that are ramping into construction.
While we are now expecting 2016 results to be in the lower end of our prior guidance, this is primarily due to delayed project starts, which should benefit us in 2017. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and we believe we remain well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers.
While we will provide our formal commentary and 2017 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by collaborative relationships with our customers which give us valuable insight into their multi-year infrastructure capital programs. We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium term and believe large pipeline project market remains robust, with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. 
As I hope you have taken away from my comments this morning, we are confident that we will finish the year strong and we are optimistic about the potential we see for 2017 and beyond.
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and we'll continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our third quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,407604907,1072912,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 m",1994,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $43.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.55 for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.30 for the third quarter of 2015.
We did have a few items impacting our results for the quarter. First, as Duke mentioned, we made the $2.3 million contribution to an endowment with Sam Houston State University. Also, we had a slight true-up for costs associated with the power plant project in Alaska that impacted the electric power segment by around $3 million. Lastly, our tax rate is quite a bit higher, partly due to a lower proportion of income before taxes from international jurisdictions which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates, largely driven by delays in our Latin American concession work pushing more of the low-tax income into 2017. Also, as part of filing our 2015 Federal tax return, we had changes in estimates related to amounts qualifying for the domestic manufacturing tax deduction. Against our original estimates, these items added up to approximately $0.05 to $0.06 for the quarter.
Turning to our broader results. The increase in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with an increase in the number and size of oil and gas projects that moved into full construction during 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for gas distribution services. Also contributing to these increases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 14.8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.1% in the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily associated with improved margins in our electric power segment, which I will discuss later in my prepared remarks.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, $164.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $18.6 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase was the result of $11.2 million in higher compensation expenses largely due to greater incentive compensation costs compared to the prior quarter. We accrue incentive compensation proportionate to the levels of income for the year, therefore, the third quarter of 2016 has a much higher level of accrual based on the higher operating income, as well as the proportion of income the quarter represents to 2016. 
In addition, we had $3.1 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives, the $2.3 million contribution to the endowment and $1 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies net of reduced acquisition costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2015. 
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.22 billion, reflecting an increase of $39.3 million when compared to last year's third quarter or approximately 3.3%. This increase was primarily due to approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 9.7% in the third quarter 2016 as compared to 6.5% in last year's third quarter. Our margins for the quarter took a slight hit for the power plant but otherwise reflected solid productivity across most of our electric operations.
Last year's third quarter was impacted by significant delays in larger transmission projects, which at the time, led to an increasingly competitive smaller transmission market because of excess transmission construction resources in the industry. We were also impacted during that timeframe, as we transitioned resources from larger projects to smaller projects. Although we continued to bear the cost of certain underutilized large transmission resources and pressure from a more competitive environment for transmission projects, specifically in some regions of Canada, we have adjusted certain of our costs for the anticipated market environment and are better managing transitions between our smaller transmission projects. 
On the Alaska power plant project, we are continuing the documentation process and related activities to support our claims and recovery efforts to recoup from various parties a portion of the losses previously recognized on the project. While we do not know how successful these efforts will be or the timing of any recovery, we have not recognized any loss recovery on the project to date or forecasted any current recovery. We do not expect to further update on this project or potential recoveries unless matters change materially.
As of September 30, 2016, 12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment increased 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively, when compared to June 30, 2016, due to new contract awards partially offset by normal contract burn. 
Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $63.5 million or 8.4% to $819.8 million in the third quarter of '16. This increase is primarily from an increase in the number of size of projects that moved into full construction in 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for distribution services. Also contributing to the increase was approximately $5 million of revenues from acquired companies. 
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 8% in 3Q '16 from 7.8% in 3Q '15 and increased significantly from 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 due to higher revenues associate with large-diameter pipeline projects which typically carry higher margins.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $35.3 million or 1.4%, and total backlog decreased $85.2 million or 2.5% when compared to June 30, 2016. These decreases were due to the timing of awards, as well as expected contract burn during the quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts. 
Corporate and non-allocated costs were comparable quarter-over-quarter.
For the third quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations used approximately $69.3 million and net capital expenditures were $29 million, resulting in $98.4 million of negative free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of $69.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the increased working capital requirement associated with the significant increase in the number and size of oil and gas infrastructure projects that moved into full construction in 3Q '16.
In addition, last quarter, I made mention of some unbilled production that was moving slower than expected through the approval process with a customer that resulted in our current working capital balance being a bit higher. Although previous discussions with the customer's senior management had proven promising on the amount of billing and collections we would achieve this quarter, the approval process has remained demanding, and in our opinion, at times, beyond reason. Progress on the project overall has created a level of adjustments to the contract value, largely associated with unit adders, as defined in the contract, which have also contributed to a higher unbilled balance.
We have added personnel to manage the meticulous requirements that had been presented, and subsequent to the quarter, have continued to receive positive comments from the customer for resolution. However, during the third quarter, these payment delays negatively affected our free cash flow. As of September, the accounts receivable and unbilled balances with this customer represented 11 days of our overall DSO position of 79 days, which compares to DSO of 85 days at September 30 of last year. DSOs are otherwise lower compared to last September due to more favorable upfront billing positions on other contracts.
Cash flows from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, provided approximately $196.9 million and net capital expenditures were $127.3 million, resulting in approximately $69.6 million of year-to-date free cash flow.
At quarter end, we had $117.4 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had $313.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding, and we had $479.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.13 billion in total liquidity as of September 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We have lowered our revenue expectations due to delays on several projects, which has shifted revenue from 2016 to early 2017, primarily due to permitting delays as well as some delay due to the rainfall associated with Hurricane Matthew. 
This slight reduction in revenue expectations has a corresponding impact on our earnings projection for the year. And after considering the items I previously mentioned that impacted the third quarter, we now anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.17 and $1.22. We also anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.51 and $1.56. 
Despite some of the project timing impacts, we continue to believe the fourth quarter will be our highest-revenue quarter of the year, at or near record levels for the company. Our current expectations are for electric power revenues to be comparable to last year's fourth quarter, with consolidated revenue growth quarter-over-quarter being driven by the oil and gas segment. 
Although we expect to perform higher levels of storm work in the fourth quarter of 2016, we still expect margins for the electric power segment to be in the low 8% range for the year. A significant number of the crews deployed to emergency restoration services associated with Hurricane Matthew left existing customer work, and therefore, the net increase will be tempered. It is too soon to quantify the net effect of storm work as of today. Also, normal seasonality is expected to negatively impact fourth quarter margins for the segment.
Margins in the oil and gas segment are expected to be near 5.5% for the year. The storm work benefiting the electric power segment in October had a negative impact on the oil and gas segment, delaying start times on certain projects by a couple of weeks, which contributed to our overall lower revenue expectations. Our margin expectations are still intact for these individual projects, but the lower contributions to the quarter will somewhat offset the overall contributions of storm work to the consolidated quarter. 
We estimate that interest expense will approach $15 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for the year to be around 41.5%. 
Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. 
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 2016, we are assuming 157.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $205 million to $215 million, and this compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
We are committed to attending our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which positions the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. We will continue to focus on the strong cash flow of our base business and concentrate on mitigating the more pronounced fluctuations in cash flow associated with the working capital requirements of larger projects. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures and organic growth, with an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions and other strategic investments.
This concludes our formal presentation, and we will now open the line for Q&A.

So the underlying business will continue to grow, with some of the larger projects will come in on top of that. 
And Canada, just a little bit on that. It's more dependent on your energy -- on your oil and where your oil pricing is. So it's really difficult for us to try to pin that down on where the larger projects are going. We have continued to get our cost structure in line with what the market is.

You've seen here in the third quarter that if you exclude the power plant, that we're posting a number that's effectively double-digit margins in electric power segment. We talked about our ability to beat it back there. That is partly because of the cost control efforts in Canada, but it's also because of the strong margins in the U.S. The U.S. market, as it stands here today for 2016, we are executing at the double-digit margin profile. The pressure for the year is partly coming from MLP, obviously, but as well as some of the pressure associated with the Canadian market. But that's where our cost control efforts have predominantly been. And as we look forward, we can see the opportunity to be working on a couple of those larger projects in '17. So a combination of the cost control and those larger projects, we think, bode well for Canadian margins, at least to lessen the dilution that's currently being created by Canada. But the U.S. market is still operating well, and we think we're very much focused on returning the Canadian margins to a greater benefit."

And my real question is, Derrick or Duke, whoever wants to answer this, are there -- I understand you don't want to give specific margin guidance for 2017, but are there any headwinds that we don't -- we can make our own assumptions on the market. Are there any headwinds that you know of today that would depress margins in '17? Because, I mean, I'm just thinking we have Alaska, that's gone. We have Canada, which should be less of a headwind, you've restructured. I'm just -- I just don't understand why margins shouldn't be materially higher when we're thinking about '17 versus '16.

The international revenues right now run about 15% of our consolidated revenues. That includes some Latin America and some Australia work. But from Canada, that gives you -- let's say that it's probably running in the 10% to 15% range. So you can kind of do some backwards math looking at the relative dilution. 
Oil and gas pushed to '17, quantification, I would tell you that the largest portion of our revenue adjustment for the year is associated with those individual oil and gas projects. 
And then for margin guidance for '17, I can color first and just simply say that I think your assessment's not unfair. Mainly even if we just look at the elimination of MLP year-over-year, we don't know that we're going to see any sizable moves from a cost structure perspective, from a G&A perspective, so the rest of it is going to come down largely to execution and the timing of the project.

And I understand that there's probably drags from really low profit levels on more of the gathering work you're doing.

And so when you ki",413,"Yes, so as it relates to this quarter. And again, you exclude power plant, you saw margins that were in the 10% range. But it's important to remember that, that's also our highest-margin quarter typically from a seasonality perspective. And so when you kind of model out how we think the fourth quarter is going to play out, I think you're going to model out, that you're going to see margins dropping below 10% in the electric power segment because of that seasonality. We think that seasonality will definitely be impacting the quarters of 2017. For the last few years, you've seen a lot less of that seasonal dynamic because of the contributions of Canada. But as we stand here today, you see lesser contributions of Canada, both from a volume perspective as well as because of the fact that the overall performance of Canada is contributing at a lower margin level. 
So although it's too soon to comment as to exactly how guidance will play out, I think those are important factors to think about when you think about our ability to maintain double-digit margins in every quarter of '17. I think seasonal impacts will exist, and so that will be putting some level of pressure on our ability to be at that double digit throughout the year. 
Relative to oil and gas, it's a big factor as to when the individual projects start and stop in the individual quarters. Thinking about the second quarter commentary that we provided on the fourth quarter of this year, we talked about the potential for the ability of margins to see an uptick. As we stand here today, we're not seeing that because of the timing of those projects, some of those projects pushing out of the fourth quarter. So any of those individual starts or stops of projects can very much influence the mix of the work in the quarters, and therefore, for the year. And that's the biggest portion of what drives our -- the level of margins being up in that double-digit range for oil and gas at this stage. Higher levels at given times in given quarters for those large-diameter pipe can definitely give us the ability to be in there. But as Duke's commentary talked about, it's too soon to yet comment as to how the back half of the year will play out, to be able to really feel out the ability to be at double-digit margins right now."

And yes, we are looking at large projects on a broad spectrum, both in Canada, Australia and the U.S. and always have on the front end of these projects. So the environment is good, as I've said. The underpinning demand's there. There's a need for natural gas all across the Lower 48, Canada, just from the power plant side. As the coal-to-gas switching happens, you start to see the LDC use more natural gas. We're bullish on the pipe business for the foreseeable feature here."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Offic",1716,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
We are pleased with a solid third quarter results we reported this morning. Compared to the third quarter of last year, revenues increased approximately 5%, operating income and margins improved significantly and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations doubled.
We are committed to returning our operating margins to historical levels, and our third quarter results demonstrate progress towards that goal and the earnings potential of the company. We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog. I would note that our backlog does not yet include a couple of large projects we have announced, primarily due to their ongoing permitting process. We are confident that these projects will move forward, and we'll include them in the backlog when we get better visibility into mobilization.
Electric power segment revenues grew approximately 3% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, excluding the relatively small loss recognized on the Alaska power plant project in the quarter, our electric power segment operating income margins increased 10%. These results were driven by sound execution of our base electric power business. Of note, we had a nominal contribution from the startup of 2 larger electric transmission projects we discussed previously on our second quarter earnings call.
Regarding the Alaska power plant project. In early October, we met the contractual performance guarantees required under the contract and have moved into final punch list completion phase, which is on schedule with the previous expectation. 
We continue to build our base transmission and distribution business while actively pursuing large multi-year transmission project opportunities. Based on the projects we are executing on and have in backlog, we will have large transmission project revenues should increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. These projects complement our day-to-day base business operations. 
In addition, we are in various stages of discussion and negotiations with customers on other large transmission projects that could be awarded over the coming quarters. But we remain cautious on the timing due to permitting uncertainty. 
The macro environment in Canada remains challenging for our electric power operations, but we are seeing some signs of recovery that could have a positive effect going forward we have taken steps over the past several quarters to adjust the cost structure of these operations. We are pleased with the progress and believe we are well positioned to increase profitability as the markets recover. 
We compete on our track record for safely executing projects on time and on budget, and we will remain disciplined on pricing and project work risk. We're okay with not winning them all.
We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment. The end-market drivers underpinning the demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services are firmly in place and we believe will remain so for years to come. We expect our base electric power business to continue to grow over time, with larger high-voltage electric transmission projects creating opportunity for incremental growth, but with some cyclicality.
And finally, in October, Hurricane Matthew hit the Southeast Coast of the United States, knocking out power to more than 4 million people along its path and significantly damaging property and infrastructure. Quanta deployed more than 1,700 power workers to assist utilities with restoring power to customers impacted by the hurricane. 
Quanta and the rest of the industry were able to quickly restore power, which reflects the benefits of system hardening initiatives that utilities invested in over the past several years. We believe these demonstrated system hardening benefits will continue to drive infrastructure replacement for years to come. 
Our employees safely responded to help others in need, and in many cases, put themselves in harm's way to do so. We have the best craftsmen in the world and they performed at the highest level during this event.
Turning to our oil and gas segment. Revenues increased more than 8% versus the same quarter last year and increased more than 29% sequentially. Of note, sequential operating margins increased considerably in the third quarter, primarily due to a significant increase in large pipeline project activity. We expect an improved performance for this segment as we move through 2016, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first, driven by a significant increase in large pipeline contributions.
On our second quarter earnings conference call, we discussed 2 large natural gas pipeline projects that were awaiting final permitting before the customer could give us notice to proceed with construction. We began construction on the larger of the 2 projects, a large natural gas pipeline project in the Southeast United States, in mid-September and expect to complete construction in the first half of 2017. We have also begun initial construction activities on the second project, but now expect the majority of the pipeline construction activities to begin early next year rather than this year.
We are currently on construction of 10 large-diameter pipelines spread across North America and Australia. The vast majority of our current and future pipeline projects we see are designed to move natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to various demand centers, while a number of others are intended to support coal-to-gas generation switching efforts, increased local gas distribution demand, and further out, the movement of natural gas to the coastlines for LNG export. 
For example, in September, Dominion announced the Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC signed a contract with Spring Ridge Constructors LLC to build a proposed 600-mile natural gas Atlantic Coast pipeline. Spring Ridge Constructors is a joint venture of leading pipeline construction companies, including Price Gregory International and Quanta Service Company. 
Pending approval by FERC, the Atlantic Coast pipeline would run from Harrison County, West Virginia to Robeson County, North Carolina. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2017 and completion is expected in the second half of 2019. This is a significant project for Quanta, and we are pleased to be part of the joint venture. Because the project is in the permitting and approval process, the project is not yet reflected in our backlog.
In addition, we are experiencing increased levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada. While some projects are encountering permitting and environmental delays, others have received the required government approvals and progressing forward. Despite a difficult regulatory environment, we continue to foresee an active pipeline market for the next several years.
Similar to our electric power segment, we have built and are strengthening the base business in our oil and gas segment, which consists of services such as natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering. 
We are positive on the long-term demand drivers for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services. Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multi-year opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as pipeline integrity programs continue to accelerate. We have been investing in this business and expanding our operations organically into new markets. 
We ended the quarter with nearly 28,200 employees, which is a record. And I expect our headcount will continue to increase over the coming quarters. Attracting, training and retaining the workforce we need to safely grow and expand our company and support our customers over the longer term is critical. The development of our world-class training facility in La Grange, Texas and our training programs at the facility are the cornerstone of these efforts. There's nothing like it in the industry, and we believe the facility and our training programs give us a competitive advantage.
In addition, we have established a business relationship and are developing a workforce development program with Sam Houston State University that provides students with an industry-leading curriculum, build experience and internships for engineering, construction and project management. We believe this relationship and program is an important step to ensuring we have the access to high-quality, well-trained individuals that will become the future of Quanta. In support of this initiative, Quanta has committed to endowment of $3 million, $2.3 million of which was contributed in the third quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter and expect the second half of the year to be significantly better than the first, driven by continued execution in our base business and larger electric and pipeline transmission projects that are ramping into construction.
While we are now expecting 2016 results to be in the lower end of our prior guidance, this is primarily due to delayed project starts, which should benefit us in 2017. We continue to have a positive multiyear view on the end markets we serve, and we believe we remain well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers.
While we will provide our formal commentary and 2017 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by collaborative relationships with our customers which give us valuable insight into their multi-year infrastructure capital programs. We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium term and believe large pipeline project market remains robust, with a multiyear cycle ahead of us. 
As I hope you have taken away from my comments this morning, we are confident that we will finish the year strong and we are optimistic about the potential we see for 2017 and beyond.
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and we'll continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our third quarter results. Derrick?"
33509,407604907,1074445,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 m",1994,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.94 billion in the prior year third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $73.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $43.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.55 for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.30 for the third quarter of 2015.
We did have a few items impacting our results for the quarter. First, as Duke mentioned, we made the $2.3 million contribution to an endowment with Sam Houston State University. Also, we had a slight true-up for costs associated with the power plant project in Alaska that impacted the electric power segment by around $3 million. Lastly, our tax rate is quite a bit higher, partly due to a lower proportion of income before taxes from international jurisdictions which are generally taxed at lower statutory rates, largely driven by delays in our Latin American concession work pushing more of the low-tax income into 2017. Also, as part of filing our 2015 Federal tax return, we had changes in estimates related to amounts qualifying for the domestic manufacturing tax deduction. Against our original estimates, these items added up to approximately $0.05 to $0.06 for the quarter.
Turning to our broader results. The increase in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with an increase in the number and size of oil and gas projects that moved into full construction during 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for gas distribution services. Also contributing to these increases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.
Our consolidated gross margin was 14.8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.1% in the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily associated with improved margins in our electric power segment, which I will discuss later in my prepared remarks.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, $164.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $18.6 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase was the result of $11.2 million in higher compensation expenses largely due to greater incentive compensation costs compared to the prior quarter. We accrue incentive compensation proportionate to the levels of income for the year, therefore, the third quarter of 2016 has a much higher level of accrual based on the higher operating income, as well as the proportion of income the quarter represents to 2016. 
In addition, we had $3.1 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives, the $2.3 million contribution to the endowment and $1 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies net of reduced acquisition costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2015. 
To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.22 billion, reflecting an increase of $39.3 million when compared to last year's third quarter or approximately 3.3%. This increase was primarily due to approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies. Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 9.7% in the third quarter 2016 as compared to 6.5% in last year's third quarter. Our margins for the quarter took a slight hit for the power plant but otherwise reflected solid productivity across most of our electric operations.
Last year's third quarter was impacted by significant delays in larger transmission projects, which at the time, led to an increasingly competitive smaller transmission market because of excess transmission construction resources in the industry. We were also impacted during that timeframe, as we transitioned resources from larger projects to smaller projects. Although we continued to bear the cost of certain underutilized large transmission resources and pressure from a more competitive environment for transmission projects, specifically in some regions of Canada, we have adjusted certain of our costs for the anticipated market environment and are better managing transitions between our smaller transmission projects. 
On the Alaska power plant project, we are continuing the documentation process and related activities to support our claims and recovery efforts to recoup from various parties a portion of the losses previously recognized on the project. While we do not know how successful these efforts will be or the timing of any recovery, we have not recognized any loss recovery on the project to date or forecasted any current recovery. We do not expect to further update on this project or potential recoveries unless matters change materially.
As of September 30, 2016, 12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment increased 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively, when compared to June 30, 2016, due to new contract awards partially offset by normal contract burn. 
Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $63.5 million or 8.4% to $819.8 million in the third quarter of '16. This increase is primarily from an increase in the number of size of projects that moved into full construction in 3Q '16, as well as increased customer spending for distribution services. Also contributing to the increase was approximately $5 million of revenues from acquired companies. 
Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 8% in 3Q '16 from 7.8% in 3Q '15 and increased significantly from 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 due to higher revenues associate with large-diameter pipeline projects which typically carry higher margins.
12-month backlog for the oil and gas segment decreased by $35.3 million or 1.4%, and total backlog decreased $85.2 million or 2.5% when compared to June 30, 2016. These decreases were due to the timing of awards, as well as expected contract burn during the quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts. 
Corporate and non-allocated costs were comparable quarter-over-quarter.
For the third quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations used approximately $69.3 million and net capital expenditures were $29 million, resulting in $98.4 million of negative free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of $69.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the increased working capital requirement associated with the significant increase in the number and size of oil and gas infrastructure projects that moved into full construction in 3Q '16.
In addition, last quarter, I made mention of some unbilled production that was moving slower than expected through the approval process with a customer that resulted in our current working capital balance being a bit higher. Although previous discussions with the customer's senior management had proven promising on the amount of billing and collections we would achieve this quarter, the approval process has remained demanding, and in our opinion, at times, beyond reason. Progress on the project overall has created a level of adjustments to the contract value, largely associated with unit adders, as defined in the contract, which have also contributed to a higher unbilled balance.
We have added personnel to manage the meticulous requirements that had been presented, and subsequent to the quarter, have continued to receive positive comments from the customer for resolution. However, during the third quarter, these payment delays negatively affected our free cash flow. As of September, the accounts receivable and unbilled balances with this customer represented 11 days of our overall DSO position of 79 days, which compares to DSO of 85 days at September 30 of last year. DSOs are otherwise lower compared to last September due to more favorable upfront billing positions on other contracts.
Cash flows from operations for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, provided approximately $196.9 million and net capital expenditures were $127.3 million, resulting in approximately $69.6 million of year-to-date free cash flow.
At quarter end, we had $117.4 million in cash. The end of the quarter, we also had $313.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding, and we had $479.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.13 billion in total liquidity as of September 30, 2016.
Turning to guidance. For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We have lowered our revenue expectations due to delays on several projects, which has shifted revenue from 2016 to early 2017, primarily due to permitting delays as well as some delay due to the rainfall associated with Hurricane Matthew. 
This slight reduction in revenue expectations has a corresponding impact on our earnings projection for the year. And after considering the items I previously mentioned that impacted the third quarter, we now anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.17 and $1.22. We also anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.51 and $1.56. 
Despite some of the project timing impacts, we continue to believe the fourth quarter will be our highest-revenue quarter of the year, at or near record levels for the company. Our current expectations are for electric power revenues to be comparable to last year's fourth quarter, with consolidated revenue growth quarter-over-quarter being driven by the oil and gas segment. 
Although we expect to perform higher levels of storm work in the fourth quarter of 2016, we still expect margins for the electric power segment to be in the low 8% range for the year. A significant number of the crews deployed to emergency restoration services associated with Hurricane Matthew left existing customer work, and therefore, the net increase will be tempered. It is too soon to quantify the net effect of storm work as of today. Also, normal seasonality is expected to negatively impact fourth quarter margins for the segment.
Margins in the oil and gas segment are expected to be near 5.5% for the year. The storm work benefiting the electric power segment in October had a negative impact on the oil and gas segment, delaying start times on certain projects by a couple of weeks, which contributed to our overall lower revenue expectations. Our margin expectations are still intact for these individual projects, but the lower contributions to the quarter will somewhat offset the overall contributions of storm work to the consolidated quarter. 
We estimate that interest expense will approach $15 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for the year to be around 41.5%. 
Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. 
For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 2016, we are assuming 157.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $205 million to $215 million, and this compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.
We are committed to attending our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which positions the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. We will continue to focus on the strong cash flow of our base business and concentrate on mitigating the more pronounced fluctuations in cash flow associated with the working capital requirements of larger projects. 
Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures and organic growth, with an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions and other strategic investments.
This concludes our formal presentation, and we will now open the line for Q&A.

But the underpinning -- the underlying base business, as we'll continue to talk about, is good. There's demand there. We continue to grow that business. We're excited about it. As we stated, where headcount's higher, we'll continue to invest in our workforce. So we like -- we see the capital spends of our customers, we're talking to them daily, so we're able to understand where they're going. And we -- you can look at what they say on their earnings calls, and we believe the capital spends will increase over the next few years, especially that we could see. So the underlying business will continue to grow, with some of the larger projects will come in on top of that. 
And Canada, just a little bit on that. It's more dependent on your energy -- on your oil and where your oil pricing is. So it's really difficult for us to try to pin that down on where the larger projects are going. We have continued to get our cost structure in line with what the market is. We do have some nice projects in backlog that we believe will move forward in '17. So we're in pretty good shape for the foreseeable future in Canada."

You've seen here in the third quarter that if you exclude the power plant, that we're posting a number that's effectively double-digit margins in electric power segment. We talked about our ability to beat it back there. That is partly because of the cost control efforts in Canada, but it's also because of the strong margins in the U.S. The U.S. market, as it stands here today for 2016, we are executing at the double-digit margin profile. The pressure for the year is partly coming from MLP, obviously, but as well as some of the pressure associated with the Canadian market. But that's where our cost control efforts have predominantly been. And as we look forward, we can see the opportunity to be working on a couple of those larger projects in '17. So a combination of the cost control and those larger projects, we think, bode well for Canadian margins, at least to lessen the dilution that's currently being created by Canada. But the U.S. market is still operating well, and we think we're very much focused on returning the Canadian margins to a greater benefit."

And then just to follow up on that, you talked about within oil and gas, the one project being deferred is getting pushed into 2017. Can you quantify that? So that's my nitpicky question. 
And my real question is, Derrick or Duke, whoever wants to answer this, are there -- I understand you don't want to give specific margin guidance for 2017, but are there any headwinds that we don't -- we can make our own assumptions on the market. Are there any headwinds that you know of today that would depress margins in '17? Because, I mean, I'm just thinking we have Alaska, that's gone. We have Canada, which should be less of a headwind, you've restructured. I'm just -- I just don't understand why margins shouldn't be materially higher when we're thinking about '17 versus '16. You had the endowment, you're investing in technology. There just seems to be a whole bunch of negatives that go away in '16 that would imply a much higher EPS number for '17."

The international revenues right now run about 15% of our consolidated revenues. That includes some Latin America and some Australia work. But from Canada, that gives you -- let's say that it's probably running in the 10% to 15% range. So you can kind of do some backwards math looking at the relative dilution. 
Oil and gas pushed to '17, quantification, I would tell you that the largest portion of our revenue adjustment for the year is associated with those individual oil and gas projects. 
And then for margin guidance for '17, I can color first and just simply say that I think your assessment's not unfair. Mainly even if we just look at the elimination of MLP year-over-year, we don't know that we're going to see any sizable moves from a cost structure perspective, from a G&A perspective, so the rest of it is going to come down largely to execution and the timing of the project.

So you've had some stuff that's pushed into the first half, sounds as if you're going to have a pretty big first half. Atlantic Coast isn't supposed to start until later in the year. So it sounds like there's the potential for a little bit of a sort of abnormal flow to the year with kind of an air pocket in the third quarter which would normally be the high-water mark for the year.

Is there any reason -- kind of going back to what Jamie was asking earlier, is there any reason why you can't get into the 10% to 11% range in electrical next year? And then with oil and gas, the large-diameter stuff is the best-margin work that you do. And I understand that there's probably drags from really low profit levels on more of the gathering work you're doing. But just sort of maybe, Derrick, if you can help us think through the moving pieces of all these segments.

And so when you ki",413,"Yes, so as it relates to this quarter. And again, you exclude power plant, you saw margins that were in the 10% range. But it's important to remember that, that's also our highest-margin quarter typically from a seasonality perspective. And so when you kind of model out how we think the fourth quarter is going to play out, I think you're going to model out, that you're going to see margins dropping below 10% in the electric power segment because of that seasonality. We think that seasonality will definitely be impacting the quarters of 2017. For the last few years, you've seen a lot less of that seasonal dynamic because of the contributions of Canada. But as we stand here today, you see lesser contributions of Canada, both from a volume perspective as well as because of the fact that the overall performance of Canada is contributing at a lower margin level. 
So although it's too soon to comment as to exactly how guidance will play out, I think those are important factors to think about when you think about our ability to maintain double-digit margins in every quarter of '17. I think seasonal impacts will exist, and so that will be putting some level of pressure on our ability to be at that double digit throughout the year. 
Relative to oil and gas, it's a big factor as to when the individual projects start and stop in the individual quarters. Thinking about the second quarter commentary that we provided on the fourth quarter of this year, we talked about the potential for the ability of margins to see an uptick. As we stand here today, we're not seeing that because of the timing of those projects, some of those projects pushing out of the fourth quarter. So any of those individual starts or stops of projects can very much influence the mix of the work in the quarters, and therefore, for the year. And that's the biggest portion of what drives our -- the level of margins being up in that double-digit range for oil and gas at this stage. Higher levels at given times in given quarters for those large-diameter pipe can definitely give us the ability to be in there. But as Duke's commentary talked about, it's too soon to yet comment as to how the back half of the year will play out, to be able to really feel out the ability to be at double-digit margins right now."
