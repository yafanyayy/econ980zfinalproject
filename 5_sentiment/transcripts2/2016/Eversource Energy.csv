I have the easy job this morning of making the introductions. And let me start by saying, surprise, surprise! We had another great year.

And let me start by saying, surprise, surprise! We had another great year. Jim in a minute will take you through all the numbers to explain that and Lee will take you through the significant big capital projects that we have, and they will both report on great progress so we won quite nicely. 
One of the things that we have been focusing on for the past 4 years is customer service. Those of you that know me, I'm not about customer service. And I think that in 2016, operationally, we have the best ever year, with record reliability, record number of customers we were able to connect into our gas system, and we think we did that at a time when the delivery part of our bills have been very, very stable. 
In 2016, we think we're going to bring it to the next level. We're focused on the customer touch points. We have successfully implemented a new outage management system throughout the 3 states so that, if you will, our order entry system is consistent for all 3.5 million of our customers. And with this technology, which has great connectivity between our customers and our electrical components, we're going to be able to take it the next level with a communication strategy that will let the customers know exactly what's going on at all times with their system and their connections. We are also going to be rolling out a new bill, a new website. Again, important interactions with the customer that we think are the key to our success long-term. 
For the region, as you know, it's an exciting time in New England. We are in a very unique phase. I think just last week, Gordon Van Weeley, who runs [indiscernible] New England made a great presentation to the business community. And its focus was the needs going forward, and critical first thing that he addressed is the gas infrastructure needs, show the difference between our pricing and New England -- excuse me, and New York and other regions in the winter time frames when our gas infrastructure experiences constraints. And whether gas prices are high or whether gas prices are low, the differential this very significant. He also talked about the transmission system and the impacts that are going to be felt as we as a region meet our carbon reduction goals and move almost 35 [ph] or more than 35% of our fossil generation over the renewable generation. And so exciting time and we're right in the middle of that and we'll talk more about that. 
And for investors, of course, you know that we work for you. The foundation for TSR, which we measure very carefully, is growing earnings per share and growing dividends. And that's what we'll talk to about, our ability to continue that as we go forward. And as we do that, we think we will provide attractive returns while maintaining the highest credit rating in the industry. 
If you flip to Page 4, my favorite slide in the deck. We continue to outperform our peers in the market over the long-term. Last year was kind of a flat year. We do believe we did better than the industry. And as you can see by the bottom chart, as long as we keep our dividends growing, and this week we raised our dividend 6.6% or $0.11. And despite that, we still, as you know, have a very modest payout ratio.
I won't dwell on those numbers, although, I do like to. The last slide which I just mentioned before I turn it over to Lee is Page 5. And we're really quite proud of this. We've grown into a role as a regional leader. I meant, I referenced the ISO New England in the presentation that Gordon made and their view on the regional challenges. But what has been very interesting, and Lee's in the center of all this, is as the largest layer of New England, we seem to be that everyone comes to when they think they can help our customers in the region and achieve our energy goals. And so we're working with several partners to help create the solutions that will bring us to the modern era, whether that's the pipeline constraints that I mentioned. Again, we think we have the best project and the best partner in the form of Spectra Energy that allows us to use existing facilities that pass by every one of our most efficient, new, gas-fired units in New England. And with our plan, we'll keep those units in the competitive queue each and every day of the winter. On the renewable energy side, we think we have -- and there, we'll probably talk a little bit more about the 3 state RFP, but as we look at that, we think we have really the only dispatchable project that can flow a substantial amount, no pun intended, of carbon-free energy into the region at the peak times that will, again, affect the pricing in the Q. Whether it's the oil heat dependency that in particular in Connecticut is a key program in the Connecticut Energy Policy, we found this year that despite the fact that the gap between oil and gas shrunk considerably, that people still want to convert and we were able to convert above [ph] 11,000 customers last year. And I think we already converted 1,000 in January. So the mild weather, while we don't like it from a sales perspective, allows us to continue and get a lot of work done. And of course, the forefront of everything in New England in terms of solving our energy problems and backing out carbon is energy efficiency. It's the cheapest way to achieve our objective. We have award-winning EE programs. As the slide says, we spend $0.5 billion at year. But last year, we actually exceeded our goals -- spent less, exceeded our megawatt hour goals and had our incentives. We exceeded our plan by about $5 million on the incentive side. So we -- we're very proud of that. The bottom line is, we want our customers to see us as the solution to their energy concerns, and that's why it's an exciting place to be, New England, and for us to be in the center of all this. 
And with that, I know you would like to hear more about the projects every time I'm in front of a group. They want to ask about Northern Pass or Access Northeast, and my board is always interested in what's going on with the project. So with that, I'll hand it over to Lee to give you more flavor and the progress report on where we are on some of this stuff."

I'll provide you a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then I'll turn the call over to Jim. Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 7. In December, the New Hampshire Sight Evaluation Committee or SEC determined that our",1476,"Thank you, Tom. I'll provide you a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then I'll turn the call over to Jim. 
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 7. In December, the New Hampshire Sight Evaluation Committee or SEC determined that our Northern Pass application is complete and commenced a formal review process. As part of that process the SEC held 5 public information sessions on the project in January and will hold another round of public hearings later this quarter. Simultaneously, we continue to respond to questions about the project from the multiple state agencies that are participating in the review.
As you can see from Slide 8, we expect the New Hampshire SEC to vote on the Northern Pass consistent with its current schedule, which concludes on December 19.
In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy will host a series of 4 public hearings on Environmental Impact Statement, or EIS, on Northern Pass the week of March 7. Two of them will be held jointly with the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee. 
Written comments on the draft EIS are due to the DOE by April 4. We expect the DOE to finalize the EIS in the second half of this year and anticipate a presidential permit issued soon after the New Hampshire SEC process has concluded. That timetable has not changed and will ensure that all relevant conditions of the SEC decision will be reflected in the presidential permit as well. 
We continue to feel very good about the review process in Northern Pass. We're receiving strong support for the project, both inside and outside of New Hampshire. But the first public information session last month in Franklin, New Hampshire, with the DC to AC converter station will be located, we received significant support from local leaders, the business community and labor representatives. 
In Massachusetts, Governor Baker said in his State of the State speech last month, that increasing access to affordable hydroelectric power was the top priority of his administration. As Jim will discuss in a few moments, our new capital expenditure forecast reflects the revised $1.6 billion of cost of the project we announced in October and also allows the vast majority of the construction to take place in 2017 and 2018.
As you probably know, Northern Pass is 1 of 2 projects connected to Eversource that were built into the joint state RFP. As shown on Slide 9, the other project is the Clean Energy Connect. This project involves construction of the new, 600 megawatt, 25-mile transmission line between a transmission substation we owned in Hillsdale, Massachusetts and a transmission substation in Eastern New York State.
This project will utilize a back-to-back HVDC converters to ensure deliverability into New England.
We are developing it with Brookfield and [indiscernible] in EDP renewables. This partner already has a presence in the arc, have not been specific about the cost. But our share, which is entirely a transmission investment, will be more than $400 million.
If approved as part of the RFP we expect this project to be built in the 2018 through 2020 time frame and for our investment to earn returns consistent with regulated transmission investments. Each of the 3 states involved in the Clean Energy RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, will go through a process to select the winning bids and submit them to regulators for approval. The RFP schedule is on Slide 10.
As you can see, we expect contracts with the successful bidders to be executed by the end of the third quarter and for the contracts to be approved by the end of this year. We believe that the 2 projects we are jointly proposing represent the region's best options for low-cost, firm, reliable and noncarbon emitting resources.
Regarding Northern Pass, our bids into the RFP does not change in any respect to significant benefits this project will provide to the host state of New Hampshire. Our Forward New Hampshire plan remains in place. We anticipate $80 million per year in energy savings to New Hampshire, additional savings specific to New Hampshire as a result of a power purchase agreement with HQ, a commitment to higher New Hampshire Workers First, a $200 million fund to support economic development and community initiatives as well as other benefits.
I'll now turn to Slide 11. On the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing [indiscernible] pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in the Massachusetts to bring firm gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of the Access Northeast project is 40% or $1.2 [ph] billion. FERC has accepted the prefiling in May last year and we are continuing to submit information on the project to FERC as part of that process.
In January, staff completed 13 -- FERC staff completed 13 open houses on the project in the region. We plan to make our formal application filing late this year to meet our initial in-service date of 2018. The project is designed to add 900 million cubic feet of -- per day of natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow of up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient and low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as 2013, 2014. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will go as new proposed plants are built. 
The project allows direct, last mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business models the electric utility signs pipeline capacity contracts up to 20 years with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently unable to run the units during cold weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. 
The large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the needs of natural gas generators. We can depend less on more costly and higher emitting coal and oil plants that typically run when the region's natural gas supplies run short.
We made significant progress in the past 3 months, a status of securing approval of contracts with New England Electric Distribution companies is on Slide 12. Following an RFP this past fall that attracted a number of bids, Instar Electric and Western Mass Electric filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in December seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. The 2 utilities asked for a decision via October 1 of this year. National Grid's 2 Massachusetts electric distribution companies, Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric, made a similar filing with the DPU on January 15. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for nearly 45% of the Access Northeast targeted capacity. 
In Connecticut, the natural gas capacity RFP will be run by the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection or DEEP. We expect this process to be complete later this year.
In New Hampshire, the Public Utilities Commission issued an order in January 19 in which they expected a staff report that concluded that the PUC had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts are shown to be in the customers' interest. If the PUC Commissions agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted would be in the customers best interest. 
In Maine, where regulators have engaged on the natural gas contracting issue for some time, bidders were given an opportunity to refresh their proposals in December. State regulators are scheduled to make their decision on recommended solutions by midyear. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in November. At the same time, the Massachusetts Electric Distribution Company issued their RFP. We expect the National Grid to make a decision and file in the coming months with Rhode Island. 
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation has yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be concluded this fall so that we can file our formal application with FERC before the end of 2016. We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near term and long-term answer to the regions' intensifying winter supply challenges. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 14, I'll start by covering our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the year. Our 2016 outlook and long-term EPS growth expectations through 2019 account regulatory developments in the absence of rate case activity for the next 12 to 18 months. And I'll conclude with a brief overview of how we've delivered on the commitments that we made to investors in recent years.
Let's start with the fourth quarter. As you can see from Slide 15, earnings, excluding integration costs, was $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter, compared with earnings of $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.60 per share is consistent with the guidance that we gave on the third quarter earnings call and consistent with the updated Street estimates that have been published this year.
Electric Distribution and Generation in earnings declined by $0.07 per share to $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter 2015. Higher retail electric revenue, mostly due to the December 2014 Connecticut light and power distribution rate decision added about $0.05 per share to earnings. But that impact was offset by higher property taxes and depreciation expense due to higher plant balances and higher amortization expense due to the amortization of CLMP's deferred storm balance.
Earnings for NSTAR Electric and public service in New Hampshire, which do not have revenue decoupling, were lower due to milder weather. Earnings in this segment were also lower due to a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. 
On a consolidated basis, our effective rate, tax rate, was approximately 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 35.4% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The higher rate lowered consolidated earnings in the quarter by about $0.04 per share. 
As expected, transmission earnings were down $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the absence of the fourth quarter 2014 reversal of a reserve related to FERC's review of the New England transmission ROEs.
The historically mild temperatures this past December were the primary reason for our $13.2 million or $0.04 per share decline in our natural gas segment earnings. Lower natural gas revenues alone cost us $0.03 per share, despite having 2% more heating customers in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Average temperatures in Boston were 10 to 12 degrees warmer than average in December. As a result, our firm natural gas sales were down 16% [ph] in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a fairly mild fourth quarter of 2014. 
Talent and Other improved by $0.02 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. 
I'll now turn to full year results. Excluding integration charges, we earned $2.81 per share this year compared with $2.65 in 2014. 2015 results were consistent with our guidance of $2.80 to $2.85 per share, and also consistent with recently updated Street estimates. 
As you can see in the news release, the most significant driver of earnings growth in 2015 was higher electric revenue, which added $0.39 per share to our results compared with last year. The primary driver was approximately $150 million distribution rate increase for Connecticut Light & Power. We also benefited from a 0.3% increase in retail electric sales. Those higher revenues were offset in part by higher property taxes, depreciation and the CLMP storm amortization expense in 2015.
Higher electric transmission earnings also contributed to improved year-end results. Our transmission segment earned $0.96 per share in 2015 compared with $0.93 in 2014, benefiting in part from a higher level of investment in the business. As a result of our robust capital program, our transmission rate base was approximately $5.2 [ph] billion at the end of 2015 compared with $4.9 [ph] billion at the end of 2014. Those benefits were partially offset by FERC decision last year the lower the base transmission ROE in New England to 10.57% from the previous 11.14% [ph] and to cap our ROEs on any liability project regardless of previously approved incentives at 11.74%. As we've said in the past, those changes have reduced our effective transmission ROE including incentives to approximately 11.5%. 
Turning to our natural gas distribution business. After a very strong start, our year-end 2015 results were almost identical to those that we recorded in 2014. For the year, due to the warm fourth quarter, firm natural gas sales were down 1% after being up 8.4% in the first quarter of 2015.
On a weather normalized basis, sales rose 2.5% for the year. Talent and Other results were down $0.01 for the year. 
Two other items worth mentioning in 2015 were the benefits of lower O&M and the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. Lower and nontracked O&M added $0.08 per share to earnings in 2015. This follows a $0.23 per share benefit in 2014 and a $0.05 per share benefit in 2013 [ph]. Altogether, we have reduced our own O&M by about $250 million since the merger closed in 2012.
Offsetting much of that benefit was the higher effective tax rate in 2015, which lowered earnings by about $0.06 per share as compared with the previous year. So in spite of the warm fourth quarter, we were still able to grow earnings for the year by $0.16, or 6% in 2015. 
Turning to the financial slide for operations. As you can see on Slide 16, our key reliability have dramatically improved and are record levels as Tom mentioned.
Since 2011, the number of months between interruptions and the speed of restoration when outages do occur have both improved by about 40%. We are well up in the top quartile of our peers so we're very proud of this accomplishment.
This closes our 2015 discussion. Let's move on to 2016. On Slide 17, you can see we've established an earnings per share range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. The biggest year-over-year benefit will come from the growth of our transmission rate base. The second biggest positive driver will be the natural gas segment. We expect that segment to benefit from a continued increase in natural gas heating customers, various capital initiatives for which we have trackers and a $15.8 million base rate increase that was effective at NSTAR Gas on January 1 of this year.
Other drivers include lower O&M. In the first quarter of this year, we will migrate our legacy payroll and benefit system to a single IT platform, which we've already done with our accounting and outage management systems. Consolidating into a single system is expected to significantly improve efficiency and lower cost in the future. 
Offsetting these benefits are continued increases in depreciation, property taxes and modestly higher interest cost, reflecting continued investment in our distribution systems. 
From 2016, let's turn to the longer-term in Slide 18. We estimate that we grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually over the 2015 to '19 forecast period. This compares with our previous growth rate of 6% to 8% for the 2014 to 2018 period. Nearly all of that change is attributable to the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation for tax purposes recently passed by Congress. 
We estimate that bonus depreciation alone is lowering our growth rate by approximately 1%. 
Components of the 5% to 7% growth are similar to what has driven the 7.2% annual earnings growth since our 2012 merger. We've also noted our key assumptions about major projects, which include the completion of Northern Pass in 2019 and the construction of Access Northeast in 2018 and '19. Because significant Access Northeast construction is expected to continue beyond our forecast period, we anticipate that it will contribute to earnings growth in both 2020 and 2021 as well.
Electric transmission capital expenditures and rate base growth are the primary drivers of our attractive earnings growth projection. 
Turning to Slide 19. You can see that capital expenditure projections are up significantly from the forecast we showed you a year ago. To begin, I should note that our transmission capital expenditures totaled $807 million in 2015. That's about $67 million above our projection at this time last year. We now show nearly $5 billion of electric transmission investment from 2015 through 2019. As we do every year, we have again identified transmission investments that we didn't have in the plan 1 year ago. We've added about $800 million of new investment. $200 million of that increase involves our previously announced increase in the Northern Pass project. We are projecting transmission capital expenditures of $911 million in 2016, $880 million of which will be spent on reliability related, transmission projects at our 4 regulated electric companies.
Two of the largest initiatives, the Greater Boston and Greater Hartford projects, involved dozens of individual projects and are described more fully in the transmission slides in our appendix. Those expenditures are helping to drive significant improvements in reliability and transmission earnings growth in 2016. 
You can see that we expect little capital spending on Northern Pass in 2016, but considerable expenditures in 2017 and '18, consistent with the schedule that we gave you earlier. These capital expenditure projections do not reflect our spending on the Clean Energy Connect project we discussed earlier, which we expect will contribute to earnings growth from 2018 to 2021.
We continue to work on both Clean Energy Connect and other potential projects that we expect to be approved. As a result, the arrow on the slides shows that we do not expect a significant decline in transmission spending in 2019, but we have not included all of the potential projects that are likely to be built that year. Because we are in a competitive bidding process, we are not providing a total cost of the Clean Energy Connect project or year-by-year estimates of capital expenditures. We hope to provide that to you should the project be selected.
Let's turn to Slide 20. On the left-hand side, the slide shows our capital program excluding both Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect. From 2016 through 2019, we expect to invest $9.2 billion in New England's energy infrastructure, including $3.9 [ph] billion in transmission that I mentioned earlier. You can see that electric and natural gas distribution capital total about $1.2 billion every year during that period. A slide in the appendix shows that investments in our natural gas delivery system will comprise a rising percentage of that investment. On the right-hand side, we have estimated the pace of our $1.2 billion projected investment in the Access Northeast project, which cost a total of $3 billion.
Our FERC application indicates that elements of Access Northeast will be phased into service between late 2018 and 2021. 
On Slide 21, we illustrate how the composition of our rate base is expected to change by the end of 2019. About $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion of rate base growth over the next 4 years is expected to come from electric transmission. By the end of 2019, we expect that electric transmission will comprise 42% of our total rate base. And if our Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect investments were included, it puts us at nearly 50% FERC-regulated company by the end of 2019. We believe that this rising percentage of FERC investments will result in an increasing ROE to Eversource Energy as a whole. 
Slide 22 shows various initiatives that we expect to continue beyond our current full year forecast. As I said, earlier, we expect significant expenditures on Access Northeast, Clean Energy Connect and other projects we are working on, while also expecting continued work on modernizing the electric grid in Massachusetts, assuming our $430 million 5-year plan and capital tracker are approved by the state regulators we expect later this year.
Our other initiatives are primarily tied to growing our natural gas distribution business. 
Turning to Slide 23, you can see that despite declining oil prices, we added 11,415 new natural gas customers in 2015. This is about 7.5% ahead of 2014 and 4% ahead of our target for the year.
This slide shows that we expect new heating customer growth to continue to accelerate over our forecast period and eventually reach about 16,000 per year, significantly aided by legislatively endorsed initiatives in both Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 2016, we're projecting approximately 12,500 new natural gas heating customers and Tom mentioned that one month into the year, we're on plan.
Schedule 24 -- Slide 24 reviews 2 important regulatory items that are currently pending. Hearings on the divestiture of our New Hampshire generation fleet were completed this week and we expect the decision within the next 2 months. Last week, a settlement was filed with certain advisory staff at the New Hampshire PUC who had earlier supported a delay to the sale. They now support near-term divestiture. Should the New Hampshire PUC authorize the divestiture, we expect the sale process and securitization to be completed later this year and early next year. As a reminder, we expect full recovery of approximately $700 million invested in New Hampshire generation by early 2017. 
In December, the FERC administrative wire judge handling second and third New England ROE complaints requested some additional briefing on an aspect of the second complaint. So, an initial recommendation by that ALJ was delayed from December 2015 to the end of March 2016. Because of that 3-month delay by the ALJ, we now expect to receive a decision from FERC on the 2 complaints in either late 2016 or early 2017. 
As you can see on Slide 25, we have no general rate cases currently pending for any of our 6 regulated distribution utilities. And while we do expect rate case activity next year, we expect that any decisions would not impact our financial results until the end of 2017 or early 2018. So we have very good visibility into our distribution company results for the next 2 years. 
Turning to this year's financing calendar, 2016 is likely to be similar to last year. One benefit of bonus depreciation of course, is that it lowers our cash tax obligation. In 2016, we will receive an estimated $250 million to $300 million in refunds from taxes paid in 2015.
Additionally, we expect our cash tax liability for 2016 to be lowered by approximately $300 million as well. In 2017, bonus depreciation is estimated to lower our cash tax obligation by another $300 million.
Slide 26 shows the current distribution of S&P's electric utility credit ratings with Eversource as the only A rated parent company as a result of our upgrade last year. We've also noted on the slide several positive outlooks on other subsidiaries at both Fitch and Moody's. 
Slide 27 shows the relative price performance of Eversource's shares versus the S&P 500 and the UTY since our merger was announced more than 4 years ago. We're very proud of our total shareholder return as well as our strong credit ratings. We strongly believe that financial strength and attractive shareholder returns can certainly both coexist and do at Eversource.
Slide 28 sums up what we've delivered to customers, policymakers and investors over the past 4 years. We committed that we'd exceed industry earnings per share and dividend growth rates and we delivered with growth rates that are 2x the industry average for 3 years. we targeted O&M reductions of 3% to 4% and achieved 5% per year for 3 years on average. We said we'd maintain the strong financial condition. We've done better than maintain 3 upgrades since the merger announcement has us with the only A credit in the industry. 
We committed to top-tier service and reliability, a 40% improvement in reliability has us now consistently in the top quartile of our peers. We committed to grow and leverage our transmission in gas business. This morning we've discussed the great portfolio projects that will continue that great growth. 
And finally, advancing energy policy in the region are Access Northeast project Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect are game changers, cost effectively advancing the region's carbon reduction agenda effectively.
Eversource continues to be a very attractive offering for investors and we're confident that we'll continue to be in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff."

But I'm just wondering, you said that the vast majority of the reduction in the growth rate is due to bonus, and yet you've also significantly increased your capital expenditure budget.

And I've seen a number of estimates out there where companies have -- analysts have estimated that it's about a 1% increase on a company -- an increase on a company like Eversource. I would tell you this that as you well know that we have a long track record, Tom and I, 20 years of delivering on guidance, either meeting or exceeding it. And the other thing that I've mentioned is we tend to provide data to the street, forecasted data, capital expenditure data that ties out to the dollar to projects we have in the Q. So we have obviously updated the forecast for the projects that we have and the impact has been at a 5% to 7% growth rate is a better guidance for Wall Street and incredible guidance in the 6% to 8% that we had previously. That being said, I'll tell you that a year ago, we didn't provide capital expenditure numbers for Access Northeast, and look how long that project -- how far along that project has come. 3 months ago at our third quarter call, we didn't provide any guidance. clean Energy Connect wasn't even mentioned as a project and we now have that before the regulator to be approved. So we tend to find projects going forward. We don't put them into our plan until they're real. So I think we have a very credible 5% to 7% with some upside going forward."

So we would expect and hope that FERC would realize that there hasn't been a dramatic change in what they approved over a year ago in terms of the base ROE. The same logic applies on the cap as well. The 11.74% sits well within what the math would show from applying the new methodology at FERC to the time frames that were considered for complaint 2 or 3. Obviously, there's a series of conflicting testimony, I guess, from the consumer advocate groups and from FERC staff that would have slightly lower numbers.

And let me start by saying, surprise, surprise, we've had another great year. Jim, in a minute, will take you through all the numbers to explain that, and Lee will take you through the significant big capital projects that we have, and they will both report on great progress. So we're moving along quite nicely. 
One of the things that we have been focusing on for the past 4 years is customer service. Those of you that know me, I'm a nut about customer service. And I think that in 2016, operationally, we have the best ever year with record reliability, record number of customers we were able to connect into our gas system. And we think we did that at a time when the delivery part of our bills have been very, very stable.
In 2016, we think we're going to bring it to the next level. We're focused on the customer touch points. We have successfully implemented a new outage management system throughout the 3 states so that, if you will, our order entry system is consistent at -- for all 3.5 million of our customers. And with this technology, which has great connectivity between our customers and our electrical components, we're going to be able to take it to the next level with a communication strategy that will let the customers know exactly what's going on at all times with their system and their connections. We're also going to be rolling out a new bill, new website -- again, important interactions with the customer that we think are the key to our success long term. 
For the region, as you know, it's an exciting time in New England. We are in a very unique phase. I think just last week, Gordon van Welie, who runs ISO New England, made a great presentation to the business community. And its focus was the needs going forward. And a critical first thing that he addressed is the gas infrastructure needs, showed the difference between our pricing and New England -- excuse me, and New York and other regions in the winter time frames when our gas infrastructure experiences constraints. And whether gas prices are high or gas prices are low, the differential is very significant. He also talked about the transmission system and the impacts that are going to be felt as we, as a region, meet our carbon reduction goals and move almost 35% or more than 35% of our fossil generation over the renewable generation. And so an exciting time, and we're right in the middle of that, and we'll talk more about that. 
And for investors, of course, you know that we work for you. The foundation for TSR, which we measure very carefully, is growing earnings per share and growing dividends. And that's what we'll talk to you about, our ability to continue that as we go forward. And as we do that, we think we will provide attractive returns while maintaining the highest credit rating in the industry.
If you flip to Page 4, my favorite slide in the deck. We continue to outperform our peers in the market over the long term. Last year was kind of a flat year. We do believe we did better than the industry. And as you can see by the bottom chart, as long as we keep our dividends growing -- and this week we raised our dividend 6.6% or $0.11. And despite that, we still, as you know, have a very modest payout ratio.
I won't dwell on those numbers, although I do like to. The last slide I just would mention before I turn it over to Lee is Page 5. And we're really quite proud of this. We've grown into a role as a regional leader. I meant -- I referenced the recent ISO New England presentation that Gordon made and their view on the regional challenges. But what has been very interesting, and Lee is in the center of all this, is that as the largest player in New England, we seem to be the one that everybody comes to when they think they can help our customers in the region achieve our energy goals. And so we're working with several partners to help create the solutions that will bring us to the modern era, whether that's the pipeline constraints that I mentioned. Again, we think we have the best project and the best partner in the form of Spectra Energy that allows us to use existing facilities that pass by every one of our most efficient, new gas-fired units in New England. And with our plan, we'll keep those units in the competitive Q each and every day of the winter. On the renewable energy side, we think we have -- and there, we'll probably talk a little bit more about the 3-state RFP. But as we look at that, we think we have really the only dispatchable project that can flow a substantial amount, no pun intended, of carbon-free energy into the region at the peak times that will again affect pricing in the Q. Whether it's the oil heat dependency that, in particular, in Connecticut is a key program in the Connecticut energy policy, we found this year that despite the fact that the gap between oil and gas shrunk considerably, that people still want to convert, and we were able to convert about 11,000 customers last year. And I think we already converted 1,000 in January. So the mild weather, while we don't like it from a sales perspective, allows us to continue and get a lot of work done. 
And of course, the forefront of everything in New England in terms of solving our energy problems and backing out carbon is energy efficiency. It's the cheapest way to achieve our objective. We have award-winning EE programs. As the slide says, we spend $0.5 billion a year. But last year, we actually exceeded our goals -- spent less, exceeded our megawatt-hour goals and had our incentives. We exceeded our plan by about $5 million on the incentive side. So we're very proud of that. The bottom line is we want our customers to see us as the solution to their energy concerns. And that's why it's an exciting place to be, New England, and for us to be in the center of all this. 
And with that, I know you would like to hear more about the projects. Every time I'm in front of a group, they want to ask about Northern Pass or Access Northeast, and even my board is always interested in what's going on with the project.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Lee to give you more flavor and a progress report on where we are with some of this stuff."

I'll provide you a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call over to Jim.
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 7. In December, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, determined that our Northern Pass application is complete and commenced the formal review process. As part of that process, the SEC held 5 public information sessions on the project in January and will hold another round of public hearings later this quarter. Simultaneously, we continue to respond to questions about the project from the multiple state agencies that are participating in the review. As you can see from Slide 8, we expect the New Hampshire SEC to vote on the Northern Pass consistent with its current schedule, which concludes on December 19.
In parallel, U.S. Department of Energy will host a series of 4 public hearings on its draft Environmental Impact Statement, or EIS, on Northern Pass the week of March 7. Two of them will be held jointly with the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee. 
Written comments on the draft EIS are due to the DOE by April 4. We expect the DOE to finalize the EIS in the second half of this year and anticipate a presidential permit issued soon after the New Hampshire SEC process has concluded. That time table has not changed, and we'll ensure that all relevant conditions of the SEC decision will be reflected in the presidential permit as well.
We continue to feel very good about the review process on Northern Pass. We're receiving strong support for the project, both inside and outside of New Hampshire. At the first public information session last month in Franklin, New Hampshire, where the DC-to-AC converter station will be located, we received significant support from local leaders, the business community and labor representatives.
In Massachusetts, Governor Baker said in his State of the State speech last month that increasing access to affordable hydroelectric power was the top priority of his administration. As Jim will discuss in a few moments, our new capital expenditure forecast reflects the revised $1.6 billion of cost of the project we announced in October and also allows the vast majority of the construction to take place in 2017 and 2018. As you probably know, Northern Pass is 1 of 2 projects connected to Eversource that were built into the -- bid into the joint state RFP. 
As shown on Slide 9, the other project is the Clean Energy Connect. This project involves construction of the new 600-megawatt, 25-mile transmission line between a transmission substation we own in Hinsdale, Massachusetts and a transmission substation in Easton in the arc [ph] state. This project will utilize a back-to-back HVDC converters to ensure deliverability into New England. We are developing it with Brookfield and Iberdrola and EDP Renewables. This project already have a presence in the arc [ph], but we have not been specific about the cost. But our share, which is entirely a transmission investment, will be more than $400 million.
If approved, as part of the RFP, we expect this project to be built in the 2018 through 2020 time frame and for our investment to earn returns consistent with FERC-regulated transmission investments. Each of the 3 states involved in the Clean Energy RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, will go through a process to select the winning bids and submit them to regulators for approval. The RFP schedule is on Slide 10.
As you can see, we expect contracts with the successful bidders to be executed by the end of the third quarter and for the contracts to be approved by the end of this year. We believe that the 2 projects we are jointly proposing represent the region's best options for low-cost, firm, reliable and noncarbon-emitting resources.
Regarding Northern Pass, our bids into the RFP does not change in any respect to significant benefits this project will provide to the host state of New Hampshire. Our Forward New Hampshire Plan remains in place. We anticipate $80 million per year in energy savings to New Hampshire; additional savings specific to New Hampshire as a result of a power purchase agreement with HQ; a commitment to hire New Hampshire workers first; a $200 million fund to support economic development and community initiatives; as well as other benefits.
I'll now turn to Slide 11. In the Access Northeast project, we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts to bring firm gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of the Access Northeast project is 40% or $1.2 billion. FERC has accepted the prefiling we made last year, and we are continuing to submit information on the project to FERC as part of that process.
In January, staff completed 13 -- FERC staff completed 13 open houses on the project in the region. We plan to make our formal application filing late this year to meet our initial in-service date of 2018. The project is designed to add 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient and low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter, and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as 2013, 2014. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will grow as new proposed plants are built. 
The project allows direct, last-mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business models at the electric utility signed pipeline capacity contracts for up to 20 years with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently unable to run the units during cold weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. The large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the needs of natural gas generators. We can depend less on more costly and higher emitting coal and oil plants that typically run when the region's natural gas supplies are on shut.
We have made significant progress in the past 3 months. The status of securing approval of contracts with New England electric distribution companies is on Slide 12. Following an RFP this past fall that attracted a number of bids, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in December seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. The 2 utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. National Grid's 2 Massachusetts electric distribution companies, Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric, made a similar filing with the DPU on January 15. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for nearly 45% of the Access Northeast targeted capacity.
In Connecticut, the natural gas capacity RFP will be run by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection or DEEP. We expect this process to be complete later this year.
In New Hampshire, the Public Utilities Commission issued an order in January 19, in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the PUC had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts are shown to be in the customers' interest. If the PUC commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest.
In Maine, where regulators have engaged on the natural gas contracting issue for some time, bidders were given an opportunity to refresh their proposals in December. State regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by midyear.
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in November. At the same time, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies issued their RFP. We expect National Grid to make a decision and file in the coming months with Rhode Island.
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation has yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be concluded this fall so that we can file our formal application with FERC before the end of 2016. We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy supply challenges.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 14, I'll start by covering our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the year, our 2016 outlook and long-term EPS growth expectations through 2019, account regulatory developments in the absence of rate case activity for the next 12 to 18 months. And I'll conclude with a brief overview of how we've delivered on the commitments that we made to investors in recent years.
Let's start with the fourth quarter. As you can see from Slide 15, earnings, excluding integration costs, was $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with earnings of $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.60 per share is consistent with the guidance that we gave on the third quarter earnings call and consistent with the updated street estimates that have been published this year.
Electric distribution and generation earnings declined by $0.07 per share to $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter 2015. Higher retail electric revenue, mostly due to the December 2014 Connecticut Light & Power distribution rate decision, added about $0.05 per share to earnings. But that impact was offset by higher property taxes and depreciation expense due to higher plant balances and higher amortization expense due to the amortization of CL&P's deferred storm balance.
Earnings for NSTAR Electric and public service in New Hampshire, which do not have revenue decoupling, were lower due to milder weather. Earnings in this segment were also lower due to a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. 
On a consolidated basis, our effective rate -- tax rate was approximately 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 35.4% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The higher rate lowered consolidated earnings in the quarter by about $0.04 per share. As expected, transmission earnings were down $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the absence of the fourth quarter 2014 reversal of a reserve related to FERC's review of the New England transmission ROEs.
The historically mild temperatures this past December were the primary reason for a $13.2 million or $0.04 per share decline in our natural gas segment earnings. Lower natural gas revenues alone cost us $0.03 per share despite having 2% more heating customers in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Average temperatures in Boston and Hartford were 10 to 12 degrees warmer than average in December. As a result, our firm natural gas sales were down 16% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a fairly mild fourth quarter of 2014. Parent and other improved by $0.02 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.
I'll now turn to full year results. Excluding integration charges, we earned $2.81 per share this year compared with $2.65 in 2014. 2015 results were consistent with our guidance of $2.80 to $2.85 per share and also consistent with recently updated street estimates. 
As you can see in the news release, the most significant driver of earnings growth in 2015 was higher electric revenue, which added $0.39 per share to our results compared with last year. The primary driver was approximately $150 million distribution rate increase for Connecticut Light & Power. We also benefited from a 0.3% increase in retail electric sales. Those higher revenues were offset in part by higher property taxes, depreciation and the CL&P storm amortization expense in 2015.
Higher electric transmission earnings also contributed to improved year-end results. Our transmission segment earned $0.96 per share in 2015 compared with $0.93 in 2014, benefiting in part from a higher level of investment in the business. 
As a result of our robust capital program, our transmission rate base was approximately $5.2 billion at the end of 2015 compared with $4.9 billion at the end of 2014. Those benefits were partially offset by FERC's decision last year to lower the base transmission ROE in New England to 10.57% from the previous 11.14% and to cap our ROEs on any reliability project, regardless of previously approved incentives, at 11.74%. As we've said in the past, those changes have reduced our effective transmission ROE, including incentives to approximately 11.5%.
Turning to our natural gas distribution business. After a very strong start, our year-end 2015 results were almost identical to those that we recorded in 2014. For the year, due to the warm fourth quarter, firm natural gas sales were down 1% after being up 8.4% in the first quarter of 2015.
On a weather-normalized basis, sales rose 2.5% for the year. Parent and other results were down $0.01 for the year. 
Two other items worth mentioning in 2015 were the benefits of lower O&M and the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. Lower and untracked O&M added $0.08 per share to earnings in 2015. This follows a $0.23 per share benefit in 2014 and a $0.05 per share benefit in 2013. Altogether, we have reduced our O&M by about $250 million since the merger closed in 2012.
Offsetting much of that benefit was the higher effective tax rate in 2015, which lowered earnings by about $0.06 per share as compared with the previous year. So in spite of the warm fourth quarter, we were still able to grow earnings for the year by $0.16 per share or 6% in 2015.
Turning from the financial slide to operations. As you can see on Slide 16, our key reliability statistics have dramatically improved and are record levels, as Tom mentioned. Since 2011, the number of months between interruptions and the speed of restoration when outages do occur have both improved by about 40%. We are well up in the top quartile of our peers and very proud of this accomplishment.
This closes our 2015 discussion. Let's move on to 2016. On Slide 17, you can see we've established an earnings per share range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. The biggest year-over-year benefit will come from the growth of our transmission rate base. The second biggest positive driver will be the natural gas segment. We expect that segment to benefit from a continued increase in natural gas heating customers; various capital initiatives, for which we have trackers; and a $15.8 million base rate increase that was effective at NSTAR Gas on January 1 of this year.
Other drivers include lower O&M. In the first quarter of this year, we will migrate our legacy payroll and benefit system to a single IT platform, which we've already done with our accounting and our outage management systems. Consolidating to a single system is expected to significantly improve efficiency and lower costs in the future. 
Offsetting these benefits are continued increases in depreciation, property taxes and modestly higher interest cost, reflecting continued investment in our distribution systems. 
From 2016, let's turn to the longer term in Slide 18. We estimate that we grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually over the 2015 to '19 forecast period. This compares with our previous growth rate of 6% to 8% for the 2014 to 2018 period. Nearly all of that change is attributable to the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation for tax purposes recently passed by progress -- Congress. We estimate that bonus depreciation alone is lowering our growth rate by approximately 1%.
Components of the 5% to 7% growth are similar to what has driven the 7.2% annual earnings growth since our 2012 merger. We've also noted our key assumptions about major projects, which include the completion of Northern Pass in 2019 and the construction of Access Northeast in 2018 and '19. Because significant Access Northeast construction is expected to continue beyond our forecast period, we anticipate that it will contribute to earnings growth in both 2020 and 2021 as well. Electric transmission capital expenditures and rate base growth are the primary drivers of our attractive earnings growth projection. 
Turning to Slide 19. You can see that capital expenditure projections are up significantly from the forecast we showed you a year ago. To begin, I should note that our transmission capital expenditures totaled $807 million in 2015. That's about $67 million above our projection at this time last year. We now show nearly $5 billion of electric transmission investment from 2015 through 2019. As we do every year, we have again identified transmission investments that we didn't have in the plan 1 year ago. We've added about $800 million of new investment. $200 million of that increase involves our previously announced increase in the Northern Pass project. We are projecting transmission capital expenditures of $911 million in 2016, $880 million of which will be spent on reliability-related transmission projects at our 4 regulated electric companies.
Two of the largest initiatives, the Greater Boston and Greater Hartford projects, involve dozens of individual projects and are described more fully in the transmission slides in our appendix. Those expenditures are helping to drive the significant improvements in reliability and transmission earnings growth in 2016.
You can see that we expect little capital spending on Northern Pass in 2016, but considerable expenditures in 2017 and '18, consistent with the schedule that we gave you earlier. These capital expenditure projections do not reflect our spending on the Clean Energy Connect project we discussed earlier, which we expect to contribute to earnings growth from 2018 to 2021.
We continue to work on both Clean Energy Connect and other potential projects that we expect to be approved. As a result, the arrow on the slides shows that we do not expect a significant decline in transmission spending in 2019, but we have not included all of the potential projects that are likely to be built that year. Because we are in a competitive bidding process, we are not providing a total cost of the Clean Energy Connect project or a year-by-year estimate of capital expenditures. We hope to provide that to you should the project be selected.
Let's turn to Slide 20. On the left-hand side, the slide shows our capital program, excluding both Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect. From 2016 through 2019, we expect to invest $9.2 billion in New England's energy infrastructure, including $3.9 billion in transmission that I mentioned earlier. You can see that electric and natural gas distribution capital total about $1.2 billion every year during that period. A slide in the appendix shows that investments in our natural gas delivery system will comprise a rising percentage of that investment. On the right-hand side, we have estimated the pace of our $1.2 billion projected investment in the Access Northeast project, which costs a total of $3 billion. Our FERC application indicates that elements of Access Northeast will be phased into service between late 2018 and 2021. 
On Slide 21, we illustrate how the composition of our rate base is expected to change by the end of 2019. About $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion of rate base growth over the next 4 years is expected to come from electric transmission. By the end of 2019, we expect that electric transmission will comprise 42% of our total rate base. And if our Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect investments were included, it puts us at nearly 50% FERC-regulated company by the end of 2019. We believe that this rising percentage of FERC investments will result in an increasing ROE to Eversource Energy as a whole. 
Slide 22 shows various initiatives that we expect to continue beyond our current full year forecast. As I said earlier, we expect significant expenditures on Access Northeast, Clean Energy Connect and other projects we are working on. We also expect continued work on modernizing the electric grid in Massachusetts, assuming our $430 million 5-year plan and capital tracker are approved by the state regulators we expect later this year. Our other initiatives are primarily tied to growing our natural gas distribution business.
Turning to Slide 23. You can see that despite declining oil prices, we added 11,415 new natural gas customers in 2015. This is about 7.5% ahead of 2014 and 4% ahead of our target for the year. The slide shows that we expect new heating customer growth to continue to accelerate over our forecast period and eventually reach about 16,000 per year, significantly aided by legislatively endorsed initiatives in both Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 2016, we're projecting approximately 12,500 new natural gas heating customers. And Tom mentioned that 1 month into the year, we're on plan.
Schedule 24 -- Slide 24 reviews 2 important regulatory items that are currently pending. Hearings on the divestiture of our New Hampshire generation fleet were completed this week, and we expect the decision within the next 2 months. Last week, a settlement was filed with certain advisory staff at the New Hampshire PUC who had earlier supported a delay to the sale. They now support near-term divestiture. Should the New Hampshire PUC authorize the divestiture, we expect the sale process and securitization to be completed later this year and early next year. As a reminder, we expect full recovery of approximately $700 million invested in New Hampshire generation by early 2017. 
In December, the FERC administrative law judge handling the second and third New England transmission ROE complaints requested some additional briefing on an aspect of the second complaint. So an initial recommendation by that ALJ was delayed from December 2015 to the end of March 2016. Because of that 3-month delay by the ALJ, we now expect to receive a decision from FERC on the 2 complaints in either late 2016 or early 2017.
As you can see on Slide 25, we have no general rate cases currently pending for any of our 6 regulated distribution utilities. And while we do expect rate case activity next year, we expect that any decisions would not impact our financial results until the end of 2017 or early 2018. So we have very good visibility into our distribution company results for the next 2 years.
Turning to this year's financing calendar, 2016 is likely to be similar to last year. One benefit of bonus depreciation, of course, is that it lowers our cash tax obligation. In 2016, we will receive an estimated $250 million to $300 million in refunds from taxes paid in 2015.
Additionally, we expect our cash tax liability for 2016 to be lowered by approximately $300 million as well. In 2017, bonus depreciation is estimated to lower our cash tax obligation by another $300 million.
Slide 26 shows the current distribution of S&P's electric utility credit ratings with Eversource as the only A-rated parent company as a result of our upgrade last year. We've also noted on the slide several positive outlooks on other subsidiaries at both -- for Fitch and Moody's.
Slide 27 shows the relative price performance of Eversource's shares versus the S&P 500 and the UTY since our merger was announced more than 4 years ago. We're very proud of our total shareholder return as well as our strong credit ratings. We strongly believe that financial strength and attractive shareholder returns can certainly both coexist and do at Eversource.
Slide 28 sums up what we have delivered to customers, policymakers and investors over the past 4 years. We committed that we'd exceed industry earnings per share and dividend growth rates, and we delivered with growth rates that are 2x the industry average for 3 years. We targeted O&M reductions of 3% to 4%, and we achieved 5% per year for 3 years on average. We said we'd maintain the strong financial condition. We've done better than maintain. 3 upgrades since the merger announcement has us with the only single A credit in the industry. We committed to top-tier service and reliability. A 40% improvement in reliability has us now consistently in the top quartile of our peers. We committed to grow and leverage our transmission and gas business. This morning, we've discussed the great portfolio of projects that will continue that great growth. And finally, advancing energy policy in the region, our Access Northeast project, Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect are game changers, cost-effectively advancing the region's carbon reduction agenda effectively.
Eversource continues to be a very attractive offering for investors, and we're confident that we'll continue to be in the years ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff."

And we're obviously a purely regulated T&D company, so it does impact our ability to earn. And I've seen a number of estimates out there, where companies have -- analysts have estimated that it's about a 1% increase on a company -- decrease on a company like Eversource. I would tell you this that as you well know that we have a long track record -- Tom and I, 20 years -- of delivering on guidance, either meeting or exceeding it. And the other thing that I've mentioned is we tend to provide data to the street, forecasted data, capital expenditure data, that ties out to the dollar to projects that we have in the Q. So we have obviously updated the forecast for the projects that we have. And the impact has been a 5% to 7% growth rate is a better guidance for Wall Street, a more credible guidance in the 6% to 8% that we had previously. That being said, I'll tell you that a year ago, we didn't provide capital expenditure numbers for Access Northeast. And look how long that project -- how far along that project has come. 3 months ago at our third quarter call, we didn't provide any guidance. Clean Energy Connect wasn't even mentioned as a project, and we now have that before the regulator to be approved. So we tend to find projects going forward. We don't put them into our plan until they're real. So I think we have a very credible 5% to 7% with some upside going forward."

If anything is new construction anywhere in our territory, they want natural gas for heating. It actually adds value to the house. There's studies that show that houses are selling for $10,000 or $20,000 more if, instead of having an old oil tank on your property, you have a pipe without trucks pulling up and down your street. But we're seeing lots of communities that are actually encouraging us to come in and help them reduce their carbon footprint. We call it the 3Ps. They don't require us to make permit fees. They don't require us to have police details. And on paving, they don't make us pave curb to curb. Typically, when you go in and cut a street to put a pipe down in for a neighborhood, they want you to pave curb to curb. They'll say, ""Hey, we'll let you patch that cut and therefore reduce the price to come in and bring this gas to our neighbor."" So interestingly, the demand is still there. But as you say, the payback for a customer is quite different. And therefore, you have to find different ways to turn it into a monthly payment rather than a big lump sum."

I have the easy job this morning of making the introductions. And let me start by saying, surprise, surprise, we've had another great year.

And let me start by saying, surprise, surprise, we've had another great year. Jim, in a minute, will take you through all the numbers to explain that, and Lee will take you through the significant big capital projects that we have, and they will both report on great progress. So we're moving along quite nicely. 
One of the things that we have been focusing on for the past 4 years is customer service. Those of you that know me, I'm a nut about customer service. And I think that in 2016, operationally, we had the best ever year with record reliability, record number of customers we were able to connect into our gas system. And we think we did that at a time when the delivery part of our bills have been very, very stable.
In 2016, we think we're going to bring it to the next level. We're focused on the customer touch points. We have successfully implemented a new outage management system throughout the 3 states so that, if you will, our order entry system is consistent at -- for all 3.5 million of our customers. And with this technology, which has great connectivity between our customers and our electrical components, we're going to be able to take it to the next level with a communication strategy that will let the customers know exactly what's going on at all times with their system and their connections. We're also going to be rolling out a new bill, new website -- again, important interactions with the customer that we think are the key to our success long term. 
For the region, as you know, it's an exciting time in New England. We are in a very unique phase. I think just last week, Gordon van Welie, who runs ISO New England, made a great presentation to the business community. And its focus was the needs going forward. And a critical first thing that he addressed is the gas infrastructure needs, showed the difference between our pricing and New England -- excuse me, and New York and other regions in the winter time frames when our gas infrastructure experiences constraints. And whether gas prices are high or gas prices are low, the differential is very significant. He also talked about the transmission system and the impacts that are going to be felt as we, as a region, meet our carbon reduction goals and move almost 35% or more than 35% of our fossil generation over the renewable generation. And so an exciting time, and we're right in the middle of that, and we'll talk more about that. 
And for investors, of course, you know that we work for you. The foundation for TSR, which we measure very carefully, is growing earnings per share and growing dividends. And that's what we'll talk to you about, our ability to continue that as we go forward. And as we do that, we think we will provide attractive returns while maintaining the highest credit rating in the industry.
If you flip to Page 4, my favorite slide in the deck, we continue to outperform our peers in the market over the long term. Last year was kind of a flat year. We do believe we did better than the industry. And as you can see by the bottom chart, as long as we keep our dividends growing -- and this week we raised our dividend 6.6% or $0.11. And despite that, we still, as you know, have a very modest payout ratio.
I won't dwell on those numbers, although I do like to. The last slide I just would mention before I turn it over to Lee is Page 5. And we're really quite proud of this. We've grown into a role as a regional leader. I meant -- I referenced the recent ISO New England presentation that Gordon made and their view on the regional challenges. But what has been very interesting, and Lee's in the center of all this, that as the largest player in New England, we seem to be the one that everybody comes to when they think they can help our customers in the region achieve our energy goals. And so we're working with several partners to help create the solutions that will bring us to the modern era, whether that's the pipeline constraints that I mentioned. Again, we think we have the best project and the best partner in the form of Spectra Energy, that allows us to use existing facilities that pass by every one of our most efficient, new gas-fired units in New England. And with our plan, we'll keep those units in the competitive queue each and every day of the winter. On the renewable energy side, we think we have -- and there, we'll probably talk a little bit more about the 3-state RFP. But as we look at that, we think we have really the only dispatchable project that can flow a substantial amount, no pun intended, of carbon-free energy into the region at the peak times that will again affect pricing in the queue. Whether it's the oil heat dependency that, in particular in Connecticut, is a key program in the Connecticut energy policy, we found this year that despite the fact that the gap between oil and gas shrunk considerably, that people still want to convert, and we were able to convert about 11,000 customers last year. And I think we already converted 1,000 in January. So the mild weather, while we don't like it from a sales perspective, allows us to continue and get a lot of work done. 
And of course, the forefront of everything in New England in terms of solving our energy problems and backing out carbon is energy efficiency. It's the cheapest way to achieve our objective. We have award-winning EE programs. As the slide says, we spend $0.5 billion a year. But last year, we actually exceeded our goals -- spent less, exceeded our megawatt-hour goals and had our incentives. We exceeded our plan by about $5 million on the incentive side. So we're very proud of that. The bottom line is we want our customers to see us as the solution to their energy concerns. And that's why it's an exciting place to be, New England, and for us to be in the center of all this. 
And with that, I know you would like to hear more about the projects. Every time I'm in front of a group, they want to ask about Northern Pass or Access Northeast, and even my board is always interested in what's going on with the project.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Lee to give you more flavor and a progress report on where we are with some of this stuff."

I'll provide you a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call over to Jim.
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 7. In December, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, determined that our Northern Pass application is complete and commenced the formal review process. As part of that process, the SEC held 5 public information sessions on the project in January and will hold another round of public hearings later this quarter. Simultaneously, we continue to respond to questions about the project from the multiple state agencies that are participating in the review. As you can see from Slide 8, we expect the New Hampshire SEC to vote on the Northern Pass consistent with its current schedule, which concludes on December 19.
In parallel, U.S. Department of Energy will host a series of 4 public hearings on its draft Environmental Impact Statement, or EIS, on Northern Pass the week of March 7. Two of them will be held jointly with the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee. 
Written comments on the draft EIS are due to the DOE by April 4. We expect the DOE to finalize the EIS in the second half of this year and anticipate a presidential permit issued soon after the New Hampshire SEC process has concluded. That time table has not changed, and we ensure that all relevant conditions of the SEC decision will be reflected in the presidential permit as well.
We continue to feel very good about the review process on Northern Pass. We're receiving strong support for the project, both inside and outside of New Hampshire. At the first public information session last month in Franklin, New Hampshire, where the DC-to-AC converter station will be located, we received significant support from local leaders, the business community and labor representatives.
In Massachusetts, Governor Baker said in his State of the State speech last month that increasing access to affordable hydroelectric power was the top priority of his administration. As Jim will discuss in a few moments, our new capital expenditure forecast reflects the revised $1.6 billion of cost of the project we announced in October and also allows the vast majority of the construction to take place in 2017 and 2018. As you probably know, Northern Pass is 1 of 2 projects connected to Eversource that were built into the -- bid into the joint state RFP. 
As shown on Slide 9, the other project is the Clean Energy Connect. This project involves construction of the new 600-megawatt, 25-mile transmission line between a transmission substation we own in Hinsdale, Massachusetts and a transmission substation in Easton, New York state. This project will utilize back-to-back HVDC converters to ensure deliverability into New England. We are developing it with Brookfield and Iberdrola and EDP Renewables. These partners already have a presence in New York, they've not been specific about the cost. But our share, which is entirely a transmission investment, will be more than $400 million.
If approved, as part of the RFP, we expect this project to be built in the 2018 through 2020 time frame and for our investment to earn returns consistent with FERC-regulated transmission investments. Each of the 3 states involved in the Clean Energy RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, will go through a process to select the winning bids and submit them to regulators for approval. The RFP schedule is on Slide 10.
As you can see, we expect contracts with the successful bidders to be executed by the end of the third quarter and for the contracts to be approved by the end of this year. We believe that the 2 projects we are jointly proposing represent the region's best options for low-cost, firm, reliable and noncarbon-emitting resources.
Regarding Northern Pass, our bids into the RFP does not change in any respect to significant benefits this project will provide to the host state of New Hampshire. Our Forward New Hampshire Plan remains in place. We anticipate $80 million per year in energy savings to New Hampshire; additional savings specific to New Hampshire as a result of a power purchase agreement with HQ; a commitment to hire New Hampshire workers first; a $200 million fund to support economic development and community initiatives; as well as other benefits.
I'll now turn to Slide 11. In the Access Northeast project, we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts to bring firm gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of the Access Northeast project is 40% or $1.2 billion. FERC has accepted the prefiling we made last year, and we are continuing to submit information on the project to FERC as part of that process.
In January, staff completed 13 -- FERC staff completed 13 open houses on the project in the region. We plan to make our formal application filing late this year to meet our initial in-service date of 2018. The project is designed to add 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient and low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter, and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as 2013, 2014. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will grow as new proposed plants are built. 
The project allows direct, last-mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business models at the electric utility signed pipeline capacity contracts for up to 20 years with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently unable to run the units during cold weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. The large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the needs of natural gas generators. We can depend less on more costly and higher emitting coal and oil plants that typically run when the region's natural gas supplies run shut.
We have made significant progress in the past 3 months. The status of securing approval of contracts with New England electric distribution companies is on Slide 12. Following an RFP this past fall that attracted a number of bids, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in December seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. The 2 utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. National Grid's 2 Massachusetts electric distribution companies, Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric, made a similar filing with the DPU on January 15. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for nearly 45% of the Access Northeast targeted capacity.
In Connecticut, the natural gas capacity RFP will be run by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection or DEEP. We expect this process to be complete later this year.
In New Hampshire, the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19, in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the PUC had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts are shown to be in the customers' interest. If the PUC commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest.
In Maine, where regulators have engaged on the natural gas contracting issue for some time, bidders were given an opportunity to refresh their proposals in December. State regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by midyear.
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in November. At the same time, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies issued their RFP. We expect National Grid to make a decision and file in the coming months with Rhode Island.
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation has yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be concluded this fall so that we can file our formal application with FERC before the end of 2016. We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy supply challenges.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Turning to Slide 14, I'll start by covering our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the year, our 2016 outlook and long-term EPS growth expectations through 2019, account regulatory developments in the absence of rate case activity for the next 12 to 18 months. And I'll conclude with a brief overview of how we've delivered on the commitments that we made to investors in recent years.
Let's start with the fourth quarter. As you can see from Slide 15, earnings, excluding integration costs, was $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with earnings of $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.60 per share is consistent with the guidance that we gave on the third quarter earnings call and consistent with the updated street estimates that have been published this year.
Electric distribution and generation earnings declined by $0.07 per share to $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter 2015. Higher retail electric revenue, mostly due to the December 2014 Connecticut Light & Power distribution rate decision, added about $0.05 per share to earnings. But that impact was offset by higher property taxes and depreciation expense due to higher plant balances and higher amortization expense due to the amortization of CL&P's deferred storm balance.
Earnings for NSTAR Electric and public service in New Hampshire, which do not have revenue decoupling, were lower due to milder weather. Earnings in this segment were also lower due to a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. 
On a consolidated basis, our effective rate -- tax rate was approximately 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 35.4% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The higher rate lowered consolidated earnings in the quarter by about $0.04 per share. As expected, transmission earnings were down $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the absence of the fourth quarter 2014 reversal of a reserve related to FERC's review of the New England transmission ROEs.
The historically mild temperatures this past December were the primary reason for a $13.2 million or $0.04 per share decline in our natural gas segment earnings. Lower natural gas revenues alone cost us $0.03 per share despite having 2% more heating customers in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Average temperatures in Boston and Hartford were 10 to 12 degrees warmer than average in December. As a result, our firm natural gas sales were down 16% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a fairly mild fourth quarter of 2014. Parent and other improved by $0.02 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.
I'll now turn to full year results. Excluding integration charges, we earned $2.81 per share this year compared with $2.65 in 2014. 2015 results were consistent with our guidance of $2.80 to $2.85 per share and also consistent with recently updated street estimates. 
As you can see in the news release, the most significant driver of earnings growth in 2015 was higher electric revenue, which added $0.39 per share to our results compared with last year. The primary driver was approximately $150 million distribution rate increase for Connecticut Light & Power. We also benefited from a 0.3% increase in retail electric sales. Those higher revenues were offset in part by higher property taxes, depreciation and the CL&P storm amortization expense in 2015.
Higher electric transmission earnings also contributed to improved year-end results. Our transmission segment earned $0.96 per share in 2015 compared with $0.93 in 2014, benefiting in part from a higher level of investment in the business. 
As a result of our robust capital program, our transmission rate base was approximately $5.2 billion at the end of 2015 compared with $4.9 billion at the end of 2014. Those benefits were partially offset by FERC's decision last year to lower the base transmission ROE in New England to 10.57% from the previous 11.14% and to cap our ROEs on any reliability project, regardless of previously approved incentives, at 11.74%. As we've said in the past, those changes have reduced our effective transmission ROE, including incentives to approximately 11.5%.
Turning to our natural gas distribution business. After a very strong start, our year-end 2015 results were almost identical to those that we recorded in 2014. For the year, due to the warm fourth quarter, firm natural gas sales were down 1% after being up 8.4% in the first quarter of 2015.
On a weather-normalized basis, sales rose 2.5% for the year. Parent and other results were down $0.01 for the year. 
Two other items worth mentioning in 2015 were the benefits of lower O&M and the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. Lower and nontracked O&M added $0.08 per share to earnings in 2015. This follows a $0.23 per share benefit in 2014 and a $0.05 per share benefit in 2013. Altogether, we have reduced our O&M by about $250 million since the merger closed in 2012.
Offsetting much of that benefit was the higher effective tax rate in 2015, which lowered earnings by about $0.06 per share as compared with the previous year. So in spite of the warm fourth quarter, we were still able to grow earnings for the year by $0.16 per share or 6% in 2015.
Turning from the financial slide to operations. As you can see on Slide 16, our key reliability statistics have dramatically improved and are record levels, as Tom mentioned. Since 2011, the number of months between interruptions and the speed of restoration when outages do occur have both improved by about 40%. We are well up in the top quartile of our peers and very proud of this accomplishment.
This closes our 2015 discussion. Let's move on to 2016. On Slide 17, you can see we've established an earnings per share range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. The biggest year-over-year benefit will come from growth of our transmission rate base. The second biggest positive driver will be the natural gas segment. We expect that segment to benefit from a continued increase in natural gas heating customers; various capital initiatives, for which we have trackers; and a $15.8 million base rate increase that was effective at NSTAR Gas on January 1 of this year.
Other drivers include lower O&M. In the first quarter of this year, we will migrate our legacy payroll and benefit system to a single IT platform, which we've already done with our accounting and our outage management systems. Consolidating to a single system is expected to significantly improve efficiency and lower costs in the future. 
Offsetting these benefits are continued increases in depreciation, property taxes and modestly higher interest cost, reflecting continued investment in our distribution systems. 
From 2016, let's turn to the longer term in Slide 18. We estimate that we grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually over the 2015 to '19 forecast period. This compares with our previous growth rate of 6% to 8% for the 2014 to 2018 period. Nearly all of that change is attributable to the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation for tax purposes recently passed by progress -- Congress. We estimate that bonus depreciation alone is lowering our growth rate by approximately 1%.
Components of the 5% to 7% growth are similar to what has driven the 7.2% annual earnings growth since our 2012 merger. We've also noted our key assumptions about major projects, which include the completion of Northern Pass in 2019 and the construction of Access Northeast in 2018 and '19. Because significant Access Northeast construction is expected to continue beyond our forecast period, we anticipate that it will contribute to earnings growth in both 2020 and 2021 as well. Electric transmission capital expenditures and rate base growth are the primary drivers of our attractive earnings growth projection. 
Turning to Slide 19. You can see that capital expenditure projections are up significantly from the forecast we showed you a year ago. To begin, I should note that our transmission capital expenditures totaled $807 million in 2015. That's about $67 million above our projection at this time last year. We now show nearly $5 billion of electric transmission investment from 2015 through 2019. As we do every year, we have again identified transmission investments that we didn't have in the plan 1 year ago. We've added about $800 million of new investment. $200 million of that increase involves our previously announced increase in the Northern Pass project. We are projecting transmission capital expenditures of $911 million in 2016, $880 million of which will be spent on reliability-related transmission projects at our 4 regulated electric companies.
Two of the largest initiatives, the Greater Boston and Greater Hartford projects, involve dozens of individual projects and are described more fully in the transmission slides in our appendix. Those expenditures are helping to drive the significant improvements in reliability and transmission earnings growth in 2016.
You can see that we expect little capital spending on Northern Pass in 2016, but considerable expenditures in 2017 and '18, consistent with the schedule that Lee gave you earlier. These capital expenditure projections do not reflect our spending on the Clean Energy Connect project Lee discussed earlier, which we expect to contribute to earnings growth from 2018 to 2021.
We continue to work on both Clean Energy Connect and other potential projects that we expect to be approved. As a result, the arrow on the slides shows that we do not expect a significant decline in transmission spending in 2019, but we have not included all of the potential projects that are likely to be built that year. Because we are in a competitive bidding process, we are not providing a total cost of the Clean Energy Connect project or a year-by-year estimate for capital expenditures. We hope to provide that to you should the project be selected.
Let's turn to Slide 20. On the left-hand side, this slide shows our capital program, excluding both Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect. From 2016 through 2019, we expect to invest $9.2 billion in New England's energy infrastructure, including $3.9 billion in transmission that I mentioned earlier. You can see that electric and natural gas distribution capital total about $1.2 billion every year during that period. A slide in the appendix shows that investments in our natural gas delivery system will comprise a rising percentage of that investment. On the right-hand side, we have estimated the pace of our $1.2 billion projected investment in the Access Northeast project, which costs a total of $3 billion. Our FERC application indicates that elements of Access Northeast will be phased into service between late 2018 and 2021. 
On Slide 21, we illustrate how the composition of our rate base is expected to change by the end of 2019. About $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion of rate base growth over the next 4 years is expected to come from electric transmission. By the end of 2019, we expect that electric transmission will comprise 42% of our total rate base. And if our Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect investments were included, it puts us at nearly 50% FERC-regulated company by the end of 2019. We believe that this rising percentage of FERC investments will result in an increasing ROE to Eversource Energy as a whole. 
Slide 22 shows various initiatives that we expect to continue beyond our current full year forecast. As I said earlier, we expect significant expenditures on Access Northeast, Clean Energy Connect and other projects we are working on. We also expect continued work on modernizing the electric grid in Massachusetts, assuming our $430 million 5-year plan and capital tracker are approved by the state regulators we expect later this year. Our other initiatives are primarily tied to growing our natural gas distribution business.
Turning to Slide 23. You can see that despite declining oil prices, we added 11,415 new natural gas customers in 2015. This is about 7.5% ahead of 2014 and 4% ahead of our target for the year. The slide shows that we expect new heating customer growth to continue to accelerate over our forecast period and eventually reach about 16,000 per year, significantly aided by legislatively endorsed initiatives in both Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 2016, we're projecting approximately 12,500 new natural gas heating customers. And Tom mentioned that 1 month into the year, we're on plan.
Schedule 24 -- Slide 24 reviews 2 important regulatory items that are currently pending. Hearings on the divestiture of our New Hampshire generation fleet were completed this week, and we expect the decision within the next 2 months. Last week, a settlement was filed with certain advisory staff at the New Hampshire PUC who had earlier supported a delay to the sale. They now support near-term divestiture. Should the New Hampshire PUC authorize the divestiture, we expect the sale process and securitization to be completed later this year and early next year. As a reminder, we expect full recovery of approximately $700 million invested in New Hampshire generation by early 2017. 
In December, the FERC administrative law judge handling the second and third New England transmission ROE complaints requested some additional briefing on an aspect of the second complaint. So an initial recommendation by that ALJ was delayed from December 2015 to the end of March 2016. Because of that 3-month delay by the ALJ, we now expect to receive a decision from FERC on the 2 complaints in either late 2016 or early 2017.
As you can see on Slide 25, we have no general rate cases currently pending for any of our 6 regulated distribution utilities. And while we do expect rate case activity next year, we expect that any decisions would not impact our financial results until the end of 2017 or early 2018. So we have very good visibility into our distribution company results for the next 2 years.
Turning to this year's financing calendar, 2016 is likely to be similar to last year. One benefit of bonus depreciation, of course, is that it lowers our cash tax obligation. In 2016, we will receive an estimated $250 million to $300 million in refunds from taxes paid in 2015.
Additionally, we expect our cash tax liability for 2016 to be lowered by approximately $300 million as well. In 2017, bonus depreciation is estimated to lower our cash tax obligation by another $300 million.
Slide 26 shows the current distribution of S&P's electric utility credit ratings with Eversource as the only A-rated parent company as a result of our upgrade last year. We've also noted on the slide several positive outlooks on other subsidiaries at both -- for Fitch and Moody's.
Slide 27 shows the relative price performance of Eversource's shares versus the S&P 500 and the UTY since our merger was announced more than 4 years ago. We're very proud of our total shareholder return as well as our strong credit ratings. We strongly believe that financial strength and attractive shareholder returns can certainly both coexist and do at Eversource.
Slide 28 sums up what we have delivered to customers, policymakers and investors over the past 4 years. We committed that we'd exceed industry earnings per share and dividend growth rates, and we delivered with growth rates that are 2x the industry average for 3 years. We targeted O&M reductions of 3% to 4%, and we achieved 5% per year for 3 years on average. We said we'd maintain the strong financial condition. We've done better than maintain. Three upgrades since the merger announcement has us with the only single A credit in the industry. We committed to top-tier service and reliability. A 40% improvement in reliability has us now consistently in the top quartile of our peers. We committed to grow and leverage our transmission and gas business. This morning, we've discussed the great portfolio of projects that will continue that great growth. And finally, advancing energy policy in the region, our Access Northeast project, Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect are game changers, cost-effectively advancing the region's carbon reduction agenda effectively.
Eversource continues to be a very attractive offering for investors, and we're confident that we'll continue to be in the years ahead.

I would tell you this, that as you well know, that we have a long track record, Tom and I, 20 years of delivering on guidance, either meeting or exceeding it. And the other thing that I've mentioned is we tend to provide data to the street, forecasted data, capital expenditure data, that ties out to the dollar to projects that we have in the queue. So we have obviously updated the forecast for the projects that we have. And the impact has been a 5% to 7% growth rate is a better guidance for Wall Street, a more credible guidance in the 6% to 8% that we had previously. That being said, I'll tell you that a year ago, we didn't provide capital expenditure numbers for Access Northeast. And look how long that project -- how far along that project has come. Three months ago at our third quarter call, we didn't provide any guidance. Clean Energy Connect wasn't even mentioned as a project, and we now have that before the regulator to be approved. So we tend to find projects going forward. We don't put them into our plan until they're real. So I think we have a very credible 5% to 7% with some upside going forward."

There's studies that show that houses are selling for $10,000 or $20,000 more if, instead of having an old oil tank on your property, you have a pipe without trucks pulling up and down your street. But we're seeing lots of communities that are actually encouraging us to come in and help them reduce their carbon footprint. We call it the 3Ps. They don't require us to make permit fees. They don't require us to have police details. And on paving, they don't make us pave curb to curb. Typically, when you go in and cut a street to put a pipe down in for a neighborhood, they want you to pave curb to curb. They'll say, ""Hey, we'll let you patch that cut and therefore reduce the price to come in and bring this gas to our neighbor."" So interestingly, the demand is still there.

Tom's record of providing value and service to customers and investors as CEO first of Boston Edison then Enstar Northeast Utilities and Eversource Energy was unsurpassed in our industry. I was both honored and tremendously excited by being our board's choice to succeed him. 
This company has a tremendous future ahead. We continue to identify investment opportunities to enable our regions to successfully implement the state and federal energy policies that continue to shape our region. We also have what I consider to be the best group of 8,000 employees in the industry and a very talented and very experienced management team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our investors as our company continues to deliver to you attractive returns by providing the highest level of service to customers.

Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $2",1254,"Thanks, Phil. Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. 
Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $244 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $253 million or $0.80 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Both of those are GAAP numbers since we are no longer separating our merger integration costs in reporting our results. These results represent a solid start to 2016 despite the very mild weather in the first quarter. These results also support our full year EPS estimate of $2.90 to $3.05 per share, as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Our transmission segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $0.21 per share in the first quarter last year. The first of 2 principal drivers of that increase was the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 after FERC issued its final decision in the First New England transmission ROE complaint. The second factor was the earnings growth we are experiencing as a result of our continued investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. That rate base growth added $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2016. 
On the electric distribution side, we earned $0.34 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2015. 3 principal factors contributed to this $0.07 per share reduction in earnings. The primary driver was the absence in 2016 of about $0.09 of benefits we realized in the first quarter last year from settling several long-standing dockets at NSTAR Electric. Milder weather in the first quarter of 2016 reduced earnings at NSTAR Electric and PSNH with distribution revenues are now fully decoupled and that cost us about $0.02 per share.
Partially offsetting those impacts were lower O&M and other items, including our second quarter 2015 accumulated deferred income tax settlement at Connecticut Light & Power. Altogether, those factors added about $0.04 per share in the first quarter.
On the natural gas distribution side, we earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Warmer weather was the principal factor with lower gas revenues costing us $0.05 per share despite a nearly $16 million annualized rate increase at Enstar gas.
We had a very cold first quarter in 2015 and a very mild first quarter in 2016. Heating degree days in the Boston area were 21% above normal in the first quarter of 2015, when NSTAR gas did not yet have decoupling. In Connecticut, where Yankee Gas is not yet decoupled, heating degree days were about 10% below normal in the first quarter this year compared with 18% [ph] above normal in the first quarter of 2015. The weather impact was partially offset by lower O&M, a rate increase at NSTAR gas and other factors that together added $0.03 per share to earnings. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $140 [ph] million in the first quarter of 2016 and we continue to target transmission capital investments of $911 million for the full year. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major reliability transmission projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: The Greater Boston Reliability Solutions; and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut solutions. We have now invested more than $130 million in those projects with many elements now completed, under construction and before regulators for approval. By 2019, we expect to invest $900 million in these comprehensive solutions to our regions' long-term reliability challenges.
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has a number of projects before it, including Northern Pass. Last month we filed application with the Site Evaluation Committee to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability Project in Southeast New Hampshire. We expect the decision on our application by mid-2017 and to complete the seacoast project by the end of 2018.
We also continue to expand our natural gas delivery system in the first quarter. We've added about 2,500 natural gas heating customers in the first quarter, up about 20% from the 2,050 we added in the first quarter of 2015 and very consistent with our full year 2016 goal of 12,500 new heating customers.
We added a 72nd town to the Yankee Gas Service territory, the town of Basra in Eastern Connecticut. And despite the mild winter, we did have 1 frigid weekend around Presidents' Day when both Yankee Gas and NSTAR gas set all-time records for the amount of natural gas delivered in a single day. On February 14, NSTAR gas delivered over 8.5% more natural gas to our customers than the previous record set back in January 2014. 
Now I will turn to our regulatory calendar in Slide 6. We are awaiting a decision from the New Hampshire PUC on a comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, PSNH generating rate base, including undepreciated plants, fuel and inventory totals approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered to the plant sale process will be recovered through securitization. We continue to expect the entire sale and securitization process to be completed by this time next year. 
Moving from New Hampshire to Washington. On March 22, the administrative law judge at FERC handling complaints #2 and complaint #3 involving the ROEs earned by all New England Transmission Owners issued his initial recommendation. For the 15-month refund period ended in March 2014, the 400-page recommendation called for a base ROE of 9.59% and a cap of 10.42%. For the 15-month period ending October 2015, the decision called for a base ROE of 10.9% and a cap of 12.19%. Our currently allowed ROE is 10.57% and our current cap is 11.74%. So if the FERC will deduct the ALJ recommendation, we would find ourselves underreserve-ed for the earlier period by $34 million after-tax and overreserved for the later refund period by $8 million after-tax. 
Because we cannot be certain how FERC commissioners will ultimately decide the case, we didn't book any charges this quarter due to the ALJ recommendation. We will re-examine the issue as this process moves forward. If FERC would adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would have a onetime net charge of approximately $0.08 per share. Going forward, however, we would earn a higher ROE of 10.9% compared with the current base of 10.57%.
Parties to the case filed ALJ recommendation on April 21. We continue to expect the final FERC position around the end of this year or early 2017. I should note that after 6 months of no additional complaints, our fourth complaint was filed this past Friday by Eastern Massachusetts Municipal Electric Companies. We await FERC action on this fourth [ph] complaint. 
Turning to financing. Eversource parent issued $500 million of senior notes in March, $250 million of 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.5% and $250 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 3.35%. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt. The issuances were several times oversubscribed and we're very pleased with the rates we received. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update in our major initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8.

I'll provide you with a brief update in our major initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according to schedule. March was an important month from this 10 point receiving public input on our project. A total of 7 public readings were held around this date in the month: 3 by the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee; 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy; and 2 jointly between these 2 primary permitting agencies. The Site Evaluation Committee will hold 2 additional public meetings on some follow-up items one later this month and another in June.
April 4th was the deadline for the written comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and we expect a final environmental impact statement from the DOE in the fourth quarter of this year. 
On the stateside, the New Hampshire SEC recently established a near-term schedule at the end of June, providing full commencement of the discovery process in mid-May. The dates are similar to what we had proposed. I under the state statute, we would expect the New Hampshire SEC to hold evidentiary hearings and issue a decision before the end of the year. We're aware that some intervenors have requested a more prolonged review period and we expect a ruling soon on those requests and establishment of a firm schedule. 
Assuming the final schedule is consistent with the statutory deadline, as you can see on Slide 9, it would support the issuance of a Presidential permit from the Department of Energy early next year and the commencement of the construction shortly thereafter. We continue to see support for the project building in New Hampshire and we were gratified by the number of favorable comments in the public meetings specifically from the labor and business communities of New Hampshire. We believe this is a sign of growing public support for the project and the billions of dollars in benefits it will bring to New Hampshire. As stated in our February earnings call, we bid both Northern Pass and the Clean Energy Connect into the 3 state electric ROP. Clean Energy Connect would allow 600 megawatts of carbon-free energy to flow from New York into New England. The review process for our projects and the other approximately 20 that were bid into the process continues and we expect the states involved in the RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, to announce the winning bids this summer. 
I will now turn to Slide 10, in the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in [indiscernible], Massachusetts, to bring firm natural gas supplies to power generators in New England.  Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion, with project that is designed to provide 900 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the 2013 and '14 period.
Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will soon grow as nearly 2,600 megawatts of new proposed plants are built and connected to the project.
Access Northeast allows direct mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business model is electric utility signed long-term contracts with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators or the market price. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently without fuel to run their units during cold winter weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used, primarily to heat homes and businesses. If a large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the fuel supply needs of natural gas generators, we can depend less on more costly and higher emitting coal and oil plants that typically operate when the region's natural gas supply are short. We continue to make significant progress on securing and seeking approval of contracts with New England electric distribution companies. The current status of the state reviews is on Slide 11.
You will recall the following RFP this past fall, NSTAR Electric, Western Mass Electric and 2 national grid electric distribution companies filed with the Massachusetts DPU seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. All our 2 utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. The DPU has established a schedule to review that filing that would support a decision in the early fall.
Evidentiary hearings on all of the contracts are scheduled for this summer. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for more than 40% of Access Northeast targeted capacity. 
In Connecticut, we expect the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a request for proposals for natural gas capacity shortly. We expect this process to be complete with approved contracts late this year or early in 2017.
In New Hampshire, you may recall that the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19, in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the Public Utility Commission had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts were shown to be in customer's interests. 
On February 18, Public Service of New Hampshire filed with state regulators a natural gas contract with Access Northeast that was similar to what the 4 Massachusetts electric utilities filed in their state. If the New Hampshire public utility commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest. A technical session on the docket schedule was held yesterday. We are optimistic that the commissions will agree with the staff that they have authority to approve a contract with Public Service of New Hampshire and Access Northeast. The PUC's consideration of whether the contracts provide benefits to customers would follow its legal ruling on the issues.
In Maine, where regulators have been engaged in natural gas contracting issue for some time, state regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by the early fall.
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in the fall, with bids received November 13, along the same time as the Massachusetts Electric Distribution companies have their RFP. We expect the National Grid to make a decision and file with Rhode Island regulators by early this summer. 
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure but their level of participation is yet to be determined. We expect that state processes will be sufficiently advanced by the end of this year so that we can promptly file our formal application with FERC and bring additional natural gas supplies into New England for the winter of 2018 to 2019.
We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy challenges. 
And now, I'd like to return the call back over to Jeff for any Q&A."

A very mild winter this quarter, resulting in a sales decline in the electric side of 8.5%. I would say that virtually all of that is weather driven.

And as we have future rate cases, we'll be decoupled everywhere, I expect. But we are forecasting flat on the electric side. But because of the gas conversions going on, we think it will be 2% to 3% growth in gas sales annually. And really, I think the primary driver to that flat growth is it's got nothing to do with the economy. In particular in the Boston area, the economy is moving with lots of construction going on. But we as a company spent $500 million a year, $0.5 billion a year on energy efficiency. And I think that has a significant impact, 2% impact, on the sales results for the company. Now fortunately, the ratemaking mechanism for energy efficiency spending makes us whole, either decoupling or large base revenues reimburse us. If we actually do a good job on the projects, we're able to earn an incentive. And at the same time, we're recovering our cost as we incur them each year. So the cash flow is positive as well. So we are worried not for energy efficiency. I think we'd be looking at 2% or higher sales volume growth."

Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $2",1258,"Thanks, Phil. Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. 
Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $244 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $253 million or $0.80 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Both of the -- those are GAAP numbers since we are no longer separating out merger integration costs in reporting our results. These results represent a solid start to 2016 despite the very mild weather in the first quarter. These results also support our full year EPS estimate of $2.90 to $3.05 per share, as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Our transmission segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $0.21 per share in the first quarter last year. The first of 2 principal drivers of that increase was the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 after FERC issued its final decision in the First New England transmission ROE complaint. The second factor was the earnings growth we are experiencing as a result of our continued investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. That rate base growth added $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2016. 
On the electric distribution side, we earned $0.34 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2015. 3 principal factors contributed to this $0.07 per share reduction in earnings. The primary driver was the absence in 2016 of about $0.09 of benefits we realized in the first quarter last year from settling several long-standing dockets at NSTAR Electric. Milder weather in the first quarter of 2016 reduced earnings at NSTAR Electric and PSNH where distribution revenues are not fully decoupled and that cost us about $0.02 per share.
Partially offsetting those impacts were lower O&M and other items, including our second quarter 2015 accumulated deferred income tax settlement at Connecticut Light & Power. Altogether, those factors added about $0.04 per share in the first quarter.
On the natural gas distribution side, we earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Warmer weather was the principal factor with lower gas revenues costing us $0.05 per share despite a nearly $16 million annualized rate increase at NSTAR Gas.
We had a very cold first quarter in 2015 and a very mild first quarter in 2016. Heating degree days in the Boston area were 21% above normal in the first quarter of 2015, when NSTAR Gas did not yet have decoupling. In Connecticut, where Yankee Gas is not yet decoupled, heating degree days were about 10% below normal in the first quarter this year compared with 18% above normal in the first quarter of 2015. The weather impact was partially offset by lower O&M, a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and other factors that together added $0.03 per share to earnings. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $140 million in the first quarter of 2016 and we continue to target transmission capital investments of $911 million for the full year. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major reliability transmission projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: The Greater Boston Reliability Solutions; and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. We have now invested more than $130 million in those projects with many elements now completed, under construction before regulators for approval. By 2019, we expect to invest $900 million in these comprehensive solutions to our regions' energy -- long-term reliability challenges.
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has a number of projects before it, including Northern Pass. Last month we filed application with the Site Evaluation Committee to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability Project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect the decision on our application by mid-2017 and to complete the Seacoast project by the end of 2018.
We also continue to expand our natural gas delivery system in the first quarter. We've added about 2,500 natural gas heating customers in the first quarter, up about 20% from the 2,050 we added in the first quarter of 2015 and very consistent with our full year 2016 goal of 12,500 new heating customers.
We added a 72nd town to the Yankee Gas Service territory, the town of Bozrah in Eastern Connecticut. And despite the mild winter, we did have 1 frigid weekend around Presidents' Day when both Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas set all-time records for the amount of natural gas delivered in a single day. On February 14, NSTAR Gas delivered over 8.5% more natural gas to our customers than the previous record set back in January 2014. 
Now I will turn to our regulatory calendar in Slide 6. We are awaiting a decision from the New Hampshire PUC on a comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, PSNH generating rate base, including undepreciated plants, fuel and inventory totals approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered to the plant sale process will be recovered through securitization. We continue to expect the entire sale and securitization process to be completed by this time next year. 
Moving from New Hampshire to Washington. On March 22, the administrative law judge at FERC handling complaints #2 and complaint #3 involving the ROEs earned by all New England Transmission Owners issued his initial recommendation. For the 15-month refund period ended in March 2014, the 400-page recommendation called for a base ROE of 9.59% and a cap of 10.42%. For the 15-month period ending October 2015, the decision called for a base ROE of 10.9% and a cap of 12.19%. Our currently allowed ROE is 10.57% and our current cap is 11.74%. So if the FERC would adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would find ourselves under-reserved for the earlier refund period by $34 million after-tax and over-reserved for the later refund period by $8 million after-tax. 
Because we cannot be certain how FERC commissioners will ultimately decide the case, we didn't book any charges this quarter due to the ALJ recommendation. We will re-examine the issue as this process moves forward. If FERC would adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would have a onetime net charge of approximately $0.08 per share. Going forward, however, we would earn a higher ROE of 10.9% compared with the current base of 10.57%.
Parties to the case filed comments on the ALJ recommendation on April 21. We continue to expect the final FERC decision around the end of this year or early 2017. I should note that after 6 months of no additional complaints, our fourth complaint was filed this past Friday by Eastern Massachusetts Municipal Electric Companies. We await FERC action on this fourth complaint. 
Turning to financing. Eversource parent issued $500 million of senior notes in March, $250 million of 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.5% and $250 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 3.35%. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt. The issuances were several times oversubscribed and we're very pleased with the rates we received. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update in our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according t",1273,"Okay. Thank you, Jim. I'll provide you with a brief update in our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according to schedule. March was an important month from this standpoint of receiving public input on our project. A total of 7 public meetings were held around this date in the month: 3 by the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee; 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy; and 2 jointly between these 2 primary permitting agencies. The Site Evaluation Committee will hold 2 additional public meetings on some follow-up items one later this month and another in June.
April 4th was the deadline for the written comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and we expect a final environmental impact statement from the DOE in the fourth quarter of this year. 
On the stateside, the New Hampshire SEC recently established a near-term schedule at the end of June, providing for a commencement of the discovery process in mid-May. The dates are similar to what we had proposed. Under the state statute, we would expect the New Hampshire SEC to hold evidentiary hearings and issue a decision before the end of the year. We're aware that some intervenors have requested a more prolonged review period and we expect a ruling soon on those requests and establishment of a firm schedule. 
Assuming the final schedule is consistent with the statutory deadline, as you can see on Slide 9, it would support the issuance of a Presidential permit from the Department of Energy early next year and the commencement of construction shortly thereafter. We continue to see support for the project building in New Hampshire and we were gratified by the number of favorable comments in the public meetings particularly from the labor and business communities of New Hampshire. We believe this is a sign of growing public support for the project and the billions of dollars in benefits it will bring to New Hampshire. As stated in our February earnings call, we bid both Northern Pass and the Clean Energy Connect into the 3 state electric RFP. Clean Energy Connect would allow 600 megawatts of carbon-free energy to flow from New York into New England. The review process for our projects and the other approximately 20 that were bid into the process continues and we expect the states involved in the RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, to announce the winning bids this summer. 
I will now turn to Slide 10, in the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts, to bring firm natural gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. The project is designed to provide 900 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the 2013 and '14 period.
Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will soon grow as nearly 2,600 megawatts of new proposed plants are built and connected to the project.
Access Northeast allows direct last-mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business model is at electric utility signed long-term contracts with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators or the market price. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently without fuel to run their units during cold winter weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used, primarily to heat homes and businesses. If a large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the fuel supply needs of natural gas generators, we can depend less on more costly and higher emitting coal and oil plants that typically operate when the region's natural gas supplies are short. We continue to make significant progress on securing and seeking approval of contracts with New England Electric distribution Companies. The current status of the state reviews is on Slide 11.
You will recall the following in RFP this past fall, NSTAR Electric, Western Mass Electric and 2 national grid electric distribution companies filed with the Massachusetts DPU seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. All our 2 utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. The DPU has established a schedule to review that filing that would support a decision in the early fall.
Evidentiary hearings on all of the contracts are scheduled for this summer. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for more than 40% of Access Northeast targeted capacity. 
In Connecticut, we expect the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a request for proposals for natural gas capacity shortly. We expect this process to be complete with approved contracts late this year or early in 2017.
In New Hampshire, you may recall that the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19, in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the Public Utility Commission had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts were shown to be in customers' interests. 
On February 18, Public Service of New Hampshire filed with state regulators a natural gas contract with Access Northeast that was similar to what the 4 Massachusetts electric utilities filed in their state. If the New Hampshire public utility commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest. A technical session on the docket schedule was held yesterday. We are optimistic that the commissioners will agree with the staff that they have authority to approve a contract with Public Service of New Hampshire and Access Northeast. The PUC's consideration of whether the contracts provide benefits to customers would follow its legal ruling on the issues.
In Maine, where regulators have been engaged in natural gas contracting issue for some time, state regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by the early fall.
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in the fall, with bids received November 13, along the same time as the Massachusetts Electric distribution companies had their RFP. We expect the National Grid to make a decision and file with Rhode Island regulators by early this summer. 
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure but its level of participation is yet to be determined. We expect that state processes will be sufficiently advanced by the end of this year so that we can promptly file our formal application with FERC and bring additional natural gas supplies into New England for the winter of 2018 to 2019.
We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy challenges. 
And now, I'd like to return the call back over to Jeff for any Q&As."

And as we have future rate cases, we'll be decoupled everywhere, I expect. But we are forecasting flat on the electric side. But because of the gas conversions going on, we think it will be 2% to 3% growth in gas sales annually. And really, I think the primary driver to that flat growth is -- got nothing to do with the economy. In particular in the Boston area, the economy is booming, there's lots of construction going on. But we as a company spent $500 million a year, $0.5 billion a year on energy efficiency. And I think that has a significant impact, 2% impact, on the sales results for the company. Now fortunately, the ratemaking mechanism for energy efficiency spending makes us whole, decoupling our loss space revenues, reimburse us. If we actually do a good job on the projects, we're able to earn an incentive. And at the same time, we're recovering our cost as we incur them each year. So the cash flow is positive as well. So were if not for energy efficiency, I think we'd be looking at 2% or higher sales volume growth."

Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $2",1261,"Thanks, Phil. Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. 
Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $244 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $253 million or $0.80 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Both of the -- those are GAAP numbers since we are no longer separating out merger integration costs in reporting our results. These results represent a solid start to 2016 despite the very mild weather in the first quarter. These results also support our full year EPS estimate of $2.90 to $3.05 per share as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Our transmission segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $0.21 per share in the first quarter last year. The first of 2 principal drivers of that increase was the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 after FERC issued its final decision in the First New England transmission ROE complaint. The second factor was the earnings growth we are experiencing as a result of our continued investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. That rate-based growth added $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2016. 
On the Electric Distribution side, we earned $0.34 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2015. 3 principal factors contributed to this $0.07 per share reduction in earnings. The primary driver was the absence in 2016 of about $0.09 of benefits we realized in the first quarter last year from settling several long-standing dockets at NSTAR Electric. Milder weather in the first quarter of 2016 reduced earnings at NSTAR Electric and PSNH where distribution revenues are not fully decoupled, and that cost us about $0.02 per share.
Partially offsetting those impacts were lower O&M and other items, including our second quarter 2015 accumulated deferred income tax settlement at Connecticut Light & Power. Altogether, those factors added about $0.04 per share in the first quarter.
On the Natural Gas Distribution side, we earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Warmer weather was the principal factor, with lower gas revenues costing us $0.05 per share despite a nearly $16 million annualized rate increase at NSTAR Gas.
We had a very cold first quarter in 2015 and a very mild first quarter in 2016. Heating degree days in the Boston area were 21% above normal in the first quarter of 2015, when NSTAR Gas did not yet have decoupling. In Connecticut, where Yankee Gas is not yet decoupled, heating degree days were about 10% below normal in the first quarter this year compared with 18% above normal in the first quarter of 2015. The weather impact was partially offset by lower O&M, a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and other factors that together added $0.03 per share to earnings. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $140 million in the first quarter of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of $911 million for the full year. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major reliability transmission projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. We have now invested more than $130 million in those projects, with many elements now completed, under construction or before regulators for approval. By 2019, we expect to invest $900 million in these comprehensive solutions to our regions' energy -- long-term reliability challenges.
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has a number of projects before it, including Northern Pass. Last month we filed application with the Site Evaluation Committee to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability Project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect a decision on our application by mid-2017 and to complete the Seacoast project by the end of 2018.
We also continued to expand our natural gas delivery system in the first quarter. We've added about 2,500 natural gas heating customers in the first quarter, up about 20% from the 2,050 we added in the first quarter of 2015 and very consistent with our full year 2016 goal of 12,500 new heating customers.
We added a 72nd town to the Yankee Gas Service territory, the town of Bozrah in Eastern Connecticut. And despite the mild winter, we did have 1 frigid weekend around Presidents' Day when both Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas set all-time records for the amount of natural gas delivered in a single day. On February 14, NSTAR Gas delivered over 8.5% more natural gas to our customers than the previous record set back in January 2014. 
Now I will turn to our regulatory calendar in Slide 6. We are awaiting a decision from the New Hampshire PUC on a comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, PSNH generating rate base, including undepreciated plants, fuel and inventory, totals approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process will be recovered through securitization. We continue to expect the entire sale and securitization process to be completed by this time next year. 
Moving from New Hampshire to Washington. On March 22, the administrative law judge at FERC handling complaints #2 and complaint #3 involving the ROEs earned by all New England Transmission Owners issued his initial recommendation. For the 15-month refund period ended in March 2014, the 400-page recommendation called for a base ROE of 9.59% and a cap of 10.42%. For the 15-month period ending October 2015, the decision called for a base ROE of 10.9% and a cap of 12.19%. Our currently allowed ROE is 10.57%, and our current cap is 11.74%. So if the FERC would adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would find ourselves under-reserved for the earlier refund period by $34 million after tax and over-reserved for the later refund period by $8 million after tax. 
Because we cannot be certain how FERC commissioners will ultimately decide the case, we didn't book any charges this quarter due to the ALJ recommendation. We will reexamine the issue as this process moves forward. If FERC were to adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would have a onetime net charge of approximately $0.08 per share. Going forward, however, we would earn a higher ROE of 10.9% compared with the current base of 10.57%.
Parties to the case filed comments on the ALJ recommendation on April 21. We continue to expect the final FERC decision around the end of this year or early 2017. I should note that after 6 months of no additional complaints, a fourth complaint was filed this past Friday by Eastern Massachusetts Municipal Electric Companies. We await FERC action on this fourth complaint. 
Turning to financing. Eversource parent issued $500 million of senior notes in March, $250 million of 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.5% and $250 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 3.35%. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt. The issuances were several times oversubscribed, and we're very pleased with the rates we received. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Lee."
292525,331928227,976386,"Eversource Energy, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Jim. I'll provide you with a brief update in our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according t",1271,"Okay. Thank you, Jim. I'll provide you with a brief update in our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according to schedule. March was an important month from this standpoint of receiving public input on our project. A total of 7 public meetings were held around the state in the month: 3 by the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee; 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy; and 2 jointly between these 2 primary permitting agencies. The Site Evaluation Committee will hold 2 additional public meetings on some follow-up items, 1 later this month and another in June.
April 4th was the deadline for the written comments on the draft environmental impact statement, and we expect a final environmental impact statement from the DOE in the fourth quarter of this year. 
On the state side, the New Hampshire SEC recently established a near-term schedule through the end of June, providing for commencement of the discovery process in mid-May. The dates are similar to what we had proposed. Under the state statute, we would expect the New Hampshire SEC to hold evidentiary hearings and issue a decision before the end of the year. We're aware that some intervenors have requested a more prolonged review period, and we expect a ruling soon on those requests and establishment of a firm schedule. 
Assuming the final schedule is consistent with the statutory deadline, as you can see on Slide 9, it would support the issuance of a Presidential permit from the Department of Energy early next year and the commencement of construction shortly thereafter. We continue to see support for the project building in New Hampshire, and we were gratified by the number of favorable comments in the public meetings, particularly from the labor and business communities of New Hampshire. We believe this is a sign of growing public support for the project and the billions of dollars in benefits it will bring to New Hampshire. As stated in our February earnings call, we bid both Northern Pass and the Clean Energy Connect into the 3-state electric RFP. Clean Energy Connect would allow 600 megawatts of carbon-free energy to flow from New York into New England. The review process for our projects and the other approximately 20 that would bid into the process continues, and we expect the states involved in the RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, to announce the winning bids this summer. 
I will now turn to Slide 10 and the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts, to bring firm natural gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. The project is designed to provide 900 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the 2013 and '14 period.
Access Northeast builds out the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will soon grow as nearly 2,600 megawatts of new proposed plants are built and connected to the project.
Access Northeast allows direct last-mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business model is that electric utilities sign long-term contracts with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators or the market price. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently without fuel to run their units during cold winter weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. If a large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the fuel supply needs of natural gas generators, we can depend less on more costly and higher-emitting coal and oil plants that typically operate when the region's natural gas supplies are short. We continue to make significant progress on securing and seeking approval of contracts with New England electric distribution companies. The current status of the state reviews is on Slide 11.
You'll recall that following an RFP this past fall NSTAR Electric, Western Mass Electric and 2 national grid electric distribution companies filed with the Massachusetts DPU seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. Our 2 utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. The DPU has established a schedule to review that filing that would support a decision in the early fall.
Evidentiary hearings on all of the contracts are scheduled for this summer. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for more than 40% of Access Northeast targeted capacity. 
In Connecticut, we expect the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a request for proposals for natural gas capacity shortly. We expect this process to be complete with approved contracts late this year or early in 2017.
In New Hampshire, you may recall that the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19 in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the Public Utility Commission had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts were shown to be in customers' interests. 
On February 18, the Public Service of New Hampshire filed with state regulators a natural gas contract with Access Northeast that was similar to what the 4 Massachusetts electric utilities filed in their state. If the New Hampshire public utility commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest. A technical session on the docket schedule was held yesterday. We are optimistic that the commissioners will agree with the staff that they have authority to approve a contract with Public Service of New Hampshire and Access Northeast. The PUC's consideration of whether the contracts provide benefits to customers would follow its legal ruling on the issues.
In Maine, where regulators have been engaged in natural gas contracting issue for some time, state regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by the early fall.
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in the fall, with bids received November 13, around the same time as the Massachusetts electric distribution companies had their RFP. We expect the National Grid to make a decision and file with Rhode Island regulators by early this summer. 
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation is yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be sufficiently advanced by the end of this year so that we can promptly file our formal application with FERC and bring additional natural gas supplies into New England for the winter of 2018 to 2019.
We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy challenges. 
And now, I'd like to return the call back over to Jeff for any Q&As."

And as we have future rate cases, we'll be decoupled everywhere, I expect. But we are forecasting flat on the electric side. But because of the gas conversions going on, we think there'll be 2% to 3% growth in gas sales annually. And really, I think the primary driver to that flat growth is -- got nothing to do with the economy. In particular in the Boston area, the economy is booming; there's lots of construction going on. But we as a company spend $500 million a year, $0.5 billion a year, on energy efficiency. And I think that has a significant impact, 2% impact, on the sales results for the company. Now fortunately, the rate-making mechanism for energy efficiency spending makes us whole, either decoupling or loss-based revenues reimburse us. If we actually do a good job on the projects, we're able to earn an incentive. And at the same time, we're recovering our cost as we incur them each year. So the cash flow is positive as well. So were it not for energy efficiency, I think we'd be looking at 2% or higher sales volume growth."

Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $2",1261,"Thanks, Phil. Today I will cover first quarter financial results, our strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. 
Starting with our financial results in Slide 4. We rendered $244 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $253 million or $0.80 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Both of the -- those are GAAP numbers since we are no longer separating out merger integration costs in reporting our results. These results represent a solid start to 2016 despite the very mild weather in the first quarter. These results also support our full year EPS estimate of $2.90 to $3.05 per share as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Our transmission segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $0.21 per share in the first quarter last year. The first of 2 principal drivers of that increase was the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 after FERC issued its final decision in the First New England transmission ROE complaint. The second factor was the earnings growth we are experiencing as a result of our continued investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. That rate-based growth added $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2016. 
On the Electric Distribution side, we earned $0.34 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2015. 3 principal factors contributed to this $0.07 per share reduction in earnings. The primary driver was the absence in 2016 of about $0.09 of benefits we realized in the first quarter last year from settling several long-standing dockets at NSTAR Electric. Milder weather in the first quarter of 2016 reduced earnings at NSTAR Electric and PSNH where distribution revenues are not fully decoupled, and that cost us about $0.02 per share.
Partially offsetting those impacts were lower O&M and other items, including our second quarter 2015 accumulated deferred income tax settlement at Connecticut Light & Power. Altogether, those factors added about $0.04 per share in the first quarter.
On the Natural Gas Distribution side, we earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Warmer weather was the principal factor, with lower gas revenues costing us $0.05 per share despite a nearly $16 million annualized rate increase at NSTAR Gas.
We had a very cold first quarter in 2015 and a very mild first quarter in 2016. Heating degree days in the Boston area were 21% above normal in the first quarter of 2015, when NSTAR Gas did not yet have decoupling. In Connecticut, where Yankee Gas is not yet decoupled, heating degree days were about 10% below normal in the first quarter this year compared with 18% above normal in the first quarter of 2015. The weather impact was partially offset by lower O&M, a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and other factors that together added $0.03 per share to earnings. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $140 million in the first quarter of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of $911 million for the full year. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major reliability transmission projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. We have now invested more than $130 million in those projects, with many elements now completed, under construction or before regulators for approval. By 2019, we expect to invest $900 million in these comprehensive solutions to our regions' energy -- long-term reliability challenges.
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has a number of projects before it, including Northern Pass. Last month we filed application with the Site Evaluation Committee to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability Project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect a decision on our application by mid-2017 and to complete the Seacoast project by the end of 2018.
We also continued to expand our natural gas delivery system in the first quarter. We've added about 2,500 natural gas heating customers in the first quarter, up about 20% from the 2,050 we added in the first quarter of 2015 and very consistent with our full year 2016 goal of 12,500 new heating customers.
We added a 72nd town to the Yankee Gas Service territory, the town of Bozrah in Eastern Connecticut. And despite the mild winter, we did have 1 frigid weekend around Presidents' Day when both Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas set all-time records for the amount of natural gas delivered in a single day. On February 14, NSTAR Gas delivered over 8.5% more natural gas to our customers than the previous record set back in January 2014. 
Now I will turn to our regulatory calendar in Slide 6. We are awaiting a decision from the New Hampshire PUC on a comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, PSNH generating rate base, including undepreciated plants, fuel and inventory, totals approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process will be recovered through securitization. We continue to expect the entire sale and securitization process to be completed by this time next year. 
Moving from New Hampshire to Washington. On March 22, the administrative law judge at FERC handling complaints #2 and complaint #3 involving the ROEs earned by all New England Transmission Owners issued his initial recommendation. For the 15-month refund period ended in March 2014, the 400-page recommendation called for a base ROE of 9.59% and a cap of 10.42%. For the 15-month period ending October 2015, the decision called for a base ROE of 10.9% and a cap of 12.19%. Our currently allowed ROE is 10.57%, and our current cap is 11.74%. So if the FERC would adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would find ourselves under-reserved for the earlier refund period by $34 million after tax and over-reserved for the later refund period by $8 million after tax. 
Because we cannot be certain how FERC commissioners will ultimately decide the case, we didn't book any charges this quarter due to the ALJ recommendation. We will reexamine the issue as this process moves forward. If FERC were to adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would have a onetime net charge of approximately $0.08 per share. Going forward, however, we would earn a higher ROE of 10.9% compared with the current base of 10.57%.
Parties to the case filed comments on the ALJ recommendation on April 21. We continue to expect the final FERC decision around the end of this year or early 2017. I should note that after 6 months of no additional complaints, a fourth complaint was filed this past Friday by Eastern Massachusetts Municipal Electric Companies. We await FERC action on this fourth complaint. 
Turning to financing. Eversource parent issued $500 million of senior notes in March, $250 million of 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.5% and $250 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 3.35%. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt. The issuances were several times oversubscribed, and we're very pleased with the rates we received. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update in our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide 8. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according to schedule. March was an important month from this standpoint of receiving public input on our project. A total of 7 public meetings were held around the state in the month: 3 by the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee; 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy; and 2 jointly between these 2 primary permitting agencies. The Site Evaluation Committee will hold 2 additional public meetings on some follow-up items, 1 later this month and another in June.
April 4th was the deadline for the written comments on the draft environmental impact statement, and we expect a final environmental impact statement from the DOE in the fourth quarter of this year. 
On the state side, the New Hampshire SEC recently established a near-term schedule through the end of June, providing for commencement of the discovery process in mid-May. The dates are similar to what we had proposed. Under the state statute, we would expect the New Hampshire SEC to hold evidentiary hearings and issue a decision before the end of the year. We're aware that some intervenors have requested a more prolonged review period, and we expect a ruling soon on those requests and establishment of a firm schedule. 
Assuming the final schedule is consistent with the statutory deadline, as you can see on Slide 9, it would support the issuance of a Presidential permit from the Department of Energy early next year and the commencement of construction shortly thereafter. We continue to see support for the project building in New Hampshire, and we were gratified by the number of favorable comments in the public meetings, particularly from the labor and business communities of New Hampshire. We believe this is a sign of growing public support for the project and the billions of dollars in benefits it will bring to New Hampshire. As stated in our February earnings call, we bid both Northern Pass and the Clean Energy Connect into the 3-state electric RFP. Clean Energy Connect would allow 600 megawatts of carbon-free energy to flow from New York into New England. The review process for our projects and the other approximately 20 that would bid into the process continues, and we expect the states involved in the RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, to announce the winning bids this summer. 
I will now turn to Slide 10 and the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts, to bring firm natural gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. The project is designed to provide 900 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the 2013 and '14 period.
Access Northeast builds out the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will soon grow as nearly 2,600 megawatts of new proposed plants are built and connected to the project.
Access Northeast allows direct last-mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business model is that electric utilities sign long-term contracts with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators or the market price. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently without fuel to run their units during cold winter weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. If a large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the fuel supply needs of natural gas generators, we can depend less on more costly and higher-emitting coal and oil plants that typically operate when the region's natural gas supplies are short. We continue to make significant progress on securing and seeking approval of contracts with New England electric distribution companies. The current status of the state reviews is on Slide 11.
You'll recall that following an RFP this past fall NSTAR Electric, Western Mass Electric and 2 national grid electric distribution companies filed with the Massachusetts DPU seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. Our 2 utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. The DPU has established a schedule to review that filing that would support a decision in the early fall.
Evidentiary hearings on all of the contracts are scheduled for this summer. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for more than 40% of Access Northeast targeted capacity. 
In Connecticut, we expect the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a request for proposals for natural gas capacity shortly. We expect this process to be complete with approved contracts late this year or early in 2017.
In New Hampshire, you may recall that the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19 in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the Public Utility Commission had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts were shown to be in customers' interests. 
On February 18, the Public Service of New Hampshire filed with state regulators a natural gas contract with Access Northeast that was similar to what the 4 Massachusetts electric utilities filed in their state. If the New Hampshire public utility commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest. A technical session on the docket schedule was held yesterday. We are optimistic that the commissioners will agree with the staff that they have authority to approve a contract with Public Service of New Hampshire and Access Northeast. The PUC's consideration of whether the contracts provide benefits to customers would follow its legal ruling on the issues.
In Maine, where regulators have been engaged in natural gas contracting issue for some time, state regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by the early fall.
In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in the fall, with bids received November 13, around the same time as the Massachusetts electric distribution companies had their RFP. We expect the National Grid to make a decision and file with Rhode Island regulators by early this summer. 
In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation is yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be sufficiently advanced by the end of this year so that we can promptly file our formal application with FERC and bring additional natural gas supplies into New England for the winter of 2018 to 2019.
We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy challenges. 
And now, I'd like to return the call back over to Jeff for any Q&As."

And as we have future rate cases, we'll be decoupled everywhere, I expect. But we are forecasting flat on the electric side. But because of the gas conversions going on, we think there'll be 2% to 3% growth in gas sales annually. And really, I think the primary driver to that flat growth is -- got nothing to do with the economy. In particular in the Boston area, the economy is booming; there's lots of construction going on. But we as a company spend $500 million a year, $0.5 billion a year, on energy efficiency. And I think that has a significant impact, 2% impact, on the sales results for the company. Now fortunately, the rate-making mechanism for energy efficiency spending makes us whole, either decoupling or loss-based revenues reimburse us. If we actually do a good job on the projects, we're able to earn an incentive. And at the same time, we're recovering our cost as we incur them each year. So the cash flow is positive as well. So were it not for energy efficiency, I think we'd be looking at 2% or higher sales volume growth."

Today I'll cover our second quarter and first half financial results, recent legislative and regulatory developments in our 3 states, an update on certain transmission projects and a review o",1684,"Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today I'll cover our second quarter and first half financial results, recent legislative and regulatory developments in our 3 states, an update on certain transmission projects and a review of recent financing and rating agency activity. 
So let's start with the quarter and that's on Slide 4. We earned $203.6 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $207.5 million or $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our transmission segment earned $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factor driving the earnings growth was higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued investment in the reliability of New England power grid. I'll summarize some of the key reliability driven transmission projects in a moment. 
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.38 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factors driving this decrease were: High depreciation and property taxes; higher interest expense; and the absence this year of a regulatory true-up that CL&P recorded at the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the final Connecticut pure regulatory decision involving deferred taxes. Additionally, O&M was somewhat higher during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of last year, but that was primarily due to timing issues attributable to last year's weather impacts. 
On the natural gas side, we earned 6 [ph] -- $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were higher revenues that resulted from the NSTAR Gas rate increase that took effect January 1 of 2016; and cooler early spring weather in 2016 compared with 2015, which increased sales. 
Turning from the second quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $447.8 [ph] million or $1.41 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $460.8 million or $1.45 per share in the first half of 2015. Transmission earnings totaled $0.56 per share compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the first half of 2015. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to the FERC commission decision on the first complaint against the returns on equity earned by New England Transmission Owners. 
Our electric distribution and generation segment earned $0.66 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.80 per share in the first half of 2015. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution systems reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Our natural gas distribution segment earned $0.19 per share in the first half of 2016, unchanged from the first half of 2015. The mild first quarter weather which significantly reduced natural gas sales was essentially offset by a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth. We added nearly 4,700 space heating customers in the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to target 12,500 new heating customers this year. And conversion activity generally picks up in September and we expect to see the same trend this year. 
O&M continues to be a very good story this year. Our employees continued to provide excellent reliability for our customers while at the same time reducing costs. We are very proud of our service reliability here at Eversource. In 2015, we had the best reliability in the company's history and performed in the top quartile of the industry. That same high reliability continues in 2016. 
Turning back to O&M, you may recall that last year, our first quarter O&M was $0.05 per share lower due to the resolution of a bad debt dispute we had in Massachusetts. If we exclude that impact, lower O&M has added $0.04 per share to midyear results in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. And we expect lower O&M to continue to benefit the results in second half of the year. 
In June, we moved away from 2 legacy payroll and benefit systems into one common platform. This is the latest in the number of systems conversion and process improvements that we've completed to make ourselves more efficient and better able to provide great service to our 3.6 million customers. 
With a good 6 months behind us, we feel very good about where we are this year. We've affirmed our full year guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 as well as our long-term earnings-per-share growth in the 5% to 7% range. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $360 million in the first half of 2016 and we continue to target transmission and capital investments of about $910 million for the full year. As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: The Greater Boston Reliability Solution; and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut solution. In the second quarter, we received Connecticut Siting Council approval for a new $50 million transmission line, west of Hartford and a series of improvement in Bloomfield area of north of Hartford. Both of these projects are part of the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut project and construction is expected to begin next quarter. To date, we've invested $80 million in Greater Hartford projects and continue to expect invest $350 million by the time they are completed in late 2018. 
On Greater Boston, you may have seen the news release earlier this month concerning the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee's approval of the Merrimack Value Reliability projects, which we and National Grid are building in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Our share of that project is $37 million, and we expect to begin construction this fall. I should also note that the estimated total cost for the Greater Boston Sweeter projects has increased modestly from $544 million to $565 million. And we continue to expect completing them by the end of 2019. We've invested approximately $78 million on these projects to date. 
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has another large project before it in addition to Northern Pass and Merrimack Valley. In June, the committee accepted as complete our application to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect the Site Evaluation Committee decision on this application by mid-2017 and to complete the seacoast project by the end of 2018. We have invested nearly $10 million in this project to date. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6 and recent developments involving legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In April, Massachusetts amended its laws to encourage continued expansion of solar generation in the state. In addition to raising solar net metering caps, the new law allows Massachusetts Electric Utilities to file with the DPU to construct up to 35 megawatts of solar generation. On June 30, NSTAR Electric filed an application with the Department of Public Utilities to build 35 megawatts of solar generation facilities. And Western Mass Electric company, which already has 8 megawatts of solar generation, applied to develop an additional 27 megawatts of solar generation. Together, we would expect to invest approximately $200 million in these new facilities. 
The statute requires the DPU to issue a decision on our applications by the year-end 2016 and for us to complete construction by the end of 2017. We would expect a return that is consistent with our allowed distribution ROEs. These expenditures are incremental to the capital investment plan that we presented in February. 
Also in Massachusetts, there's new legislation before the Senate and the House that would help the state move its clean energy goals. The House and Senate have approved different versions of the legislation over the last several weeks, and now have a conference committee working to iron out a compromised version. Both versions call for contracting significant quantities of clean power from facilities such as offshore wind and other sources such as hydroelectric plants. The current session ends on Sunday. So by Monday, we should know the final outcome of this bill. 
Turning from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. On July 1, the New Hampshire PUC approved our comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, public service in New Hampshire's generating rate base included undepreciated plan, fuel and inventory totals of approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process would be recovered through securitization. 
The next step of this process is for the New Hampshire PUC to select an auction advisor to assist in the sale of the plants. We expect that selection to be finalized during the first half of September and we anticipate that the entire sale securitization process will be completed in the second half of 2017. 
Continuing into financing, NSTAR Electric issued $250 million of 10-year unsecured debentures in May. Proceeds were primarily used to refinance $200 million maturing debt. Also in June, Western Mass Electric closed on the sale of $50 million of 10-year unsecured notes. 
Turning to Slide 7. We've also had some positive news about our credit ratings and outlooks. Moody's upgraded both public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass, and Fitch upgraded CL&P as well as public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass. Electric. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's moved all of our outlooks to positive. These outlooks are a great testament to the company's strong financial position. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn back the call to Jeff for Q&A. 
Lets start with Northern Pass on Slide 9. There have been a number of developments involving NTT since our most recent earnings call in early May. On June 23 the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee or SEC approved a detailed schedule for its review of Northern Pass. Among the key dates the schedule calls for testimony by November 15, supplemental testimony by March 15, 2017 and a final prehearing conference by the end of March 2017. This schedule supports a final decision no later than September 2017. We are very encouraged by a series of other developments that have occurred with Northern Pass since our last earnings call. Developments that underscore the benefits that the project will bring to New Hampshire in the coming decades. 
First, public service PSNH last month filed with the PUC a 20-year purchase agreement with a hydro affiliate that will guarantee its customers up to 100 megawatts of favorably priced clean E&P power.
[Audio Gap]
Will provide $20 [ph] million or $2 million and year for 10 years for programs or initiatives approved by the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission that advance energy efficiency, clean energy innovation, community betterment and economic development in New Hampshire. 
Fourth, in June, our partner Hydro Quebec received approval for its portion of the project on the Canadian side from Quebec's Energy board, while a couple of additional approvals are necessary to the Board, one from the province and another from Canada's National Energy Board, this progress is consistent with our timetable for the United States version of the project. 
Fifth and most recently, on July 19, [indiscernible] on New England issued its I-39 approval in Northern Pass, finding that the project has now proposed will not have a significant adverse affect on the liability of the regions grid. If the New Hampshire SEC issues a written order approving the 192 New Hampshire section in September 2017, we would be in a position to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval that fall and commence construction by the end of 2017. Based upon that schedule, we should be in a position to complete the project in 2018 and '19. And as you can see on Slide 10, bring it into service by the end of 2019. 
The Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on Slide 11. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England. That percentage will grow as plants that have cleared the New England capacity process add nearly another 2,600 megawatts of natural gas generation that would be connected to the project. Access Northeast allows firm deliveries directly to power plants to ensure that they can operate when they are needed most. 
Turning to Slide 12. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England in the winter months, the lack of access to natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. Slide 12 looks at New England and Miso power crisis in the summer of 2015 and compares them to the winter of 2014, '15. You can see that in the summer, our wholesale electricity prices are actually a bit lower than MISO's, but during the cold winter, they can be 3x higher than MISOs. Access Northeast will address that challenge by providing 900 million cubic feet a day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient, low-cost industries to remain online and when winter temperatures drop. Improved reliability, fuel supply will save New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the winter of 2013 and '14 period. 
On Slide 13, you can see how our regions fuel mix shifts from natural gas to oil and coal when temperatures fall. December 2014 was a long month and has resulted very little coal or oil was burnt. January and February of 2015 were quite cold, so less natural gas was available to generators and much more coal and oil were burnt. This has not only increase the region's prices, increased the region's greenhouse gas emissions, which all New England states are committed to reduce significantly over the next few decades. 
Slide 14 illustrates the beneficial environmental impact Access Northeast can have on our region. By burning natural gas in new efficient plants rather than coal and oil in much older, high heat rig plants, we can avoid the emissions of 3.4 million tons of CO2 each winter, which is the equivalent of taking about 650,000 tires off the road each year. 
As you can see on Slide 15 providing adequate year-round natural gas supplies is also critical to increasing the region's use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. The slide illustrates how much we expect renewable sources to grow in New England. Natural gas generation, much more so than older nuclear and coal and oil units can provide, have rapid response to changing the demand and weather conditions. This is critical to operating a reliable grid. On the siding level, we continue to move through the FERC pre-application process and expect to be in a position to make our formal application in the fourth quarter of this year. On the state regulatory level, we have a number of developments over the past few months. As you can see on Slide 16. In May, the public utility commission voted on July 19 to endorse a contract with Access Northeast, assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. We view this as a positive development for the project because the state commission concluded, after a lengthy independent review, that customers would benefit from Access Northeast. Further, the commission approved the business model of the electric utilities entering into a pipeline capacity contract. 
In Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities will commence hearing next week on a 20-year natural gas capacity contract that Access Northeast has signed with Eversource and National Grid Electric Utilities in Massachusetts. Hearings are due to conclude in mid-August and we are -- we expect for approvals this fall. You may recall that the DPU rule that it had authority under existing states [indiscernible] to approve such contracts. The couple of project opponents appeal to defuse order through the state supreme judicial Court, claiming the commission lacks such authority. That case is pending and we expect a decision later this summer. 
In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, issued an RFP for natural gas capacity at the beginning of June with bids due on June 29. The department received 7 bids, which it is now evaluating and is expected to announce the winner or winners by the end of August with filings on pure by the end of October. Once contracts have filed, Pure has up to 90 days to [indiscernible]. 
In New Hampshire, the Public Utility Commission is now evaluating the gas supply contract with Access Northeast and public service of New Hampshire, which was filed earlier this year. The PUC's review is in 2 parts. The first is to determine whether the PU staff was correct last year when they determined that the commission has the authority to approve such contracts. The second part requires the commission determine to whether the contract is in the customer's best interest. We are now awaiting a ruling on the first phase of that docket. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast capacity on June 30. A decision is due before the end of October of this year. The bottom line is that Access Northeast continues to make significant progress on multiple fronts. I don't have to remind you what is at stake here in New England, breaking point with more than 1,500 megawatts of generation that can burn coal or oil will shut down in 2 months. The [indiscernible] Nuclear Power facility with nearly 700 megawatts will retire in 2 years. The issue in New England is not only the additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion that customers pay to winter further power, it's even with high prices, we have enough fuel during the coldest winter evenings to keep the customer's lights on. We expect to begin construction of Access Northeast by mid-2018. We had said before certain elements of the pipeline should enter into service in 2018, with additional pipeline segments and 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage entering service in subsequent years. 
So now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A."

We feel very confident in that project. It's a great deal. There won't be another deal like that because the way that it's bid essentially customers would pay a little -- approximately 60% of the cost of the project. The project saves billions of dollars, it reduces 3 million to 4 million tons of carbon a year. Massachusetts has very aggressive goals in reduction at least material litigation with the Conservation Law Foundation with Massachusetts, DPU, that now requires that the state put together goals and objectives that demonstrate reductions of carbon. That's the biggest -- if you want lower carbon reduction, you bring on Canadian hydropower. Again, that's probably the best deal and there probably won't be another one like it, where you have Hydro-Québec willing to pay $600 million of their own transmission on their side. So I have very high confidence in both of those projects. They're complex. They've taken lots and lots of twists and turns, but we believe both of them are moving in the right direction."

So clearly, anyone who has watched the window knows there's not enough gas and that hinders the marketplace and forces a lot of plants offline that would either wise run should they be gas. Our development of a pipeline in having one [ph] turn capacity contracts with PCs, we believe, would stimulate the competitive marketplace. And it's really designed to do to have the older, more inefficient, more higher commission plants retire and have new plants come on through the fuller capacity market process. So if you -- if for some reason that we don't expect that FERC rules adversely against the project as generators in this particular case [indiscernible], the project is still viable.

Today I'll cover our second quarter and first half financial results, recent legislative and regulatory developments in our 3 states, an update on certain transmission projects and a review of recent financing and rating agency activity. 
So let's start with the quarter and that's on Slide 4. We earned $203.6 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $207.5 million or $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our transmission segment earned $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factor driving the earnings growth was higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued investment in the reliability of New England power grid. I'll summarize some of the key reliability driven transmission projects in a moment. 
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.38 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factors driving this decrease were: High depreciation and property taxes; higher interest expense; and the absence this year of a regulatory true-up that CL&P recorded in the second quarter of 2015, as a result of the final Connecticut pure regulatory decision involving deferred taxes. Additionally, O&M was somewhat higher during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of last year, but that was primarily due to timing issues attributable to last year's weather impacts. 
On the natural gas side, we earned $0.06 -- $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were higher revenues that resulted from the NSTAR Gas rate increase that took effect January 1 of 2016; and cooler early spring weather in 2016 compared with 2015, which increased sales. 
Turning from the second quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $447.8 million or $1.41 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $460.8 million or $1.45 per share in the first half of 2015. Transmission earnings totaled $0.56 per share compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the first half of 2015. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to the FERC commission decision on the first complaint against the returns on equity earned by New England Transmission Owners. 
Our electric distribution and generation segment earned $0.66 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.80 per share in the first half of 2015. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution systems reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Our natural gas distribution segment earned $0.19 per share in the first half of 2016, unchanged from the first half of 2015. The mild first quarter weather which significantly reduced natural gas sales was essentially offset by a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth. We added nearly 4,700 space heating customers in the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to target 12,500 new heating customers this year. And conversion activity generally picks up in September and we expect to see the same trend this year. 
O&M continues to be a very good story this year. Our employees continued to provide excellent reliability for our customers while at the same time reducing costs. We are very proud of our service reliability here at Eversource. In 2015, we had the best reliability in the company's history and performed in the top quartile of the industry. That same high reliability continues in 2016. 
Turning back to O&M, you may recall that last year, our first quarter O&M was $0.05 per share lower due to the resolution of a bad debt dispute we had in Massachusetts. If we exclude that impact, lower O&M has added $0.04 per share to midyear results in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. And we expect lower O&M to continue to benefit the results in the second half of the year. 
In June, we moved away from 2 legacy payroll and benefit systems into one common platform. This is the latest in the number of systems conversions and process improvements that we've completed to make ourselves more efficient and better able to provide great service to our 3.6 million customers. 
With a good 6 months behind us, we feel very good about where we are this year. We've affirmed our full year guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 as well as our long-term earnings-per-share growth in the 5% to 7% range. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $360 million in the first half of 2016, and we continue to target transmission and capital investments of about $910 million for the full year. As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: The Greater Boston Reliability Solution and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut solution. In the second quarter, we received Connecticut Siting Council approval for a new $50 million transmission line, west of Hartford and a series of improvement in the Bloomfield winter area of north of Hartford. Both of these projects are part of the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut project and construction is expected to begin next quarter. To date, we've invested $80 million in Greater Hartford projects and continue to expect to invest $350 million by the time they are completed in late 2018. 
On Greater Boston, you may have seen the news release earlier this month concerning the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee's approval of the Merrimack Value Reliability projects, which we and National Grid are building in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Our share of that project is $37 million, and we expect to begin construction this fall. I should also note that the estimated total cost for the Greater Boston suite of projects has increased modestly from $544 million to $565 million. And we continue to expect completing them by the end of 2019. We've invested approximately $78 million on these projects to date. 
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has another large project before it in addition to Northern Pass and Merrimack Valley. In June, the committee accepted as complete our application to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect the Site Evaluation Committee decision on this application by mid-2017 and to complete the seacoast project by the end of 2018. We have invested nearly $10 million in this project to date. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6 and recent developments involving legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In April, Massachusetts amended its laws to encourage continued expansion of solar generation in the state. In addition to raising solar net metering caps, the new law allows Massachusetts Electric Utilities to file with the DPU to construct up to 35 megawatts of solar generation. On June 30, NSTAR Electric filed an application with the Department of Public Utilities to build 35 megawatts of solar generation facilities. And Western Mass Electric company, which already has 8 megawatts of solar generation, applied to develop an additional 27 megawatts of solar generation. Together, we would expect to invest approximately $200 million in these new facilities. 
The statute requires the DPU to issue a decision on our applications by the year-end 2016 and for us to complete construction by the end of 2017. We would expect a return that is consistent with our allowed distribution ROEs. These expenditures are incremental to the capital investment plan that we presented in February. 
Also in Massachusetts, there's new legislation before the Senate and the House that would help the state move its clean energy goals. The House and Senate have approved different versions of the legislation over the last several weeks, and now have a conference committee working to iron out a compromised version. Both versions call for contracting a significant quantities of clean power from facilities such as offshore wind and other sources such as hydroelectric plants. The current session ends on Sunday. So by Monday, we should know the final outcome of this bill. 
Turning from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. On July 1, the New Hampshire PUC approved our comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, public service in New Hampshire's generating rate base included undepreciated plan, fuel and inventory totals of approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process would be recovered through securitization. 
The next step of this process is for the New Hampshire PUC to select an auction adviser to assist in the sale of the plants. We expect that selection to be finalized during the first half of September, and we anticipate that the entire sale securitization process will be completed in the second half of 2017. 
Continuing into financing, NSTAR Electric issued $250 million of 10-year unsecured debentures in May. Proceeds were primarily used to refinance $200 million maturing debt. Also in June, Western Mass Electric closed on the sale of $50 million of 10-year unsecured notes. 
Turning to Slide 7. We've also had some positive news about our credit ratings and outlooks. Moody's upgraded both public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass, and Fitch upgraded CL&P as well as public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass Electric. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's moved all of our outlooks to positive. These outlooks are a great testament to the company's strong financial position. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Lets start with Northern Pass on Slide 9. There have been a number of developments involving NPT since our most recent earnings call in early May. On June 23, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee or SEC approved a detailed schedule for its review of Northern Pass. Among the key dates, the schedule calls for intervenor testimony by November 15, supplemental testimony by March 15, 2017, and a final prehearing conference by the end of March 2017. This schedule supports a final decision no later than September 2017. We are very encouraged by a series of other developments that have occurred with Northern Pass since our last earnings call. Developments that underscore the benefits that the project will bring to New Hampshire in the coming decades. 
First, public service PSNH last month filed with the PUC a 20-year power purchase agreement with a Hydro-Quebec affiliate that will guarantee its customers with up to 100 megawatts of favorably priced clean on-peak power. 
Second, in May, a litigation brought by certain project opponents when the Hampshire superior court rented a summary judgment in favor of Northern Pass. The court determined the the state department of transportation not project opponents had exclusive authority to allow the project to be varied in the public right away in a small section of state highway in Northern Hampshire. Those project opponents have appealed that decision to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, but the lower court 's reasoning was well supported by the facts and decades of New Hampshire law. And we fully expect the decision will be upheld. 
Third, we reached the settlement agreement with New Hampshire public utility commission staff that if approved by the commission, we'll affirm that the designation of Northern Pass transmission as a state utility a required step in the overall project approval process. That designation is predicated on finding up public good and will allow Northern Pass to operate transmission facilities in the State at New Hampshire. As part of the agreement, Northern Pass committed that the Forward New Hampshire plan 
will provide $20 million or $2 million a year for 10 years for programs or initiatives approved by the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission that advance energy efficiency, clean energy innovation, community betterment and economic development in New Hampshire. 
Fourth, in June, our partner Hydro-Quebec received approval for its portion of the project on the Canadian side from Quebec's Energy board, while a couple of additional approvals are necessary north of the border, one from the province and another from Canada's National Energy Board, this progress is consistent with our timetable for the United States portion of the project. 
Fifth and most recently, on July 19, ISO-New England issued its I-39 approval in Northern Pass, finding that the project has now proposed will not have a significant adverse affect on the liability of the regions grid. If the New Hampshire SEC issues a written order approving the 192 mile New Hampshire section in September 2017, we would be in a position to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval that fall and commence construction by the end of 2017. Based upon that schedule, we should be in a position to complete the project in 2018 and '19. And as you can see on Slide 10, bring it into service by the end of 2019. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn the Access Northeast on Slide 11. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England. That percentage will grow as plants that have cleared the New England capacity process add nearly another 2,600 megawatts of natural gas generation that would be connected to the project. Access Northeast allows firm deliveries directly to power plants to ensure that they can operate when they are needed most. 
Turning to Slide 12. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England in the winter months, the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. 
Slide 12 looks at New England and MISO power crisis in the summer of 2015 and compares them to the winter of 2014, '15. You can see that in the summer, our wholesale electricity prices are actually a bit lower than MISOs, but during the cold winter, they can be 3x higher than MISOs. Access Northeast will address that challenge by providing 900 million cubic feet a day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient, low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop. Improved reliability, fuel supply will save New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the winter of 2013 and '14 period. 
On Slide 13, you can see how our regions fuel mix shifts from natural gas to oil and coal when temperatures fall. December 2014 was a long month and as a result very little coal or oil was burnt. January and February of 2015 were quite cold, so less natural gas was available to generators and much more coal and oil were burnt. This has not only increased the region's prices, increased the region's greenhouse gas emissions, which all New England states are committed to reduce significantly over the course of the next 3 decades. 
Slide 14 illustrates the beneficial environmental impact Access Northeast can have on our region. By burning natural gas in new efficient plants rather than coal and oil in much older high heat rig plants, we can avoid the emissions of 3.4 million tons of CO2 each winter, which is equivalent taking about 650,000 cars off the road each year. 
As you can see on Slide 15 providing adequate year-round natural gas supplies is also critical to increasing the region's use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. The slide illustrates how much we expect renewable sources to grow in New England. Natural gas generation, much more so than older nuclear and coal and oil units can provide a rapid response to changing grid demand and weather conditions. This is critical to operating a reliable grid. On the siding level, we continue to move through the FERC pre-application process and expect to be in a position to make our formal application in the fourth quarter of this year. On the state regulatory level, we have a number of developments over the past few months. As you can see on Slide 16. In May, the public utility commission voted on July 19 to endorse a contract with Access Northeast, assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. We view this as a positive development for the project because the state commission concluded, after a lengthy independent review, that customers would benefit from Access Northeast. Further, the commission approved the business model of the electric utilities entering into a pipeline capacity contract. 
In Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities will commence hearings next week on a 20-year natural gas capacity contracts that Access Northeast has signed with Eversource and National Grid Electric Utilities in Massachusetts. Hearings are due to conclude in mid-August and we are -- we expect for approvals this fall. You may recall that the DPU ruled that it had authority under existing state statute to approve such contracts. A couple of project opponents appeal to defuse order to the state's Supreme Judicial Court, claiming the commission lacks such authority. That case is pending and we expect a decision later of this summer. 
In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, issued an RFP for natural gas capacity at the beginning of June with bids due on June 29. The department received 7 bids, which it is now evaluating and is expected to announce the winner or winners by the end of August with filings on PURA by the end of October. Once contracts have filed, PURA has up to 90 days to rule on them.
In New Hampshire, the Public Utility Commission is now evaluating the gas supply contract with Access Northeast and public service of New Hampshire, which was filed earlier this year. The PUC's review is in 2 parts. The first is to determine whether the PU staff was correct last year when they determined that the commission has the authority to approve such contracts. The second part requires the commission determine to whether the contract is in the customer's best interest. We are now awaiting a ruling on the first phase of that docket. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast capacity on June 30. A decision is due before the end of October of this year. The bottom line is that Access Northeast continues to make significant progress on multiple fronts. I don't have to remind you what is at stake here in New England, breaking point with more than 1,500 megawatts of generation that can burn coal or oil will shut down in 2 months. The Pilgrim nuclear power facility with nearly 700 megawatts will retire in 2 years. The issue in New England is not only the additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion that customers pay to interpret the power. It's where even with high prices, we have enough fuel during the coldest winter evenings to keep the customers lights on. We expect to begin construction of Access Northeast by mid-2018. We had said before certain elements of the pipeline should enter into service in 2018, with additional pipeline segments and 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage entering service in subsequent years. 
So now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A."

Cost up and down fairly dramatically, 30% or 40% reduction, they predict another significant reduction. So we believe that offshore wind will be viable in the region. There are 6 tracks out there that have been leased by the Federal government through the Bureau of Offshore Energy Management. And we have to see what the final legislation says. Clearly, all of that offshore wind, which could be sizable over a long period of time will need transmission development to connect it into the grid in Southeast Massachusetts. So we think, yes, that will happen until there is a potential business opportunity there for us."

And we're very happy about where we are right now to be able to, just on an initial preliminary review, identify several projects that would be coming in, in 2017 to address that. So one is what I spoke about during my opening remarks, which is about $200 million of incremental spending on solar, and that's really in that 2017 time period to build additional capacity of solar in Massachusetts. Also identified approximately $200 million of other transmission projects, either incremental projects possibly a move of some projects, but essentially incremental projects to fill in 2017. Also in looking at our gas reliability and expansion programs, there's a $25 million to $50 million incremental spend there. So very happy where we are. We're still working through our operating plans for 2017, but moving these projects into 2017 is a very positive for us at this stage."

We'll not be able to go forward and bring on scale or bring online the large-scale renewable projects, whether it's offshore wind, onshore wind. We just won't be able to do that. We won't be able to manage the reliability of the grid without having that kind of fast start, quick following the capability that you get with gas-fired combined cycle or simple cycle plants. And of course, if you look at Northern Pass right now, I mean, we have cleared many, if not most, of the hurdles on Northern Pass. The opponents of the project who litigated have lost. We feel very confident in that project. It's a great deal. There will never be another deal like that, because the way that is bid essentially customers would pay a little -- approximately about 60% of the cost of the project. The project saves billions of dollars, it reduces 3 million to 4 million tons of carbon a year. If you look at Massachusetts, which has very aggressive goals in reduction, [indiscernible] litigation with Conservation Law Foundation with Massachusetts, DPU, that now requires that the state put together goals and objectives that demonstrate reductions of carbon. That's the biggest -- if you want lower carbon reduction, you bring on Canadian hydropower. Again, that's probably the best deal around and there probably never be another one like it, where you have Hydro-Québec willing to pay $600 million of their own transmission on their side. So I have very high confidence in both of those projects. They're complex. They've taken lots of twists and turns, but we believe both of them are moving in the right direction."

And I guess first of all, I would say the thesis which we have at FERC here for precedent is no different than what takes place right now for the LDC companies, where the LDC companies pay for pipeline infrastructure that's developed by a pipeline operator. And as a result, they get first preference on it and then whatever capacity, if they don't use, it goes into the marketplace. So this would work essentially the same. And so clearly, anyone that has watched the window and the one that knows that there's not enough gas and that hinders the marketplace and forces a lot of plants offline that would otherwise run should they be gas. Development of a pipeline in having long-term capacity contracts with EDCs, we believe will stimulate the competitive marketplace and do what it's really designed to do which is to have the older, more inefficient, more higher emission plants retire and have new plants come on through the fuller capacity market process. So if you -- if for some reason that we don't expect that FERC rules adversely against the project as in the science of generators, and in this particular case, or at least a [indiscernible], the project is still viable. The savings will still be large because the gas will flow into the market, whether it's through a wholesale supplier, a marketer, it will still find its way to the market.

Today I'll cover our second quarter and first half financial results, recent legislative and regulatory developments in our 3 states, an update on certain transmission projects and a review of recent financing and rating agency activity. 
So let's start with the quarter and that's on Slide 4. We earned $203.6 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $207.5 million or $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our transmission segment earned $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factor driving the earnings growth was higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued investment in the reliability of New England power grid. I'll summarize some of the key reliability driven transmission projects in a moment. 
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.38 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factors driving this decrease were: High depreciation and property taxes; higher interest expense; and the absence this year of a regulatory true-up that CL&P recorded in the second quarter of 2015, as a result of the final Connecticut pure regulatory decision involving deferred taxes. Additionally, O&M was somewhat higher during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of last year, but that was primarily due to timing issues attributable to last year's weather impacts. 
On the natural gas side, we earned $0.06 -- $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were higher revenues that resulted from the NSTAR Gas rate increase that took effect January 1 of 2016; and cooler early spring weather in 2016 compared with 2015, which increased sales. 
Turning from the second quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $447.8 million or $1.41 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $460.8 million or $1.45 per share in the first half of 2015. Transmission earnings totaled $0.56 per share compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the first half of 2015. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to the FERC commission decision on the first complaint against the returns on equity earned by New England Transmission Owners. 
Our electric distribution and generation segment earned $0.66 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.80 per share in the first half of 2015. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution systems reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Our natural gas distribution segment earned $0.19 per share in the first half of 2016, unchanged from the first half of 2015. The mild first quarter weather which significantly reduced natural gas sales was essentially offset by a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth. We added nearly 4,700 space heating customers in the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to target 12,500 new heating customers this year. And conversion activity generally picks up in September and we expect to see the same trend this year. 
O&M continues to be a very good story this year. Our employees continued to provide excellent reliability for our customers while at the same time reducing costs. We are very proud of our service reliability here at Eversource. In 2015, we had the best reliability in the company's history and performed in the top quartile of the industry. That same high reliability continues in 2016. 
Turning back to O&M, you may recall that last year, our first quarter O&M was $0.05 per share lower due to the resolution of a bad debt dispute we had in Massachusetts. If we exclude that impact, lower O&M has added $0.04 per share to midyear results in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. And we expect lower O&M to continue to benefit the results in the second half of the year. 
In June, we moved away from 2 legacy payroll and benefit systems into one common platform. This is the latest in the number of systems conversions and process improvements that we've completed to make ourselves more efficient and better able to provide great service to our 3.6 million customers. 
With a good 6 months behind us, we feel very good about where we are this year. We've affirmed our full year guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 as well as our long-term earnings-per-share growth in the 5% to 7% range. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $360 million in the first half of 2016, and we continue to target transmission and capital investments of about $910 million for the full year. As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: The Greater Boston Reliability Solution and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut solution. In the second quarter, we received Connecticut Siting Council approval for a new $50 million transmission line, west of Hartford and a series of improvement in the Bloomfield winter area north of Hartford. Both of these projects are part of the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut project and construction is expected to begin next quarter. To date, we've invested $80 million in Greater Hartford projects and continue to expect to invest $350 million by the time they are completed in late 2018. 
On Greater Boston, you may have seen the news release earlier this month concerning the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee's approval of the Merrimack Value Reliability projects, which we and National Grid are building in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Our share of that project is $37 million, and we expect to begin construction this fall. I should also note that the estimated total cost for the Greater Boston suite of projects has increased modestly from $544 million to $565 million. And we continue to expect completing them by the end of 2019. We've invested approximately $78 million on these projects to date. 
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has another large project before it in addition to Northern Pass and Merrimack Valley. In June, the committee accepted as complete our application to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect the Site Evaluation Committee decision on this application by mid-2017 and to complete the seacoast project by the end of 2018. We have invested nearly $10 million in this project to date. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6 and recent developments involving legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In April, Massachusetts amended its laws to encourage continued expansion of solar generation in the state. In addition to raising solar net metering caps, the new law allows Massachusetts Electric Utilities to file with the DPU to construct up to 35 megawatts of solar generation. On June 30, NSTAR Electric filed an application with the Department of Public Utilities to build 35 megawatts of solar generation facilities. And Western Mass Electric company, which already has 8 megawatts of solar generation, applied to develop an additional 27 megawatts of solar generation. Together, we would expect to invest approximately $200 million in these new facilities. 
The statute requires the DPU to issue a decision on our applications by the year-end 2016 and for us to complete construction by the end of 2017. We would expect a return that is consistent with our allowed distribution ROEs. These expenditures are incremental to the capital investment plan that we presented in February. 
Also in Massachusetts, there's new legislation before the Senate and the House that would help the state move its clean energy goals. The House and Senate have approved different versions of the legislation over the last several weeks, and now have a conference committee working to iron out a compromised version. Both versions call for contracting a significant quantities of clean power from facilities such as offshore wind and other sources such as hydroelectric plants. The current session ends on Sunday. So by Monday, we should know the final outcome of this bill. 
Turning from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. On July 1, the New Hampshire PUC approved our comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, public service in New Hampshire's generating rate base included undepreciated plan, fuel and inventory totals of approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process would be recovered through securitization. 
The next step of this process is for the New Hampshire PUC to select an auction adviser to assist in the sale of the plants. We expect that selection to be finalized during the first half of September, and we anticipate that the entire sale securitization process will be completed in the second half of 2017. 
Continuing into financing, NSTAR Electric issued $250 million of 10-year unsecured debentures in May. Proceeds were primarily used to refinance $200 million maturing debt. Also in June, Western Mass Electric closed on the sale of $50 million of 10-year unsecured notes. 
Turning to Slide 7. We've also had some positive news about our credit ratings and outlooks. Moody's upgraded both public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass, and Fitch upgraded CL&P as well as public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass Electric. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's moved all of our outlooks to positive. These outlooks are a great testament to the company's strong financial position. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee."
292525,375943694,1017985,"Eversource Energy, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Phil.

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Lets start with Northern Pass on Slide 9. There have been a number of developments involving NPT since our most recent earnings call in early May. On June 23, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee or SEC approved a detailed schedule for its review of Northern Pass. Among the key dates, the schedule calls for intervenor testimony by November 15, supplemental testimony by March 15, 2017, and a final prehearing conference by the end of March 2017. This schedule supports a final decision no later than September 2017. We are very encouraged by a series of other developments that have occurred with Northern Pass since our last earnings call. Developments that underscore the benefits that the project will bring to New Hampshire in the coming decades. 
First, public service PSNH last month filed with the PUC a 20-year power purchase agreement with a Hydro-Quebec affiliate that will guarantee its customers with up to 100 megawatts of favorably priced clean on-peak power. 
Second, in May, a litigation brought by certain project opponents when the Hampshire superior court rented a summary judgment in favor of Northern Pass. The court determined the the state department of transportation not project opponents had exclusive authority to allow the project to be varied in the public right away in a small section of state highway in Northern Hampshire. Those project opponents have appealed that decision to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, but the lower court 's reasoning was well supported by the facts and decades of New Hampshire law. And we fully expect the decision will be upheld. 
Third, we reached the settlement agreement with New Hampshire public utility commission staff that if approved by the commission, we'll affirm that the designation of Northern Pass transmission as a state utility a required step in the overall project approval process. That designation is predicated on finding up public good and will allow Northern Pass to operate transmission facilities in the State at New Hampshire. As part of the agreement, Northern Pass committed that the Forward New Hampshire plan 
will provide $20 million or $2 million a year for 10 years for programs or initiatives approved by the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission that advance energy efficiency, clean energy innovation, community betterment and economic development in New Hampshire. 
Fourth, in June, our partner Hydro-Quebec received approval for its portion of the project on the Canadian side from Quebec's Energy board, while a couple of additional approvals are necessary north of the border, one from the province and another from Canada's National Energy Board, this progress is consistent with our timetable for the United States portion of the project. 
Fifth and most recently, on July 19, ISO-New England issued its I-39 approval in Northern Pass, finding that the project as now proposed will not have a significant adverse affect on the liability of the regions grid. If the New Hampshire SEC issues a written order approving the 192 mile New Hampshire section in September 2017, we would be in a position to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval that fall and commence construction by the end of 2017. Based upon that schedule, we should be in a position to complete the project in 2018 and '19. And as you can see on Slide 10, bring it into service by the end of 2019. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn the Access Northeast on Slide 11. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England. That percentage will grow as plants that have cleared the New England capacity process add nearly another 2,600 megawatts of natural gas generation that would be connected to the project. Access Northeast allows firm deliveries directly to power plants to ensure that they can operate when they are needed most. 
Turning to Slide 12. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England in the winter months, the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. 
Slide 12 looks at New England and MISO power crisis in the summer of 2015 and compares them to the winter of 2014, '15. You can see that in the summer, our wholesale electricity prices are actually a bit lower than MISOs, but during the cold winter, they can be 3x higher than MISOs. Access Northeast will address that challenge by providing 900 million cubic feet a day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient, low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop. Improved reliability, fuel supply will save New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the winter of 2013 and '14 period. 
On Slide 13, you can see how our regions fuel mix shifts from natural gas to oil and coal when temperatures fall. December 2014 was a long month and as a result very little coal or oil was burned. January and February of 2015 were quite cold, so less natural gas was available to generators and much more coal and oil were burned. This has not only increased the region's prices, increased the region's greenhouse gas emissions, which all New England states are committed to reduce significantly over the course of the next 3 decades. 
Slide 14 illustrates the beneficial environmental impact Access Northeast can have on our region. By burning natural gas in new efficient plants rather than coal and oil in much older high heat rig plants, we can avoid the emissions of 3.4 million tons of CO2 each winter, which is equivalent taking about 650,000 cars off the road each year. 
As you can see on Slide 15 providing adequate year-round natural gas supplies is also critical to increasing the region's use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. The slide illustrates how much we expect renewable sources to grow in New England. Natural gas generation, much more so than older nuclear and coal and oil units can provide a rapid response to changing grid demand and weather conditions. This is critical to operating a reliable grid. On the siding level, we continue to move through the FERC pre-application process and expect to be in a position to make our formal application in the fourth quarter of this year. On the state regulatory level, we have a number of developments over the past few months. As you can see on Slide 16. In May, the public utility commission voted on July 19 to endorse a contract with Access Northeast, assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. We view this as a positive development for the project because the state commission concluded, after a lengthy independent review, that customers would benefit from Access Northeast. Further, the commission approved the business model of the electric utilities entering into a pipeline capacity contract. 
In Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities will commence hearings next week on a 20-year natural gas capacity contracts that Access Northeast has signed with Eversource and National Grid Electric Utilities in Massachusetts. Hearings are due to conclude in mid-August and we are -- we expect for approvals this fall. You may recall that the DPU ruled that it had authority under existing state statute to approve such contracts. A couple of project opponents appeal to defuse order to the state's Supreme Judicial Court, claiming the commission lacks such authority. That case is pending and we expect a decision later this summer. 
In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, issued an RFP for natural gas capacity at the beginning of June with bids due on June 29. The department received 7 bids, which it is now evaluating and is expected to announce the winner or winners by the end of August with filings on PURA by the end of October. Once contracts are filed, PURA has up to 90 days to rule on them.
In New Hampshire, the Public Utility Commission is now evaluating the gas supply contract with Access Northeast and public service of New Hampshire, which was filed earlier this year. The PUC's review is in 2 parts. The first is to determine whether the PU staff was correct last year when they determined that the commission has the authority to approve such contracts. The second part requires the commission determine to whether the contract is in the customer's best interest. We are now awaiting a ruling on the first phase of that docket. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast capacity on June 30. A decision is due before the end of October of this year. The bottom line is that Access Northeast continues to make significant progress on multiple fronts. I don't have to remind you what is at stake here in New England, breaking point with more than 1,500 megawatts of generation that can burn coal or oil will shut down in 2 months. The Pilgrim nuclear power facility with nearly 700 megawatts will retire in 2 years. The issue in New England is not only the additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion that customers pay to interpret the power. It's where even with high prices, we have enough fuel during the coldest winter evenings to keep the customers lights on. We expect to begin construction of Access Northeast by mid-2018. We had said before certain elements of the pipeline should enter into service in 2018, with additional pipeline segments and 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage entering service in subsequent years. 
So now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A."

Also identified approximately $200 million of other transmission projects, either incremental projects or possibly a move of some projects, but essentially incremental projects to fill in 2017.

And of course, if you look at Northern Pass right now, I mean, we have cleared many, if not most, of the hurdles on Northern Pass. The opponents of the project who have litigated have lost. We feel very confident in that project. It's a great deal. There will never be another deal like that, because the way that is bid essentially customers would pay a little -- approximately about 60% of the cost of the project. The project saves billions of dollars, it reduces 3 million to 4 million tons of carbon a year. If you look at Massachusetts, which has very aggressive goals in reduction, additional material litigation with Conservation Law Foundation with Massachusetts, DPU, that now requires that the state put together goals and objectives that demonstrate reductions of carbon. That's the biggest -- if you want lower carbon reduction, you bring on Canadian hydropower. Again, that's probably the best deal around and there probably never be another one like it, where you have Hydro-Québec willing to pay $600 million of their own transmission on their side. So I have very high confidence in both of those projects. They're complex. They've taken lots of twists and turns, but we believe both of them are moving in the right direction."

And I guess first of all, I would say the thesis which we have at FERC here for precedent is no different than what takes place right now for the LDC companies, where the LDC companies pay for pipeline infrastructure that's developed by a pipeline operator. And as a result, they get first preference on it and then whatever capacity, if they don't use, it goes into the marketplace. So this would work essentially the same. And so clearly, anyone that has watched the window and the ones who knows that there's not enough gas and that hinders the marketplace and forces a lot of plants offline that would otherwise run should they be gas. Development of a pipeline in having long-term capacity contracts with EDCs, we believe will stimulate the competitive marketplace and do what it's really designed to do which is to have the older, more inefficient, more higher emission plants retire and have new plants come on through the fuller capacity market process. So if you -- if for some reason that we don't expect that FERC rules adversely against the project as in sides with generators, and in this particular case, or at least a couple of them, the project is still viable. The savings will still be large because the gas will flow into the market, whether it's through a wholesale supplier, a marketer, it will still find its way to the market.

Today I'll cover our second quarter and first half financial results, recent legislative and regulatory developments in our 3 states, an update on certain transmission projects and a review of recent financing and rating agency activity. 
So let's start with the quarter and that's on Slide 4. We earned $203.6 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $207.5 million or $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our transmission segment earned $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factor driving the earnings growth was higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued investment in the reliability of New England power grid. I'll summarize some of the key reliability driven transmission projects in a moment. 
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.38 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary factors driving this decrease were: High depreciation and property taxes; higher interest expense; and the absence this year of a regulatory true-up that CL&P recorded in the second quarter of 2015, as a result of the final Connecticut pure regulatory decision involving deferred taxes. Additionally, O&M was somewhat higher during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of last year, but that was primarily due to timing issues attributable to last year's weather impacts. 
On the natural gas side, we earned $0.06 -- $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were higher revenues that resulted from the NSTAR Gas rate increase that took effect January 1 of 2016; and cooler early spring weather in 2016 compared with 2015, which increased sales. 
Turning from the second quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $447.8 million or $1.41 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $460.8 million or $1.45 per share in the first half of 2015. Transmission earnings totaled $0.56 per share compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the first half of 2015. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to the FERC commission decision on the first complaint against the returns on equity earned by New England Transmission Owners. 
Our electric distribution and generation segment earned $0.66 per share in the first half of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.80 per share in the first half of 2015. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution systems reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Our natural gas distribution segment earned $0.19 per share in the first half of 2016, unchanged from the first half of 2015. The mild first quarter weather which significantly reduced natural gas sales was essentially offset by a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth. We added nearly 4,700 space heating customers in the first 6 months of 2016 and continue to target 12,500 new heating customers this year. And conversion activity generally picks up in September and we expect to see the same trend this year. 
O&M continues to be a very good story this year. Our employees continued to provide excellent reliability for our customers while at the same time reducing costs. We are very proud of our service reliability here at Eversource. In 2015, we had the best reliability in the company's history and performed in the top quartile of the industry. That same high reliability continues in 2016. 
Turning back to O&M, you may recall that last year, our first quarter O&M was $0.05 per share lower due to the resolution of a bad debt dispute we had in Massachusetts. If we exclude that impact, lower O&M has added $0.04 per share to midyear results in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. And we expect lower O&M to continue to benefit the results in the second half of the year. 
In June, we moved away from 2 legacy payroll and benefit systems into one common platform. This is the latest in the number of systems conversions and process improvements that we've completed to make ourselves more efficient and better able to provide great service to our 3.6 million customers. 
With a good 6 months behind us, we feel very good about where we are this year. We've affirmed our full year guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 as well as our long-term earnings-per-share growth in the 5% to 7% range. 
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmissions investments totaled $360 million in the first half of 2016, and we continue to target transmission and capital investments of about $910 million for the full year. As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects: The Greater Boston Reliability Solution and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut solution. In the second quarter, we received Connecticut Siting Council approval for a new $50 million transmission line, west of Hartford and a series of improvement in the Bloomfield winter area north of Hartford. Both of these projects are part of the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut project and construction is expected to begin next quarter. To date, we've invested $80 million in Greater Hartford projects and continue to expect to invest $350 million by the time they are completed in late 2018. 
On Greater Boston, you may have seen the news release earlier this month concerning the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee's approval of the Merrimack Value Reliability projects, which we and National Grid are building in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Our share of that project is $37 million, and we expect to begin construction this fall. I should also note that the estimated total cost for the Greater Boston suite of projects has increased modestly from $544 million to $565 million. And we continue to expect completing them by the end of 2019. We've invested approximately $78 million on these projects to date. 
The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has another large project before it in addition to Northern Pass and Merrimack Valley. In June, the committee accepted as complete our application to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect the Site Evaluation Committee decision on this application by mid-2017 and to complete the seacoast project by the end of 2018. We have invested nearly $10 million in this project to date. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6 and recent developments involving legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In April, Massachusetts amended its laws to encourage continued expansion of solar generation in the state. In addition to raising solar net metering caps, the new law allows Massachusetts Electric Utilities to file with the DPU to construct up to 35 megawatts of solar generation. On June 30, NSTAR Electric filed an application with the Department of Public Utilities to build 35 megawatts of solar generation facilities. And Western Mass Electric company, which already has 8 megawatts of solar generation, applied to develop an additional 27 megawatts of solar generation. Together, we would expect to invest approximately $200 million in these new facilities. 
The statute requires the DPU to issue a decision on our applications by the year-end 2016 and for us to complete construction by the end of 2017. We would expect a return that is consistent with our allowed distribution ROEs. These expenditures are incremental to the capital investment plan that we presented in February. 
Also in Massachusetts, there's new legislation before the Senate and the House that would help the state move its clean energy goals. The House and Senate have approved different versions of the legislation over the last several weeks, and now have a conference committee working to iron out a compromised version. Both versions call for contracting a significant quantities of clean power from facilities such as offshore wind and other sources such as hydroelectric plants. The current session ends on Sunday. So by Monday, we should know the final outcome of this bill. 
Turning from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. On July 1, the New Hampshire PUC approved our comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, public service in New Hampshire's generating rate base included undepreciated plan, fuel and inventory totals of approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process would be recovered through securitization. 
The next step of this process is for the New Hampshire PUC to select an auction adviser to assist in the sale of the plants. We expect that selection to be finalized during the first half of September, and we anticipate that the entire sale securitization process will be completed in the second half of 2017. 
Continuing into financing, NSTAR Electric issued $250 million of 10-year unsecured debentures in May. Proceeds were primarily used to refinance $200 million maturing debt. Also in June, Western Mass Electric closed on the sale of $50 million of 10-year unsecured notes. 
Turning to Slide 7. We've also had some positive news about our credit ratings and outlooks. Moody's upgraded both public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass, and Fitch upgraded CL&P as well as public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass Electric. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's moved all of our outlooks to positive. These outlooks are a great testament to the company's strong financial position. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee."
292525,375943694,1018568,"Eversource Energy, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Phil.

There have been a number of developments involving NPT since our most",1681,"Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Let’s start with Northern Pass on Slide 9. There have been a number of developments involving NPT since our most recent earnings call in early May. On June 23, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee or SEC approved a detailed schedule for its review of Northern Pass. Among the key dates, the schedule calls for intervenor testimony by November 15, supplemental testimony by March 15, 2017, and a final prehearing conference by the end of March 2017. This schedule supports a final decision no later than September 2017. We are very encouraged by a series of other developments that have occurred with Northern Pass since our last earnings call. Developments that underscore the benefits that the project will bring to New Hampshire in the coming decades. 
First, public service PSNH last month filed with the PUC a 20-year power purchase agreement with a Hydro-Quebec affiliate that will guarantee its customers with up to 100 megawatts of favorably priced clean on-peak power. 
Second, in May, a litigation brought by certain project opponents when the Hampshire superior court rented a summary judgment in favor of Northern Pass. The court determined the State Department of Transportation, not project opponents, had exclusive authority to allow the project to be varied in the public right away in a small section of state highway in Northern Hampshire. Those project opponents have appealed that decision to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, but the lower court 's reasoning was well supported by the facts and decades of New Hampshire law. And we fully expect the decision will be upheld. 
Third, we reached the settlement agreement with New Hampshire public utility commission staff that if approved by the commission, we'll affirm that the designation of Northern Pass transmission as a state utility a required step in the overall project approval process. That designation is predicated on finding up public good and will allow Northern Pass to operate transmission facilities in the State at New Hampshire. As part of the agreement, Northern Pass committed that the Forward New Hampshire plan 
will provide $20 million or $2 million a year for 10 years for programs or initiatives approved by the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission that advance energy efficiency, clean energy innovation, community betterment and economic development in New Hampshire. 
Fourth, in June, our partner Hydro-Quebec received approval for its portion of the project on the Canadian side from Quebec's Energy board, while a couple of additional approvals are necessary north of the border, one from the province and another from Canada's National Energy Board, this progress is consistent with our timetable for the United States portion of the project. 
Fifth and most recently, on July 19, ISO-New England issued its I-39 approval in Northern Pass, finding that the project, as now proposed, will not have a significant adverse effect on the liability of the regions grid. If the New Hampshire SEC issues a written order approving the 192 mile New Hampshire section in September 2017, we would be in a position to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval that fall and commence construction by the end of 2017. Based upon that schedule, we should be in a position to complete the project in 2018 and '19. And as you can see on Slide 10, bring it into service by the end of 2019. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn the Access Northeast on Slide 11. Our share of Access Northeast is 40% or $1.2 billion. Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England. That percentage will grow as plants that have cleared the New England capacity process add nearly another 2,600 megawatts of natural gas generation that would be connected to the project. Access Northeast allows firm deliveries directly to power plants to ensure that they can operate when they are needed most. 
Turning to Slide 12. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England in the winter months, the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. 
Slide 12 looks at New England and MISO power crisis in the summer of 2015 and compares them to the winter of 2014, '15. You can see that in the summer, our wholesale electricity prices are actually a bit lower than MISOs, but during the cold winter, they can be 3x higher than MISOs. Access Northeast will address that challenge by providing 900 million cubic feet a day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient, low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop. Improved reliability, fuel supply will save New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the winter of 2013 and '14 period. 
On Slide 13, you can see how our regions fuel mix shifts from natural gas to oil and coal when temperatures fall. December 2014 was a long month and as a result very little coal or oil was burned. January and February of 2015 were quite cold, so less natural gas was available to generators and much more coal and oil were burned. This has not only increased the region's prices, increased the region's greenhouse gas emissions, which all New England states are committed to reduce significantly over the course of the next 3 decades. 
Slide 14 illustrates the beneficial environmental impact Access Northeast can have on our region. By burning natural gas in new efficient plants rather than coal and oil in much older high heat rig plants, we can avoid the emissions of 3.4 million tons of CO2 each winter, which is equivalent taking about 650,000 cars off the road each year. 
As you can see on Slide 15 providing adequate year-round natural gas supplies is also critical to increasing the region's use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. The slide illustrates how much we expect renewable sources to grow in New England. Natural gas generation, much more so than older nuclear and coal and oil units can provide a rapid response to changing grid demand and weather conditions. This is critical to operating a reliable grid. On the siding level, we continue to move through the FERC pre-application process and expect to be in a position to make our formal application in the fourth quarter of this year. On the state regulatory level, we have a number of developments over the past few months. As you can see on Slide 16. In May, the public utility commission voted on July 19 to endorse a contract with Access Northeast, assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. We view this as a positive development for the project because the state commission concluded, after a lengthy independent review, that customers would benefit from Access Northeast. Further, the commission approved the business model of the electric utilities entering into a pipeline capacity contract. 
In Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities will commence hearings next week on a 20-year natural gas capacity contracts that Access Northeast has signed with Eversource and National Grid Electric Utilities in Massachusetts. Hearings are due to conclude in mid-August and we are -- we expect for approvals this fall. You may recall that the DPU ruled that it had authority under existing state statute to approve such contracts. A couple of project opponents appeal to defuse order to the state's Supreme Judicial Court, claiming the commission lacks such authority. That case is pending and we expect a decision later this summer. 
In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, issued an RFP for natural gas capacity at the beginning of June with bids due on June 29. The department received 7 bids, which it is now evaluating and is expected to announce the winner or winners by the end of August with filings on PURA by the end of October. Once contracts are filed, PURA has up to 90 days to rule on them.
In New Hampshire, the Public Utility Commission is now evaluating the gas supply contract with Access Northeast and public service of New Hampshire, which was filed earlier this year. The PUC's review is in 2 parts. The first is to determine whether the PU staff was correct last year when they determined that the commission has the authority to approve such contracts. The second part requires the commission determine to whether the contract is in the customer's best interest. We are now awaiting a ruling on the first phase of that docket. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast capacity on June 30. A decision is due before the end of October of this year. The bottom line is that Access Northeast continues to make significant progress on multiple fronts. I don't have to remind you what is at stake here in New England, breaking point with more than 1,500 megawatts of generation that can burn coal or oil will shut down in 2 months. The Pilgrim nuclear power facility with nearly 700 megawatts will retire in 2 years. The issue in New England is not only the additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion that customers pay to interpret the power. It's where even with high prices, we have enough fuel during the coldest winter evenings to keep the customers lights on. We expect to begin construction of Access Northeast by mid-2018. We had said before certain elements of the pipeline should enter into service in 2018, with additional pipeline segments and 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage entering service in subsequent years. 
So now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A."

There are 6 tracks out there that have been leased by the Federal government through the Bureau of Offshore Energy Management. And we have to see what the final legislation says. Clearly, all of that offshore wind, which could be sizable over a long period of time will need transmission development to connect it into the grid in Southeast Massachusetts.

I view both of these projects with a very, very high level of success and high probability. I mean, looking at Access Northeast, clearly, there is the need for gas because without that gas, reliability will be threatened without that gas. We'll not be able to go forward and bring on scale or bring online the large-scale renewable projects, whether it's offshore wind, onshore wind. We just won't be able to do that. We won't be able to manage the reliability of the grid without having that kind of fast start, quick following capability that you get with gas-fired combined cycle or simple cycle plants. And of course, if you look at Northern Pass right now, I mean, we have cleared many, if not most, of the hurdles on Northern Pass. The opponents of the project who have litigated have lost. We feel very confident in that project. It's a great deal. There will never be another deal like that, because the way that is bid essentially customers would pay a little -- approximately about 60% of the cost of the project. The project saves billions of dollars, it reduces 3 million to 4 million tons of carbon a year. If you look at Massachusetts, which has very aggressive goals in reduction, additional material litigation with Conservation Law Foundation with Massachusetts, DPU, that now requires that the state put together goals and objectives that demonstrate reductions of carbon. That's the biggest -- if you want lower carbon reduction, you bring on Canadian hydropower. Again, that's probably the best deal around and there probably never be another one like it, where you have Hydro-Québec willing to pay $600 million of their own transmission on their side. So I have very high confidence in both of those projects. They're complex. They've taken lots of twists and turns, but we believe both of them are moving in the right direction."

And I guess first of all, I would say the thesis which we have at FERC here for precedent is no different than what takes place right now for the LDC companies, where the LDC companies pay for pipeline infrastructure that's developed by a pipeline operator. And as a result, they get first preference on it and then whatever capacity, if they don't use, it goes into the marketplace. So this would work essentially the same. And so clearly, anyone that has watched the window and the ones who knows that there's not enough gas and that hinders the marketplace and forces a lot of plants offline that would otherwise run should they be gas. Development of a pipeline in having long-term capacity contracts with EDCs, we believe will stimulate the competitive marketplace and do what it's really designed to do which is to have the older, more inefficient, more higher emission plants retire and have new plants come on through the fuller capacity market process. So if you -- if for some reason that we don't expect that FERC rules adversely against the project as in sides with generators, and in this particular case, or at least a couple of them, the project is still viable. The savings will still be large because the gas will flow into the market, whether it's through a wholesale supplier, a marketer, it will still find its way to the market. It may have a slightly higher price, but it will still find its way to the market."

Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3",1735,"Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3 states.
So let's start with the quarter on Slide 4. We earned $265.3 million or $0.83 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $235.9 million or $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our Transmission segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.24 per share in the third quarter last year. The primary driver of the earnings growth is the higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued needed investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. 
I'll summarize some of our key reliability driven transmission projects in a minute.
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2016, which is the same number as the third quarter of 2015. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher depreciation, property taxes and interest costs. 
On the natural gas side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of '16 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of last year. Higher interest in taxes more than offset the benefits of the rate increase set, NSTAR Gas and the increased revenues from our natural gas infrastructure tracking mechanisms.
Turning from the third quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $713.1 million or $2.24 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $696.7 million or $2.19 per share in the first 9 months of 2015. 
In our earnings press release, we reiterated both our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and our 2016 earnings projection of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. At this time, we expect to finish 2016 somewhere in the middle of that range.
Transmission earnings totaled to $0.84 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared to earnings of $0.70 per share in the first 9 months of last year. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision on the first complaint against the returns of -- on equity earned by the New England Transmission Owners. 
Our Electric Distribution and Generation segment earned $1.20 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared with earnings of $1.32 per share for the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share total of benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. 
Additionally, higher depreciation in property taxes resulted -- resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution system reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment turned $0.16 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.18 per share for the same period last year. A milder first quarter weather this year with significantly reduce natural gas sales were partially offset by rate increases at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth.
O&M continues to be some a very good story this year as our employees continue to provide excellent reliability for our customers, while also reducing cost. Lower O&M has added $0.07 per share to earnings so far this year if we exclude the $0.05 of benefits we recorded in the first quarter of '15 when we successfully resolved the bad debt dispute in Massachusetts.
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $559 million in the first 9 months of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of about $910 million for the full year.
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. Last month, we announced that we had received approval of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, a nearly $125 million transmission project in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which we and National Grid are building. 
Today, we've invested $91 million in the approximately 565 million set of Greater Boston Solutions. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019. 
As we've done in past years, we expect to provide you with our 2017 earnings guidance and our full year capital expenditure projections during our year end earnings call in February. I'll just cover one area now. During our July earnings call, we discussed the impact of a 9-month extension of the state review of Northern Pass on our 2017 capital budget, and we indicated that other projects are being identified to offset about $600 million reduction in projected Northern Pass CapEx in 2017. In July, we noted an additional $200 million of transmission reliability projects, about $200 million of solar projects in Massachusetts and $30 million to $50 million of additional investments in our Natural Gas Distribution segment.
Since then, we've identified about $50 million of additional transmission reliability projects above the original $200 million, and we -- and as we move through our 2017 budget process, that could go higher. 
We'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities as we move through the next few months and give a complete update during our year-end earnings call.
I also want to touch on Capital Expenditures and our Natural Gas Distribution segment. We've invested $180 million in that segment through the first 9 months of 2016, up approximately 35% from the same period last year. This increase primarily represents an acceleration of cast iron and various steel pipe replacement in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, an increased level of work this year in our LNG facility where we are undertaking a $200 million upgrade and increased expansion activity at Yankee Gas. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6 in recent developments involving the legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On August 8, Governor Baker signed, in Massachusetts, signed an act to promote energy diversity. The Bill requires the state to contract for 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind over the next 11 years in solicitations of at least 400 megawatts a piece. Subsequently, Gov. Baker announced that several firms have acquired fair releases to attractive offshore wind sites that are 25 to 50 miles South of Cape Cod had also agreed to lease a location in Bedford, Massachusetts for their staging the construction activities. Massachusetts is clearly positioning itself to be a national leader in offshore wind development. 
We look forward to supporting that effort and believe there will be considerable opportunities for Eversource to build transmission over the coming decades to connect that offshore wind to the electric load. 
The Act also calls for Massachusetts electric companies to commence competitive solicitations by April 2017 for nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours of additional clean energy annually. Again, we look forward to working with our policymakers on helping to provide the transmission links that will bring that clean energy to Massachusetts consumers.
As you were likely aware, the 3 state Clean Energy RFP was conducted this year by Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. That concluded last week with selections focused on small scale renewables, and as a result, neither Northern Pass nor Clean Energy Connect was selected. The state shows only 460 megawatts of Class 1 renewables, about 2/3 of that solar and 1/3 wind. 
Our 2 bids included hydroelectric generation that did not strictly meet the Class 1 criteria in the RFP. We're focusing our efforts on the next round of contracting that is immediately around the corner. That involves solicitations for the nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours with the Massachusetts legislation explicitly allows large hydroelectric sources to participate. We believe that both Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect would be excellent candidates for these next solicitations due to their potentially significant impact on lowering carbon emissions. 
Northern Pass alone would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.3 million tons a year, the equivalent of taking about 690,000 cars off the road. It may make Massachusetts roads safer too. I don't know.
Switching from the regulatory slide, Slide 7. Here and begin tomorrow, actually, on our proposal to build up to 62 megawatts of solar generation in Massachusetts at a cost of about $200 million. On the legislation passed in April of this year, each Massachusetts electric utility is allowed to own and operate up to 35 megawatts of solar. western Mass Electric already has 8 megawatts of solar under a prior authorization, so we can had an additional 27 megawatts. NSTAR Electric has none, so we can build 35 megawatts. A DPU decision is due by the end of this year with construction targeted for completion by the end of next year. 
In New Hampshire, the state approved our JPMorgan as the auction adviser for the divestiture of our 1,200 megawatts of regulated generation. JPMorgan has submitted a proposal for conducting the auction, which the New Hampshire Public Utility Public Commission is now considering. That proposal calls for active marketing to take place in early 2017. 
We are targeting the second half of 2017 for completing the divestiture process. You recall that the New Hampshire legislation enables the recovery of all of our plant investment either through the sale proceeds or through securitization. 
Turning to Slide 8. You can see the current status of the various return on equity complaints before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to transmission investment in New England. The latest development involves the fourth complaint on September 20. The FERC accepted the complaint and subsequently assigned a settlement judge to the case. If we do not settle, FERC expects that an order in the complaint will be issued in mid-2018. 
We continue to record earnings based on our original October 2014 decision in the first complaint even though that case remains on appeal before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where oral arguments have been scheduled for December 6. 
We look forward to seeing many of you who are on this call at the EEI Financial Conference. And now, I'll turn it over to Lee."
292525,406987983,1069691,"Eversource Energy, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major engagement initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10.

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major engagement initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our late July earnings call. On October 14, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission issued an order authorizing Northern Pass to do business as a New Hampshire Utility. In reaching its decision, the commission approved a settlement agreement between Northern Pass and the PUC staff that determined that Northern Pass had the technical, managerial and financial expertise to operate as a public utility. The PUC further concluded that, “Rent in Northern Pass Authority to commence business just tas a public utility is for the public good.”. 
We're pleased to have to received this important foundational ruling. In September and October, the New Hampshire Evaluation Committee, or SEC, held more than 20 days of hearings or technical sessions on the project, which featured 10 panels of witnesses on top is that included system stability, reliability, project construction and historical resources. The sessions allowed intervenors to question our witnesses on all aspects of the project based on testimony that was submitted as part of the SEC application last fall. We're very pleased with how well these sessions went overall. 
They were an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate the thoughtful planning design and engineering that we have already devoted to this project and to underscore the significant economic and environmental benefits Northern Pass will provide the region. 
The next key milestone is the submission of intervenor testimony in mid-November. Reports from the said agencies that are reviewing the project are due to the Site Evaluation Committee by March 1, and we anticipate the final committee hearings starting in April of next year. A final written decision is expected by September 30 of 2017. 
If the Committee issues a written or approving the 192-mile New Hampshire section of Northern Pass in September of 2017, we would expect to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval by the end of 2017. Based on that schedule, we should be in the position to construct the project during the 2018 and '19 time frame as indicated on Slide 11. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on Slide 12. On the state regulatory level, we've had a number of developments over the past few months as you can see on Slide 13. The most important developments occurred in mid-August when Massachusetts Supreme Court judicial Court ruled that under current state law, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cannot approve natural gas transmission contracts signed by electric distribution companies. As a result of that court decision, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies requested that they be allowed to withdraw the contracts between Access Northeast and Eversource's Massachusetts electric utilities and National Grid. That request was accepted by the DPU last month, so there is no contract currently pending before the DPU related to Access Northeast.
In New Hampshire, the PUC ruled on October 6 that under current state law, it does not have the authority to approve natural gas to pass in contracts for elected distribution companies. The ruling reversed a PUC staff finding issued a year ago and was disappointing to us. In its order, the commission cited similar reasoning to the Massachusetts court decision and even cited that decision in the footnote. Requesting reconsideration from the commission would be required before an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court could be considered by Eversource New Hampshire. 
There have also been developments in others states since our late July earnings call. In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Protection, or DEEP, last week canceled the natural gas RFP edition in June, noting developments in other states and noted that it will continue to monitor the market and activities outside Connecticut and could reinitiate an RFP anytime. 
In Maine, a written order was issued last month affirming the PUC's July 19 vote to endorse a contract with Access Northeast assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators in long-term contract for Access Northeast Capacity on June 30.  In September, the Rhode Island PUC placed a stay on the docket and requested an update from National Grid in mid-January. We believe the PUC's action was appropriate, given the uncertainty in Massachusetts. 
Given the current status of the state regulatory proceedings we're reviewing, the changes we may need to make in the projects configuration to serve both EDCs and LDC laws. As a result, we believe the construction is not likely to commence until the spring or summer 2019, which would represent a 9- to 12-month change from our previous estimate.
One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England during the winter months, the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run up our power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem since it passes through Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts, the 2 most densely populated parts of the wind mill in Texas' 60% of the region's gas-fired power generation. 
Slide 14 shows you the current natural gas supply situation in New England. Pipeline fit reaches from the West to New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario currently can deliver up to 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day on cold winter days. However, the region's LDC loads alone can exceed 4 billion cubic feet per day. 
The difference is bridged by vaporizing stored energy and by plants switching to oil and increasing their carbon output. Exacerbating this issue is the decline of the Eastern Canadian offshore natural gas production, which is likely to continue further diminishing supplies for natural gas to the region. 
Slide 15 shows what is happening with our regions' generation fleet. New England has more than 15,000 megawatts of generation where natural gas is the primary fuel. Only about 1/3 of that generation is [indiscernible] fuel. The other 10,000-plus megawatts only burn natural gas, and you can see the virtually none of the generation has from natural gas supplies. 
Our situation will only get worse as breaking point program and other nonnatural gas units retire over the course of the next 2.5 years are replaced by gas burning units. 
ISO-New England is calling that situation precarious. We believe there are very real concerns on reliability of a significant additional sources of natural gas can be brought into New England. Earlier, Phil discussed the results of 3  state Clean Energy RFP. The projects selected for contract negotiations in the RFP will add some Class 1 renewable resources, but will do very little to address these natural gas capacity issues, which are most acute during the cold winter months. And the reliability is just one issue. You can see the price differential that existed in New England to winters go on Slide 15 where still power prices were about 300x higher during the winter than they were during the previous summer. Cost of customs ultimately pay. 
In a normal year, the price differential is about $1 billion. In a cold winter, it's significantly more. Ultimately, we firmly believe that the region's need for additional pipeline capacity to the West and Access Northeast's unique attributes will result in our project moving forward. We and our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid, remain committed to the project and the $1 billion a year in benefits in bringing to New England customers. 
The 2 pass in the Massachusetts that we are -- have identified involve contracting with the states' natural gas distribution companies for capacity and seeking new enabling legislation. 
Regarding the legislation -- the legislative option, the Massachusetts legislature will reconvene in early 2017, so a new statute similar to loss that didn't pass in recent years in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, could be voted on by mid-2017. At a recent meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern and Governors, Massachusetts Governor Baker expressed his explicit support for additional natural gas supplies for the state, and we believe there is significant support in the state to increase access of additional gas supplies. But we understand that there would be opposition in such legislation from various stakeholder interest as they were in Connecticut before a similar law was passed there. 
In regards to natural gas distribution company option, I will remind you that [indiscernible] Morgan's Northeast Energy Direct Project had signed several gas capacity, primarily with Massachusetts and New Hampshire gas distribution companies before Ginter canceled the project earlier this year.  We are currently exploring where the Access Northeast can help meet the growing long-term gas needs of these distribution companies. There is no question that both the regions, electric and natural gas consumers, needed the additional pipeline capacity that Access Northeast can provide and that citing a projects on an existing right away and an existing LNG storage site, is by far, the most attractive option.

And so once you start getting up around 500,000, that makes the project more viable. But we have not made a complete determination on that yet because we still think there is a need for the EDC participation in the other state. So we think there could be hybrid solution of both LDCs and EDC contracts."

So you've seen cost as high as $0.24, $0.25 a kilowatt hour. Our recent tenders done in Europe and Holland for less than $0.10 per kilowatt hour. So we believe with the economy of scale and the development in places, such as in Asia or China, which is starting to take place now is we'll see a fairly dramatic decrease. I think the other thing that Jeff remembered too is that the load centers and the win-win around the shoreline, and if you have offshore wind, it's closer to the load. So, therefore, your transmission cost declined significantly and yes, offshore wind comes on. But essentially, 10 turbines at a time, it doesn't come on like a traditional generator where you spend 5 years building a 1,000 megawatts and one push of the button, it all comes on. It's -- every 8 megawatts, it comes on. So it rolls in overtime, but it has a better cost recovery curve as well."

And obviously, investors are going to shift to 2020 and beyond, especially now given the delay of Access Northeast, which, hopefully, wasn't a surprise to people. But the question is knowing how you've been able to backfill your growth, knowing sort of the reliability spending. You've done a pretty good job about negating the delay of Northern Pass, do you sort of -- I mean, envision 5% to 7% potentially being put in jeopardy if Access Northeast is further delayed? Or do you have enough on that pipeline, no pun intended, but do you have enough in that pipeline, and reliability or whatever spend that you have that envision 5% to 7% being impacted?"

Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3",1735,"Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3 states.
So let's start with the quarter on Slide 4. We earned $265.3 million or $0.83 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $235.9 million or $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our Transmission segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.24 per share in the third quarter last year. The primary driver of the earnings growth is the higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued needed investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. 
I'll summarize some of our key reliability driven transmission projects in a minute.
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2016, which is the same number as the third quarter of 2015. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher depreciation, property taxes and interest costs. 
On the natural gas side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of '16 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of last year. Higher interest and taxes more than offset the benefits of the rate increase set, NSTAR Gas and the increased revenues from our natural gas infrastructure tracking mechanisms.
Turning from the third quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $713.1 million or $2.24 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $696.7 million or $2.19 per share in the first 9 months of 2015. 
In our earnings press release, we reiterated both our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and our 2016 earnings projection of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. At this time, we expect to finish 2016 somewhere in the middle of that range.
Transmission earnings totaled to $0.84 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared to earnings of $0.70 per share in the first 9 months of last year. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision on the first complaint against the returns of -- on equity earned by the New England Transmission Owners. 
Our Electric Distribution and Generation segment earned $1.20 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared with earnings of $1.32 per share for the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share total of benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. 
Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulted -- resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution system reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.16 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.18 per share for the same period last year. The milder first quarter weather this year with significantly reduced natural gas sales were partially offset by rate increases at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth.
O&M continues to be a very good story this year as our employees continue to provide excellent reliability for our customers, while also reducing cost. Lower O&M has added $0.07 per share to earnings so far this year if we exclude the $0.05 of benefits we recorded in the first quarter of '15 when we successfully resolved the bad debt dispute in Massachusetts.
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $559 million in the first 9 months of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of about $910 million for the full year.
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. Last month, we announced that we had received approval of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, a nearly $125 million transmission project in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which we and National Grid are building. 
Today, we've invested $91 million in the approximately $565 million set of Greater Boston Solutions. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019. 
As we've done in past years, we expect to provide you with our 2017 earnings guidance and our full year capital expenditure projections during our year end earnings call in February. I'll just cover one area now. During our July earnings call, we discussed the impact of a 9-month extension of the state review of Northern Pass on our 2017 capital budget, and we indicated that other projects are being identified to offset about $600 million reduction in projected Northern Pass CapEx in 2017. In July, we noted an additional $200 million in transmission reliability projects, about $200 million of solar projects in Massachusetts and $30 million to $50 million of additional investments in our Natural Gas Distribution segment.
Since then, we've identified about $50 million of additional transmission reliability projects above the original $200 million, and we -- and as we move through our 2017 budget process, that could go higher. 
We'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities as we move through the next few months and give a complete update during our year-end earnings call.
I also want to touch on Capital Expenditures in our Natural Gas Distribution segment. We've invested $180 million in that segment through the first 9 months of 2016, up approximately 35% from the same period last year. This increase primarily represents an acceleration of cast iron and various steel pipe replacement in both Massachusetts and Connecticut. An increased level of work this year in our LNG facility where we are undertaking a $200 million upgrade and increased expansion activity at Yankee Gas. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6, in recent developments involving the legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On August 8, Governor Baker signed, in Massachusetts, signed an act to promote energy diversity. The bill requires the state to contract for a 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind over the next 11 years in solicitations of at least 400 megawatts a piece. Subsequently, Governor Baker announced that several firms have acquired fair releases to attractive offshore wind sites that are 25 to 50 miles South of Cape Cod had also agreed to lease a location in New Bedford, Massachusetts for their staging the construction activities. Massachusetts is clearly positioning itself to be a national leader in offshore wind development. 
We look forward to supporting that effort and believe there will be considerable opportunities for Eversource to build transmission over the coming decades to connect that offshore wind to the electric load. 
The Act also calls for Massachusetts electric companies to commence competitive solicitations by April 2017 for nearly 9,500 gigawatt-hours of additional clean energy annually. Again, we look forward to working with our policymakers on helping to provide the transmission links that will bring that clean energy to Massachusetts consumers.
As you were likely aware, the 3 state Clean Energy RFP was conducted this year by Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. That concluded last week with selections focused on small scale renewables, and as a result, neither Northern Pass nor Clean Energy Connect was selected. The state shows only 460 megawatts of Class 1 renewables, about 2/3 of that solar and 1/3 wind. 
Our 2 bids included hydroelectric generation that did not strictly meet the Class 1 criteria in the RFP. We're focusing our efforts on the next round of contracting that is immediately around the corner. That involves solicitations for the nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours with the Massachusetts legislation explicitly allows large hydroelectric sources to participate. We believe that both Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect would be excellent candidates for these next solicitations due to their potentially significant impact on lowering carbon emissions. 
Northern Pass alone would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.3 million tons a year, the equivalent of taking about 690,000 cars off the road. It may make Massachusetts roads safer too. I don't know.
Switching from the regulatory slide in Slide 7. Hearings begin tomorrow, actually, on our proposal to build up to 62 megawatts of solar generation in Massachusetts at a cost of about $200 million. Under legislation passed in April of this year, each Massachusetts electric utility is allowed to own and operate up to 35 megawatts of solar. Our Western Mass Electric already has 8 megawatts of solar under a prior authorization, so we can add an additional 27 megawatts. NSTAR Electric has none, so we could build 35 megawatts. A DPU decision is due by the end of this year with construction targeted for completion by the end of next year. 
In New Hampshire, the state approved our JPMorgan as the auction adviser for the divestiture of our 1,200 megawatts of regulated generation. JPMorgan has submitted a proposal for conducting the auction, which the New Hampshire Public Utility Public Commission is now considering. That proposal calls for active marketing to take place in early 2017. 
We are targeting the second half of 2017 for completing the divestiture process. You recall that the New Hampshire legislation enables the recovery of all of our plant investment either through the sale proceeds or through securitization. 
Turning to Slide 8. You can see the current status of the various return on equity complaints before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to transmission investment in New England. The latest development involves the fourth complaint on September 20. The FERC accepted the complaint and subsequently assigned a settlement judge to the case. If we do not settle, FERC expects that an order in the complaint will be issued in mid-2018. 
We continue to record earnings based on our original October 2014 decision in the first complaint even though that case remains on appeal before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where oral arguments have been scheduled for December 6. 
We look forward to seeing many of you who are on this call at the EEI Financial Conference. And now, I'll turn it over to Lee."
292525,406987983,1070135,"Eversource Energy, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our",1531,"Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our late July earnings call. On October 14, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission issued an order authorizing Northern Pass to do business as a New Hampshire Utility. In reaching its decision, the commission approved a settlement agreement between Northern Pass and the PUC staff that determined that Northern Pass had the technical, managerial and financial expertise to operate as a public utility. The PUC further concluded that, “Rent in Northern Pass Authority to commence business just as public utility is for the public good.”. 
We're pleased to have received this important foundational ruling. In September and October, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, held more than 20 days of hearings or technical sessions on the project, which featured 10 panels of witnesses on topics that included system stability, reliability, project construction and historical resources. The sessions allowed intervenors to question our witnesses on all aspects of the project based on testimony that was submitted as part of the SEC application last fall. We're very pleased with how well these sessions went overall. 
They were an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate the thoughtful planning design and engineering that we have already devoted to this project and to underscore the significant economic and environmental benefits Northern Pass will provide to the region. 
The next key milestone is the submission of intervenor testimony in mid-November. Reports from the said agencies that are reviewing the project are due to the Site Evaluation Committee by March 1, and we anticipate the final committee hearings starting in April of next year. A final written decision is expected by September 30 of 2017. 
If the Committee issues a written order approving the 192-mile New Hampshire section of Northern Pass in September of 2017, we would expect to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval by the end of 2017. Based on that schedule, we should be in the position to construct the project during the 2018 and '19 time frame as indicated on Slide 11. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on Slide 12. On the state regulatory level, we've had a number of developments over the past few months as you can see on Slide 13. The most important developments occurred in mid-August when Massachusetts Supreme Court -- Judicial Court ruled that under current state law, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cannot approve natural gas transmission contracts signed by electric distribution companies. As a result of that court decision, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies requested that they be allowed to withdraw the contracts between Access Northeast and Eversource's Massachusetts electric utilities and National Grid. That request was accepted by the DPU last month, so there is no contract currently pending before the DPU related to Access Northeast.
In New Hampshire, the PUC ruled on October 6 that under current state law, it does not have the authority to approve natural gas to pass in contracts for electric distribution companies. The ruling reversed a PUC staff finding, issued a year ago and was disappointing to us. In its order, the commission cited similar reasoning to the Massachusetts court decision and even cited that decision in the footnote. Requesting reconsideration from the commission would be required before an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court could be considered by Eversource New Hampshire. 
There have also been developments in others states since our late July earnings call. In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Protection, or DEEP, last week canceled the natural gas RFP auditioned in June, noting developments in other states and noted that it will continue to monitor the market and activities outside Connecticut and could reinitiate an RFP anytime. 
In Maine, a written order was issued last month affirming the PUC's July 19 vote to endorse a contract with Access Northeast assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast Capacity on June 30.  In September, the Rhode Island PUC placed a stay on the docket and requested an update from National Grid in mid-January. We believe the PUC's action was appropriate, given the uncertainty in Massachusetts. 
Given the current status of the state regulatory proceedings we're reviewing, the changes we may need to make in the projects configuration to serve both EDCs and LDC loads. As a result, we believe the construction is not likely to commence until the spring or summer 2019, which would represent a 9- to 12-month change from our previous estimate.
One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England during the winter months: the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem since it passes through Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts, the 2 most densely populated parts of the wind wind [ph] and touches 60% of the region's gas-fired power generation. 
Slide 14 shows you the current natural gas supply situation in New England. Pipeline fit reach us from the West through New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario currently can deliver up to 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day on cold winter days. However, the region's LDC loads alone can exceed 4 billion cubic feet per day. 
The difference is bridged by vaporizing stored LNG and by plants switching to oil and increasing their carbon output. Exacerbating this issue is the decline of the Eastern Canadian offshore natural gas production, which is likely to continue, further diminishing supplies for natural gas to the region. 
Slide 15 shows what is happening with our regions' generation fleet. New England has more than 15,000 megawatts of generation where natural gas is the primary fuel. Only about 1/3 of that generation is dual fuel. The other 10,000-plus megawatts only burn natural gas, and you can see the virtually none of the generation has Firm natural gas supplies. 
Our situation will only get worse as Brayton Point, Pilgrim and other nonnatural gas units retire over the course of the next 2.5 years are replaced by gas burning units. 
ISO-New England is calling that situation precarious. We believe there are very real concerns on unreliability of a significant additional sources of natural gas can be brought into New England. Earlier, Phil discussed the results of 3  state Clean Energy RFP. The projects selected for contract negotiations in the RFP will add some Class 1 renewable resources, but will do very little to address these natural gas capacity issues, which are most acute during the cold winter months. And the reliability is just one issue. You can see the price differential that existed in New England two winters ago on Slide 16. Wholesale power prices were about 300x higher during the winter than they were during the previous summer. Prospective customers ultimately pay. 
In a normal year, the price differential is about $1 billion. In a cold winter, it's significantly more. Ultimately, we firmly believe that the region's need for additional pipeline capacity to the West and Access Northeast's unique attributes will result in our project moving forward. We and our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid, remain committed to the project and the $1 billion a year in benefits we can bring to New England customers. 
The 2 paths in the Massachusetts that we are -- have identified involve contracting with the states' natural gas distribution companies for capacity and seeking new enabling legislation. 
Regarding the legislation -- the legislative option, the Massachusetts legislature will reconvene in early 2017, so a new statute similar to laws that didn't pass in recent years in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, could be voted on by mid-2017. At a recent meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, Massachusetts Governor Baker expressed his explicit support for additional natural gas supplies for the state, and we believe there is significant support in the state to increase access of additional gas supplies. But we understand that there would be opposition to such legislation from various stakeholder interest as they were in Connecticut before a similar law was passed there. 
In regards to natural gas distribution company option, I will remind you that Kinder Morgan's Northeast Energy Direct Project had signed several gas capacity contracts, primarily with Massachusetts and New Hampshire gas distribution companies before Kinder canceled the project earlier this year.  We are currently exploring whether Access Northeast can help meet the growing long-term gas needs of these distribution companies. There is no question that both the region's electric and natural gas consumers need the additional pipeline capacity that Access Northeast can provide and that citing a project on an existing right of way and an existing LNG storage site, is by far, the most attractive option. 
Now let me turn the call back to Jeff."

So you've seen cost as high as $0.24, $0.25 a kilowatt hour. Our recent tenders done in Europe and Holland for less than $0.10 per kilowatt hour. So we believe with the economy of scale and the development in places, such as in Asia or China, which is starting to take place now in Taiwan, we'll see a fairly dramatic decrease. I think the other thing that Jeff remembered too is that the load centers and the wind mill around the shoreline, and if you have offshore wind, it's closer to the load. So, therefore, your transmission cost decline significantly and yes, offshore wind comes on. Essentially 10 turbines at a time, it doesn't come on like a traditional generator where you spend 5 years building a 1,000 megawatts and one push of the button, it all comes on. It's -- every 8 megawatts, it comes on. So it rolls in overtime, but it has a better cost recovery curve as well."

Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3",1738,"Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3 states.
So let's start with the quarter on Slide 4. We earned $265.3 million or $0.83 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $235.9 million or $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our Transmission segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.24 per share in the third quarter last year. The primary driver of the earnings growth is the higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued needed investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. 
I'll summarize some of our key reliability driven transmission projects in a minute.
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2016, which is the same number as the third quarter of 2015. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher depreciation, property taxes and interest costs. 
On the natural gas side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of '16 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of last year. Higher interest and taxes more than offset the benefits of a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and the increased revenues from our natural gas infrastructure tracking mechanisms.
Turning from the third quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $713.1 million or $2.24 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $696.7 million or $2.19 per share in the first 9 months of 2015. 
In our earnings press release, we reiterated both our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and our 2016 earnings projection of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. At this time, we expect to finish 2016 somewhere in the middle of that range.
Transmission earnings totaled to $0.84 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared to earnings of $0.70 per share in the first 9 months of last year. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision on the first complaint against the returns of -- on equity earned by the New England Transmission Owners. 
Our Electric Distribution and Generation segment earned $1.20 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared with earnings of $1.32 per share for the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share total of benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. 
Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulted -- resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution system reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.16 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.18 per share for the same period last year. The milder first quarter weather this year with significantly reduced natural gas sales were partially offset by rate increases at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth.
O&M continues to be a very good story this year as our employees continue to provide excellent reliability for our customers, while also reducing cost. Lower O&M has added $0.07 per share to earnings so far this year if we exclude the $0.05 of benefits we recorded in the first quarter of '15 when we successfully resolved the bad debt dispute in Massachusetts.
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $559 million in the first 9 months of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of about $910 million for the full year.
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. Last month, we announced that we had received approval of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, our  nearly $125 million transmission project in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which we and National Grid are building. 
Today, we've invested $91 million in the approximately $565 million set of Greater Boston Solutions. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019. 
As we've done in past years, we expect to provide you with our 2017 earnings guidance and our full year capital expenditure projections during our year-end earnings call in February. I'll just cover one area now. During our July earnings call, we discussed the impact of a 9-month extension of the state review of Northern Pass on our 2017 capital budget, and we indicated that other projects are being identified to offset about $600 million reduction in projected Northern Pass CapEx in 2017. In July, we noted an additional $200 million in transmission reliability projects, about $200 million of solar projects in Massachusetts and $30 million to $50 million of additional investments in our Natural Gas Distribution segment.
Since then, we've identified about $50 million of additional transmission reliability projects above the original $200 million, and we -- and as we move through our 2017 budget process, that could go higher. 
We'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities as we move through the next few months and give a complete update during our year-end earnings call.
I also want to touch on Capital Expenditures in our Natural Gas Distribution segment. We've invested $180 million in that segment through the first 9 months of 2016, up approximately 35% from the same period last year. This increase primarily represents an acceleration of cast iron and bare steel pipe replacement in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, an increased level of work this year in our LNG facility where we are undertaking a $200 million upgrade and increased expansion activity at Yankee Gas. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6, in recent developments involving the legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On August 8, Governor Baker signed, in Massachusetts, signed an act to promote energy diversity. The bill requires the state to contract for a 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind over the next 11 years in solicitations of at least 400 megawatts a piece. Subsequently, Governor Baker announced that several firms have acquired fairer leases to attractive offshore wind sites that are 25 to 50 miles South of Cape Cod; had also agreed to lease a location in New Bedford, Massachusetts for their staging -- so staging the construction activities. Massachusetts is clearly positioning itself to be a national leader in offshore wind development. 
We look forward to supporting that effort and believe there will be considerable opportunities for Eversource to build transmission over the coming decade to connect that offshore wind to the electric load. 
The Act also calls for Massachusetts electric companies to commence competitive solicitations by April 2017 for nearly 9,500 gigawatt-hours of additional clean energy annually. Again, we look forward to working with our policymakers on helping to provide the transmission links that will bring that clean energy to Massachusetts consumers.
As you are likely aware, the 3 state Clean Energy RFP was conducted this year by Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. That concluded last week with selections focused on small scale renewables and, as a result, neither Northern Pass nor Clean Energy Connect was selected. The state shows only 460 megawatts of Class 1 renewables, about 2/3 of that solar and 1/3 wind. 
Our 2 bids included hydroelectric generation that did not strictly meet the Class 1 criteria in the RFP. We're focusing our efforts on the next round of contracting that is immediately around the corner. That involves solicitations for the nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours, where the Massachusetts legislation explicitly allows large hydroelectric sources to participate. We believe that both Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect would be excellent candidates for these next solicitations due to their potentially significant impact on lowering carbon emissions. 
Northern Pass alone would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.3 million tons a year, the equivalent of taking about 690,000 cars off the road. It may make Massachusetts roads safer, too. I don't know.
Switching from the regulatory slide in Slide 7. Hearings begin tomorrow, actually, on our proposal to build up to 62 megawatts of solar generation in Massachusetts at a cost of about $200 million. Under legislation passed in April of this year, each Massachusetts electric utility is allowed to own and operate up to 35 megawatts of solar. Our Western Mass Electric already has 8 megawatts of solar under a prior authorization, so we can add an additional 27 megawatts. NSTAR Electric has none, so we could build 35 megawatts. A DPU decision is due by the end of this year with construction targeted for completion by the end of next year. 
In New Hampshire, the state approved our -- JPMorgan as the auction adviser for the divestiture of our 1,200 megawatts of regulated generation. JPMorgan has submitted a proposal for conducting the auction, which the New Hampshire Public Utility Public Commission is now considering. That proposal calls for active marketing to take place in early 2017. 
We are targeting the second half of 2017 for completing the divestiture process. You recall that the New Hampshire legislation enables the recovery of all of our plant investment, either through the sale proceeds or through securitization. 
Turning to Slide 8. You can see the current status of the various return on equity complaints before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to transmission investment in New England. The latest development involves the fourth complaint. On September 20, the FERC accepted the complaint and subsequently assigned a settlement judge to the case. If we do not settle, FERC expects that an order in the complaint would be issued in mid-2018. 
We continue to record earnings based on our original October 2014 decision in the first complaint, even though that case remains on appeal before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where oral arguments have been scheduled for December 6. 
We look forward to seeing many of you who are on this call at the EEI Financial Conference. And now, I'll turn it over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our late July earnings call. On October 14, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission issued an order authorizing Northern Pass to do business as a New Hampshire Utility. In reaching its decision, the commission approved a settlement agreement between Northern Pass and the PUC staff that determined that Northern Pass had the technical, managerial and financial expertise to operate as a public utility. The PUC further concluded that, “Rent in Northern Pass Authority to commence business as a public utility is for the public good.”. 
We're pleased to have received this important foundational ruling. In September and October, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, held more than 20 days of hearings or technical sessions on the project, which featured 10 panels of witnesses on topics that included system stability, reliability, project construction and historical resources. The sessions allowed intervenors to question our witnesses on all aspects of the project based on testimony that was submitted as part of the SEC application last fall. We're very pleased with how well these sessions went overall. 
They were an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate the thoughtful planning design and engineering that we have already devoted to this project and to underscore the significant economic and environmental benefits Northern Pass will provide to the region. 
The next key milestone is the submission of intervenor testimony in mid-November. Reports from the said agencies that are reviewing the project are due to the Site Evaluation Committee by March 1, and we anticipate the final committee hearings starting in April of next year. A final written decision is expected by September 30 of 2017. 
If the Committee issues a written order approving the 192-mile New Hampshire section of Northern Pass in September of 2017, we would expect to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval by the end of 2017. Based on that schedule, we should be in the position to construct the project during the 2018 and '19 time frame as indicated on Slide 11. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on Slide 12. On the state regulatory level, we've had a number of developments over the past few months, as you can see on Slide 13. The most important developments occurred in mid-August when Massachusetts Supreme Court -- Judicial Court ruled that under current state law, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cannot approve natural gas transmission contracts signed by electric distribution companies. As a result of that court decision, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies requested that they be allowed to withdraw the contracts between Access Northeast and Eversource's Massachusetts electric utilities and National Grid. That request was accepted by the DPU last month, so there is no contract currently pending before the DPU related to Access Northeast.
In New Hampshire, the PUC ruled on October 6 that under current state law, it does not have the authority to approve natural gas to pass in contracts for electric distribution companies. The ruling reversed a PUC staff finding issued a year ago and was disappointing to us. In its order, the commission cited similar reasoning to the Massachusetts court decision and even cited that decision in the footnote. Requesting reconsideration from the commission would be required before an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court could be considered by Eversource New Hampshire. 
There have also been developments in others states since our late July earnings call. In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Protection, or DEEP, last week canceled the natural gas RFP issued in June, noting developments in other states. It noted that it will continue to monitor the market and activities outside Connecticut and could reinitiate an RFP anytime. 
In Maine, a written order was issued last month affirming the PUC's July 19 vote to endorse a contract with Access Northeast assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast Capacity on June 30.  In September, the Rhode Island PUC placed a stay on the docket and requested an update from National Grid in mid-January. We believe the PUC's action was appropriate, given the uncertainty in Massachusetts. 
Given the current status of the state regulatory proceedings we're reviewing, the changes we may need to make in the projects configuration to serve both EDCs and LDC loads. As a result, we believe the construction is not likely to commence until the spring or summer of 2019, which would represent a 9- to 12-month change from our previous estimate.
One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England during the winter months: the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem since it passes through Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts, the 2 most densely populated parts of the wind wind [ph] and touches 60% of the region's gas-fired power generation. 
Slide 14 shows you the current natural gas supply situation in New England. Pipelines that reach us from the West through New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario currently can deliver up to 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day on cold winter days. However, the region's LDC loads alone can exceed 4 billion cubic feet per day. 
The difference is bridged by vaporizing stored LNG and by plants switching to oil and increasing their carbon output. Exacerbating this issue is the decline of the Eastern Canadian offshore natural gas production, which is likely to continue, further diminishing supplies for natural gas to the region. 
Slide 15 shows what is happening with our regions' generation fleet. New England has more than 15,000 megawatts of generation where natural gas is the primary fuel. Only about 1/3 of that generation is dual fuel. The other 10,000-plus megawatts only burn natural gas, and you can see the -- virtually none of the generation has firm natural gas supplies. 
Our situation will only get worse as Brayton Point, Pilgrim and other nonnatural gas units retire over the course of the next 2.5 years are replaced by gas-burning units. 
ISO New England is calling that situation precarious. We believe there are very real concerns on reliability of  significant additional sources of natural gas can be brought into New England. Earlier, Phil discussed the results of 3  state Clean Energy RFP. The projects selected for contract negotiations in the RFP will add some Class 1 renewable resources, but will do very little to address these natural gas capacity issues, which are most acute during the cold winter months. And reliability is just one issue. You can see the price differential that existed in New England two winters ago on Slide 16. Wholesale power prices were about 3x, [ph] 2x [ph] higher during the winter than they were during the previous summer. Prospective [ph] customers ultimately pay. 
In a normal year, the price differential is about $1 billion. In a cold winter, it's significantly more. Ultimately, we firmly believe that the region's need for additional pipeline capacity to the West and Access Northeast's unique attributes will result in our project moving forward. We and our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid, remain committed to the project and the $1 billion a year in benefits we can bring to New England customers. 
The 2 paths in the Massachusetts that we are -- have identified involve contracting with the states' natural gas distribution companies for capacity and seeking new, enabling legislation. 
Regarding the legislation -- the legislative option, the Massachusetts legislature will reconvene in early 2017, so a new statute similar to laws that didn't pass in recent years in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, could be voted on by mid-2017. At a recent meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, Massachusetts Governor Baker expressed his explicit support for additional natural gas supplies for the state, and we believe there is significant support in the state to increase access of additional gas supplies. But we understand that there would be opposition to such legislation from various stakeholder interest as they were in Connecticut before a similar law was passed there. 
In regards to natural gas distribution company option, I will remind you that Kinder Morgan's Northeast Energy Direct Project had signed several gas capacity contracts, primarily with Massachusetts and New Hampshire gas distribution companies before Kinder canceled the project earlier this year.  We are currently exploring whether Access Northeast can help meet the growing long-term gas needs of these distribution companies. There is no question that both the region's electric and natural gas consumers need the additional pipeline capacity Access Northeast can provide and that citing a project on an existing right of way and an existing LNG storage site is, by far, the most attractive option.

So you've seen cost as high as $0.24, $0.25 a kilowatt hour. Our recent tenders done in Europe and Holland for less than $0.10 per kilowatt hour. So we believe with the economy of scale and the development in places, such as in Asia or China, which is starting to take place now in Taiwan, we'll see a fairly dramatic decrease. 
I think the other thing that you have to remember, too, is that the load centers and the wind wind [ph] are on the shoreline. And if you have offshore wind, it's closer to the load. So, therefore, your transmission costa decline significantly and offshore wind comes on, essentially 10 turbines at a time. It doesn't come on like a traditional generator where you spend 5 years building a 1,000 megawatts and one push of the button, it all comes on. It's -- every 8 megawatts, it comes on.

And then the other one is basically that each developer, which is pretty consistent with what takes place currently in Europe, each developer bids their project and they bid whatever, 400, 600, 800. Whatever the bid is in terms of megawatts, they build their own offshore substations.

Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3 states.
So let's start with the quarter on Slide 4. We earned $265.3 million or $0.83 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $235.9 million or $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our Transmission segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.24 per share in the third quarter last year. The primary driver of the earnings growth is the higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued needed investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. 
I'll summarize some of our key reliability driven transmission projects in a minute.
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2016, which is the same number as the third quarter of 2015. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher depreciation, property taxes and interest costs. 
On the natural gas side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of '16 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of last year. Higher interest and taxes more than offset the benefits of a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and the increased revenues from our natural gas infrastructure tracking mechanisms.
Turning from the third quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $713.1 million or $2.24 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $696.7 million or $2.19 per share in the first 9 months of 2015. 
In our earnings press release, we reiterated both our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and our 2016 earnings projection of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. At this time, we expect to finish 2016 somewhere in the middle of that range.
Transmission earnings totaled to $0.84 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared to earnings of $0.70 per share in the first 9 months of last year. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision on the first complaint against the returns of -- on equity earned by the New England Transmission Owners. 
Our Electric Distribution and Generation segment earned $1.20 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared with earnings of $1.32 per share for the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share total of benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. 
Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulted -- resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution system reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.16 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.18 per share for the same period last year. The milder first quarter weather this year with significantly reduced natural gas sales were partially offset by rate increases at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth.
O&M continues to be a very good story this year as our employees continue to provide excellent reliability for our customers, while also reducing cost. Lower O&M has added $0.07 per share to earnings so far this year if we exclude the $0.05 of benefits we recorded in the first quarter of '15 when we successfully resolved the bad debt dispute in Massachusetts.
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $559 million in the first 9 months of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of about $910 million for the full year.
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. Last month, we announced that we had received approval of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, our  nearly $125 million transmission project in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which we and National Grid are building. 
Today, we've invested $91 million in the approximately $565 million set of Greater Boston Solutions. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019. 
As we've done in past years, we expect to provide you with our 2017 earnings guidance and our full year capital expenditure projections during our year-end earnings call in February. I'll just cover one area now. During our July earnings call, we discussed the impact of a 9-month extension of the state review of Northern Pass on our 2017 capital budget, and we indicated that other projects are being identified to offset about $600 million reduction in projected Northern Pass CapEx in 2017. In July, we noted an additional $200 million in transmission reliability projects, about $200 million of solar projects in Massachusetts and $30 million to $50 million of additional investments in our Natural Gas Distribution segment.
Since then, we've identified about $50 million of additional transmission reliability projects above the original $200 million, and we -- and as we move through our 2017 budget process, that could go higher. 
We'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities as we move through the next few months and give a complete update during our year-end earnings call.
I also want to touch on Capital Expenditures in our Natural Gas Distribution segment. We've invested $180 million in that segment through the first 9 months of 2016, up approximately 35% from the same period last year. This increase primarily represents an acceleration of cast iron and bare steel pipe replacement in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, an increased level of work this year in our LNG facility where we are undertaking a $200 million upgrade and increased expansion activity at Yankee Gas. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6, in recent developments involving the legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On August 8, Governor Baker signed, in Massachusetts, signed an act to promote energy diversity. The bill requires the state to contract for a 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind over the next 11 years in solicitations of at least 400 megawatts a piece. Subsequently, Governor Baker announced that several firms have acquired fairer leases to attractive offshore wind sites that are 25 to 50 miles South of Cape Cod; had also agreed to lease a location in New Bedford, Massachusetts for their staging -- so staging the construction activities. Massachusetts is clearly positioning itself to be a national leader in offshore wind development. 
We look forward to supporting that effort and believe there will be considerable opportunities for Eversource to build transmission over the coming decade to connect that offshore wind to the electric load. 
The Act also calls for Massachusetts electric companies to commence competitive solicitations by April 2017 for nearly 9,500 gigawatt-hours of additional clean energy annually. Again, we look forward to working with our policymakers on helping to provide the transmission links that will bring that clean energy to Massachusetts consumers.
As you are likely aware, the 3 state Clean Energy RFP was conducted this year by Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. That concluded last week with selections focused on small scale renewables and, as a result, neither Northern Pass nor Clean Energy Connect was selected. The state shows only 460 megawatts of Class 1 renewables, about 2/3 of that solar and 1/3 wind. 
Our 2 bids included hydroelectric generation that did not strictly meet the Class 1 criteria in the RFP. We're focusing our efforts on the next round of contracting that is immediately around the corner. That involves solicitations for the nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours, where the Massachusetts legislation explicitly allows large hydroelectric sources to participate. We believe that both Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect would be excellent candidates for these next solicitations due to their potentially significant impact on lowering carbon emissions. 
Northern Pass alone would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.3 million tons a year, the equivalent of taking about 690,000 cars off the road. It may make Massachusetts roads safer, too. I don't know.
Switching from the regulatory slide in Slide 7. Hearings begin tomorrow, actually, on our proposal to build up to 62 megawatts of solar generation in Massachusetts at a cost of about $200 million. Under legislation passed in April of this year, each Massachusetts electric utility is allowed to own and operate up to 35 megawatts of solar. Our Western Mass Electric already has 8 megawatts of solar under a prior authorization, so we can add an additional 27 megawatts. NSTAR Electric has none, so we could build 35 megawatts. A DPU decision is due by the end of this year with construction targeted for completion by the end of next year. 
In New Hampshire, the state approved our -- JPMorgan as the auction adviser for the divestiture of our 1,200 megawatts of regulated generation. JPMorgan has submitted a proposal for conducting the auction, which the New Hampshire Public Utility Public Commission is now considering. That proposal calls for active marketing to take place in early 2017. 
We are targeting the second half of 2017 for completing the divestiture process. You recall that the New Hampshire legislation enables the recovery of all of our plant investment, either through the sale proceeds or through securitization. 
Turning to Slide 8. You can see the current status of the various return on equity complaints before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to transmission investment in New England. The latest development involves the fourth complaint. On September 20, the FERC accepted the complaint and subsequently assigned a settlement judge to the case. If we do not settle, FERC expects that an order in the complaint would be issued in mid-2018. 
We continue to record earnings based on our original October 2014 decision in the first complaint, even though that case remains on appeal before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where oral arguments have been scheduled for December 6. 
We look forward to seeing many of you who are on this call at the EEI Financial Conference. And now, I'll turn it over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our late July earnings call. On October 14, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission issued an order authorizing Northern Pass to do business as a New Hampshire Utility. In reaching its decision, the commission approved a settlement agreement between Northern Pass and the PUC staff that determined that Northern Pass had the technical, managerial and financial expertise to operate as a public utility. The PUC further concluded that, “Rent in Northern Pass Authority to commence business as a public utility is for the public good.”. 
We're pleased to have received this important foundational ruling. In September and October, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, held more than 20 days of hearings or technical sessions on the project, which featured 10 panels of witnesses on topics that included system stability, reliability, project construction and historical resources. The sessions allowed intervenors to question our witnesses on all aspects of the project based on testimony that was submitted as part of the SEC application last fall. We're very pleased with how well these sessions went overall. 
They were an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate the thoughtful planning design and engineering that we have already devoted to this project and to underscore the significant economic and environmental benefits Northern Pass will provide to the region. 
The next key milestone is the submission of intervenor testimony in mid-November. Reports from the said agencies that are reviewing the project are due to the Site Evaluation Committee by March 1, and we anticipate the final committee hearings starting in April of next year. A final written decision is expected by September 30 of 2017. 
If the Committee issues a written order approving the 192-mile New Hampshire section of Northern Pass in September of 2017, we would expect to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval by the end of 2017. Based on that schedule, we should be in the position to construct the project during the 2018 and '19 time frame as indicated on Slide 11. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on Slide 12. On the state regulatory level, we've had a number of developments over the past few months, as you can see on Slide 13. The most important developments occurred in mid-August when Massachusetts Supreme Court -- Judicial Court ruled that under current state law, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cannot approve natural gas transmission contracts signed by electric distribution companies. As a result of that court decision, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies requested that they be allowed to withdraw the contracts between Access Northeast and Eversource's Massachusetts electric utilities and National Grid. That request was accepted by the DPU last month, so there is no contract currently pending before the DPU related to Access Northeast.
In New Hampshire, the PUC ruled on October 6 that under current state law, it does not have the authority to approve natural gas to pass in contracts for electric distribution companies. The ruling reversed a PUC staff finding issued a year ago and was disappointing to us. In its order, the commission cited similar reasoning to the Massachusetts court decision and even cited that decision in the footnote. Requesting reconsideration from the commission would be required before an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court could be considered by Eversource New Hampshire. 
There have also been developments in others states since our late July earnings call. In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Protection, or DEEP, last week canceled the natural gas RFP issued in June, noting developments in other states. It noted that it will continue to monitor the market and activities outside Connecticut and could reinitiate an RFP anytime. 
In Maine, a written order was issued last month affirming the PUC's July 19 vote to endorse a contract with Access Northeast assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast Capacity on June 30.  In September, the Rhode Island PUC placed a stay on the docket and requested an update from National Grid in mid-January. We believe the PUC's action was appropriate, given the uncertainty in Massachusetts. 
Given the current status of the state regulatory proceedings we're reviewing, the changes we may need to make in the projects configuration to serve both EDCs and LDC loads. As a result, we believe the construction is not likely to commence until the spring or summer of 2019, which would represent a 9- to 12-month change from our previous estimate.
One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England during the winter months: the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem since it passes through Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts, the 2 most densely populated parts of the wind wind [ph] and touches 60% of the region's gas-fired power generation. 
Slide 14 shows you the current natural gas supply situation in New England. Pipelines that reach us from the West through New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario currently can deliver up to 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day on cold winter days. However, the region's LDC loads alone can exceed 4 billion cubic feet per day. 
The difference is bridged by vaporizing stored LNG and by plants switching to oil and increasing their carbon output. Exacerbating this issue is the decline of the Eastern Canadian offshore natural gas production, which is likely to continue, further diminishing supplies for natural gas to the region. 
Slide 15 shows what is happening with our regions' generation fleet. New England has more than 15,000 megawatts of generation where natural gas is the primary fuel. Only about 1/3 of that generation is dual fuel. The other 10,000-plus megawatts only burn natural gas, and you can see the -- virtually none of the generation has firm natural gas supplies. 
Our situation will only get worse as Brayton Point, Pilgrim and other nonnatural gas units retire over the course of the next 2.5 years are replaced by gas-burning units. 
ISO New England is calling that situation precarious. We believe there are very real concerns on reliability of  significant additional sources of natural gas can be brought into New England. Earlier, Phil discussed the results of 3  state Clean Energy RFP. The projects selected for contract negotiations in the RFP will add some Class 1 renewable resources, but will do very little to address these natural gas capacity issues, which are most acute during the cold winter months. And reliability is just one issue. You can see the price differential that existed in New England two winters ago on Slide 16. Wholesale power prices were about 3x, [ph] 2x [ph] higher during the winter than they were during the previous summer. Prospective [ph] customers ultimately pay. 
In a normal year, the price differential is about $1 billion. In a cold winter, it's significantly more. Ultimately, we firmly believe that the region's need for additional pipeline capacity to the West and Access Northeast's unique attributes will result in our project moving forward. We and our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid, remain committed to the project and the $1 billion a year in benefits we can bring to New England customers. 
The 2 paths in the Massachusetts that we are -- have identified involve contracting with the states' natural gas distribution companies for capacity and seeking new, enabling legislation. 
Regarding the legislation -- the legislative option, the Massachusetts legislature will reconvene in early 2017, so a new statute similar to laws that didn't pass in recent years in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, could be voted on by mid-2017. At a recent meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, Massachusetts Governor Baker expressed his explicit support for additional natural gas supplies for the state, and we believe there is significant support in the state to increase access of additional gas supplies. But we understand that there would be opposition to such legislation from various stakeholder interest as they were in Connecticut before a similar law was passed there. 
In regards to natural gas distribution company option, I will remind you that Kinder Morgan's Northeast Energy Direct Project had signed several gas capacity contracts, primarily with Massachusetts and New Hampshire gas distribution companies before Kinder canceled the project earlier this year.  We are currently exploring whether Access Northeast can help meet the growing long-term gas needs of these distribution companies. There is no question that both the region's electric and natural gas consumers need the additional pipeline capacity Access Northeast can provide and that citing a project on an existing right of way and an existing LNG storage site is, by far, the most attractive option.

So you've seen cost as high as $0.24, $0.25 a kilowatt hour. Our recent tenders done in Europe and Holland for less than $0.10 per kilowatt hour. So we believe with the economy of scale and the development in places, such as in Asia or China, which is starting to take place now in Taiwan, we'll see a fairly dramatic decrease. 
I think the other thing that you have to remember, too, is that the load centers and the wind wind [ph] are on the shoreline. And if you have offshore wind, it's closer to the load. So, therefore, your transmission costs decline significantly and offshore wind comes on, essentially 10 turbines at a time. It doesn't come on like a traditional generator where you spend 5 years building a 1,000 megawatts and one push of the button, it all comes on. It's -- every 8 megawatts, it comes on.

And then the other one is basically that each developer, which is pretty consistent with what takes place currently in Europe, each developer bids their project and they bid whatever, 400, 600, 800. Whatever the bid is in terms of megawatts, they build their own offshore substations.

Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the 3 states.
So let's start with the quarter on Slide 4. We earned $265.3 million or $0.83 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $235.9 million or $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our Transmission segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.24 per share in the third quarter last year. The primary driver of the earnings growth is the higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued needed investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. 
I'll summarize some of our key reliability driven transmission projects in a minute.
On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2016, which is the same number as the third quarter of 2015. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher depreciation, property taxes and interest costs. 
On the natural gas side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of '16 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of last year. Higher interest and taxes more than offset the benefits of a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and the increased revenues from our natural gas infrastructure tracking mechanisms.
Turning from the third quarter to the year-to-date results. We earned $713.1 million or $2.24 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $696.7 million or $2.19 per share in the first 9 months of 2015. 
In our earnings press release, we reiterated both our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and our 2016 earnings projection of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. At this time, we expect to finish 2016 somewhere in the middle of that range.
Transmission earnings totaled to $0.84 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared to earnings of $0.70 per share in the first 9 months of last year. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision on the first complaint against the returns of -- on equity earned by the New England Transmission Owners. 
Our Electric Distribution and Generation segment earned $1.20 per share in the first 9 months of '16 compared with earnings of $1.32 per share for the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share total of benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric. 
Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulted -- resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution system reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.16 per share in the first 9 months of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.18 per share for the same period last year. The milder first quarter weather this year with significantly reduced natural gas sales were partially offset by rate increases at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth.
O&M continues to be a very good story this year as our employees continue to provide excellent reliability for our customers, while also reducing cost. Lower O&M has added $0.07 per share to earnings so far this year if we exclude the $0.05 of benefits we recorded in the first quarter of '15 when we successfully resolved the bad debt dispute in Massachusetts.
Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $559 million in the first 9 months of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of about $910 million for the full year.
As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our 2 large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions. Last month, we announced that we had received approval of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, our  nearly $125 million transmission project in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which we and National Grid are building. 
Today, we've invested $91 million in the approximately $565 million set of Greater Boston Solutions. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019. 
As we've done in past years, we expect to provide you with our 2017 earnings guidance and our full year capital expenditure projections during our year-end earnings call in February. I'll just cover one area now. During our July earnings call, we discussed the impact of a 9-month extension of the state review of Northern Pass on our 2017 capital budget, and we indicated that other projects are being identified to offset about $600 million reduction in projected Northern Pass CapEx in 2017. In July, we noted an additional $200 million in transmission reliability projects, about $200 million of solar projects in Massachusetts and $30 million to $50 million of additional investments in our Natural Gas Distribution segment.
Since then, we've identified about $50 million of additional transmission reliability projects above the original $200 million, and we -- and as we move through our 2017 budget process, that could go higher. 
We'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities as we move through the next few months and give a complete update during our year-end earnings call.
I also want to touch on Capital Expenditures in our Natural Gas Distribution segment. We've invested $180 million in that segment through the first 9 months of 2016, up approximately 35% from the same period last year. This increase primarily represents an acceleration of cast iron and bare steel pipe replacement in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, an increased level of work this year in our LNG facility where we are undertaking a $200 million upgrade and increased expansion activity at Yankee Gas. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 6, in recent developments involving the legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On August 8, Governor Baker signed, in Massachusetts, signed an act to promote energy diversity. The bill requires the state to contract for a 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind over the next 11 years in solicitations of at least 400 megawatts a piece. Subsequently, Governor Baker announced that several firms have acquired fairer leases to attractive offshore wind sites that are 25 to 50 miles South of Cape Cod; had also agreed to lease a location in New Bedford, Massachusetts for their staging -- so staging the construction activities. Massachusetts is clearly positioning itself to be a national leader in offshore wind development. 
We look forward to supporting that effort and believe there will be considerable opportunities for Eversource to build transmission over the coming decade to connect that offshore wind to the electric load. 
The Act also calls for Massachusetts electric companies to commence competitive solicitations by April 2017 for nearly 9,500 gigawatt-hours of additional clean energy annually. Again, we look forward to working with our policymakers on helping to provide the transmission links that will bring that clean energy to Massachusetts consumers.
As you are likely aware, the 3 state Clean Energy RFP was conducted this year by Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. That concluded last week with selections focused on small scale renewables and, as a result, neither Northern Pass nor Clean Energy Connect was selected. The state shows only 460 megawatts of Class 1 renewables, about 2/3 of that solar and 1/3 wind. 
Our 2 bids included hydroelectric generation that did not strictly meet the Class 1 criteria in the RFP. We're focusing our efforts on the next round of contracting that is immediately around the corner. That involves solicitations for the nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours, where the Massachusetts legislation explicitly allows large hydroelectric sources to participate. We believe that both Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect would be excellent candidates for these next solicitations due to their potentially significant impact on lowering carbon emissions. 
Northern Pass alone would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.3 million tons a year, the equivalent of taking about 690,000 cars off the road. It may make Massachusetts roads safer, too. I don't know.
Switching from the regulatory slide in Slide 7. Hearings begin tomorrow, actually, on our proposal to build up to 62 megawatts of solar generation in Massachusetts at a cost of about $200 million. Under legislation passed in April of this year, each Massachusetts electric utility is allowed to own and operate up to 35 megawatts of solar. Our Western Mass Electric already has 8 megawatts of solar under a prior authorization, so we can add an additional 27 megawatts. NSTAR Electric has none, so we could build 35 megawatts. A DPU decision is due by the end of this year with construction targeted for completion by the end of next year. 
In New Hampshire, the state approved our -- JPMorgan as the auction adviser for the divestiture of our 1,200 megawatts of regulated generation. JPMorgan has submitted a proposal for conducting the auction, which the New Hampshire Public Utility Public Commission is now considering. That proposal calls for active marketing to take place in early 2017. 
We are targeting the second half of 2017 for completing the divestiture process. You recall that the New Hampshire legislation enables the recovery of all of our plant investment, either through the sale proceeds or through securitization. 
Turning to Slide 8. You can see the current status of the various return on equity complaints before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to transmission investment in New England. The latest development involves the fourth complaint. On September 20, the FERC accepted the complaint and subsequently assigned a settlement judge to the case. If we do not settle, FERC expects that an order in the complaint would be issued in mid-2018. 
We continue to record earnings based on our original October 2014 decision in the first complaint, even though that case remains on appeal before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals where oral arguments have been scheduled for December 6. 
We look forward to seeing many of you who are on this call at the EEI Financial Conference. And now, I'll turn it over to Lee."

I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. 
Let's start with Northern Pass in Slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our late July earnings call. On October 14, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission issued an order authorizing Northern Pass to do business as a New Hampshire Utility. In reaching its decision, the commission approved a settlement agreement between Northern Pass and the PUC staff that determined that Northern Pass had the technical, managerial and financial expertise to operate as a public utility. The PUC further concluded that, “Rent in Northern Pass Authority to commence business as a public utility is for the public good.”. 
We're pleased to have received this important foundational ruling. In September and October, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, held more than 20 days of hearings or technical sessions on the project, which featured 10 panels of witnesses on topics that included system stability, reliability, project construction and historical resources. The sessions allowed intervenors to question our witnesses on all aspects of the project based on testimony that was submitted as part of the SEC application last fall. We're very pleased with how well these sessions went overall. 
They were an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate the thoughtful planning design and engineering that we have already devoted to this project and to underscore the significant economic and environmental benefits Northern Pass will provide to the region. 
The next key milestone is the submission of intervenor testimony in mid-November. Reports from the said agencies that are reviewing the project are due to the Site Evaluation Committee by March 1, and we anticipate the final committee hearings starting in April of next year. A final written decision is expected by September 30 of 2017. 
If the Committee issues a written order approving the 192-mile New Hampshire section of Northern Pass in September of 2017, we would expect to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval by the end of 2017. Based on that schedule, we should be in the position to construct the project during the 2018 and '19 time frame as indicated on Slide 11. 
From Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on Slide 12. On the state regulatory level, we've had a number of developments over the past few months, as you can see on Slide 13. The most important developments occurred in mid-August when Massachusetts Supreme Court -- Judicial Court ruled that under current state law, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cannot approve natural gas transmission contracts signed by electric distribution companies. As a result of that court decision, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies requested that they be allowed to withdraw the contracts between Access Northeast and Eversource's Massachusetts electric utilities and National Grid. That request was accepted by the DPU last month, so there is no contract currently pending before the DPU related to Access Northeast.
In New Hampshire, the PUC ruled on October 6 that under current state law, it does not have the authority to approve natural gas to pass in contracts for electric distribution companies. The ruling reversed a PUC staff finding issued a year ago and was disappointing to us. In its order, the commission cited similar reasoning to the Massachusetts court decision and even cited that decision in the footnote. Requesting reconsideration from the commission would be required before an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court could be considered by Eversource New Hampshire. 
There have also been developments in others states since our late July earnings call. In Connecticut, the State Department of Energy and Protection, or DEEP, last week canceled the natural gas RFP issued in June, noting developments in other states. It noted that it will continue to monitor the market and activities outside Connecticut and could reinitiate an RFP anytime. 
In Maine, a written order was issued last month affirming the PUC's July 19 vote to endorse a contract with Access Northeast assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island move ahead as well. 
In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast Capacity on June 30.  In September, the Rhode Island PUC placed a stay on the docket and requested an update from National Grid in mid-January. We believe the PUC's action was appropriate, given the uncertainty in Massachusetts. 
Given the current status of the state regulatory proceedings we're reviewing, the changes we may need to make in the projects configuration to serve both EDCs and LDC loads. As a result, we believe the construction is not likely to commence until the spring or summer of 2019, which would represent a 9- to 12-month change from our previous estimate.
One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England during the winter months: the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem since it passes through Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts, the 2 most densely populated parts of the wind wind [ph] and touches 60% of the region's gas-fired power generation. 
Slide 14 shows you the current natural gas supply situation in New England. Pipelines that reach us from the West through New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario currently can deliver up to 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day on cold winter days. However, the region's LDC loads alone can exceed 4 billion cubic feet per day. 
The difference is bridged by vaporizing stored LNG and by plants switching to oil and increasing their carbon output. Exacerbating this issue is the decline of the Eastern Canadian offshore natural gas production, which is likely to continue, further diminishing supplies for natural gas to the region. 
Slide 15 shows what is happening with our regions' generation fleet. New England has more than 15,000 megawatts of generation where natural gas is the primary fuel. Only about 1/3 of that generation is dual fuel. The other 10,000-plus megawatts only burn natural gas, and you can see the -- virtually none of the generation has firm natural gas supplies. 
Our situation will only get worse as Brayton Point, Pilgrim and other nonnatural gas units retire over the course of the next 2.5 years are replaced by gas-burning units. 
ISO New England is calling that situation precarious. We believe there are very real concerns on reliability of  significant additional sources of natural gas can be brought into New England. Earlier, Phil discussed the results of 3  state Clean Energy RFP. The projects selected for contract negotiations in the RFP will add some Class 1 renewable resources, but will do very little to address these natural gas capacity issues, which are most acute during the cold winter months. And reliability is just one issue. You can see the price differential that existed in New England two winters ago on Slide 16. Wholesale power prices were about 3x, [ph] 2x [ph] higher during the winter than they were during the previous summer. Prospective [ph] customers ultimately pay. 
In a normal year, the price differential is about $1 billion. In a cold winter, it's significantly more. Ultimately, we firmly believe that the region's need for additional pipeline capacity to the West and Access Northeast's unique attributes will result in our project moving forward. We and our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid, remain committed to the project and the $1 billion a year in benefits we can bring to New England customers. 
The 2 paths in the Massachusetts that we are -- have identified involve contracting with the states' natural gas distribution companies for capacity and seeking new, enabling legislation. 
Regarding the legislation -- the legislative option, the Massachusetts legislature will reconvene in early 2017, so a new statute similar to laws that didn't pass in recent years in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, could be voted on by mid-2017. At a recent meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, Massachusetts Governor Baker expressed his explicit support for additional natural gas supplies for the state, and we believe there is significant support in the state to increase access of additional gas supplies. But we understand that there would be opposition to such legislation from various stakeholder interest as they were in Connecticut before a similar law was passed there. 
In regards to natural gas distribution company option, I will remind you that Kinder Morgan's Northeast Energy Direct Project had signed several gas capacity contracts, primarily with Massachusetts and New Hampshire gas distribution companies before Kinder canceled the project earlier this year.  We are currently exploring whether Access Northeast can help meet the growing long-term gas needs of these distribution companies. There is no question that both the region's electric and natural gas consumers need the additional pipeline capacity Access Northeast can provide and that citing a project on an existing right of way and an existing LNG storage site is, by far, the most attractive option.

So you've seen cost as high as $0.24, $0.25 a kilowatt hour. Our recent tenders done in Europe and Holland for less than $0.10 per kilowatt hour. So we believe with the economy of scale and the development in places, such as in Asia or China, which is starting to take place now in Taiwan, we'll see a fairly dramatic decrease. 
I think the other thing that you have to remember, too, is that the load centers and the wind wind [ph] are on the shoreline. And if you have offshore wind, it's closer to the load. So, therefore, your transmission costs decline significantly and offshore wind comes on, essentially 10 turbines at a time. It doesn't come on like a traditional generator where you spend 5 years building a 1,000 megawatts and one push of the button, it all comes on. It's -- every 8 megawatts, it comes on.

And then the other one is basically that each developer, which is pretty consistent with what takes place currently in Europe, each developer bids their project and they bid whatever, 400, 600, 800. Whatever the bid is in terms of megawatts, they build their own offshore substations. And they build the cables that run into the mainland and interconnect into the existing transmission system, which really means all it would be onshore would be a substation in an  interconnection to the 345kV grid.

And so, therefore, they are being built out to correct that. Most of the -- a future liability -- a future transmission, rather, that will be needed in the region will not be reliability based. It will be needed to connect renewables from a source, whether that's offshore in Canada or another New England, such as Maine, to get those -- to get that renewable energy into the load. So its nature will be less around what we've done over the last 10 years and more around interconnecting renewables to get it to the load."

Just in terms of the specific items, I know you're talking about additional and future items, but there's still several ongoing reliability projects that we have, that we having specific spend on through the next several years in terms of Greater Hartford or Greater Boston and projects in New Hampshire, which may need some additional transmission in New Hampshire more than they have had in recent years. So there's good amounts in the pipeline. And as Lee said, that -- the nature of some of that going forward could change, but the pipeline is robust at this stage."
