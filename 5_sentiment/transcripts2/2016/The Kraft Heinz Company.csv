Before we review our results and talk about the year ahead, I want to provide context to today's conversation by reviewing our goals and strategy. As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on 3 o",482,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our results and talk about the year ahead, I want to provide context to today's conversation by reviewing our goals and strategy. As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on 3 objectives: Profitable sales growth; achieving and maintaining best-in-class margin; and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This is our multiyear plan on 1 page, and it's important to understand that not everything starts to deliver at once. In some cases, like revenue management, it's not a project internal capabilities before we can achieve sustainable results and return. 
So with that as a background, let's turn to Slide 3 to talk about where are we on our journey. Overall, 2015 was a significant accomplish for Kraft Heinz. We came together as one global organization and begun building on the rich history of our dynamic company. The integration team executed an extensive action plan with 2 main objectives: One, operating as one company with one set of goals and business objective; and two, achieving solid alignment on the 2016 budget, viewed from the bottom up by countries and field teams. In many ways, we are pleased with what did not happen in 2015, namely, businesses disruption. We made difficult but necessary decisions around organization restructure that will improve our efficiency, making Kraft Heinz more competitive and accelerating our investment in our brand, products and people. We have already made solid investment in our people, promoting more than 2,400 team members worldwide and introducing a new long-term incentive program that gives many employees the opportunity to increase their ownership in the company. 
In short, our mission, values and process are building the future of ownership and empowerment necessary for the long-term achievements of our company. 
We have also made significant investment in our world-class brand. We're successfully innovations like Lunchables, P3, Heinz Yellow Mustard, sauces in Europe and mayo in Brazil. And we continue to support strong levels of investment in R&D to carry forward Big Bet in 2016 and 2017. 
Finally, we made meaningful progress across our global operations. We significantly improved our tasty rate in United States, in Europe to over 97%. Our best performance in both the legacy Heinz and legacy Kraft business in quite a while. We delivered solid EBITDA and margin gains based on savings from manufacturing footprint efficiencies and improved product mix. And we achieved strong performance in the U.S. cheese and mix business, effectively managing pricing net of commodities cost. This lead to the establish of a solid financial base for the new Kraft Heinz Company that we believe can grow strongly and sustainably. 
Before I go to our agenda for 2016, I'm going to ask George and Paulo to talk about how we landed 2015 and provide a deeper update on the overall status of our key business. George?"
278212,323693560,941341,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. And that's despite a sizable step",561,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. And that's despite a sizable step-down in volume/mix performance in Q4. 
So why am I optimistic? Several reasons. First, regarding profitable net sales was significantly lower promotional activity versus Q4 2014. As you can see on the slide, we drove solid 1.2% non-promoted consumption in Q4 and 1.5% non-promoted consumption for the full year for our combined portfolio in the United States. This was driven by innovation, new product news and increased and working media behind ketchup, pasta sauces, Lunchables, P3, cold cuts, single-served coffee and cream cheese. 
Secondly, our shipments were below consumption in the fourth quarter. This was due to shipment timing versus prior periods and mainly related to comparisons with Q4 last year when, for instance, we were filling the retail pipeline ahead of our launch of Metacafe as well as the business losses in the foodservice highlighted on our last call. But this is now behind us, and we are pursuing a solid development plan for our foodservice business in 2016. 
Third, is the fact that our integration initiatives are beginning to have an impact with organizational structure savings contributing to EBITDA growth in Q4. And looking forward, savings from ZBB should begin to be realized across our combined operation, and modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint should ramp up significantly.
Finally, I am also confident about our prospects because of our robust innovation pipeline. Big Bet and my belief that we are well positioned to build on our 2015 accomplishments in 2016. In particular, we'll become even more equipped and more focused on putting product and investable marketing ideas into the marketplace against some of our biggest turnaround opportunities. I'm not going to tell you that we have a solution for every part of our portfolio just yet. But I do believe our pipeline is in better shape to commercialize trend-bending product into the marketplace. And we will be in even better shape as we execute our footprint initiative over the next 2 years. 
Let me give you a few and quick examples of what to look for on your next round of store check. Capri Sun organic is now in the marketplace with advertising scheduled to hit later in the second quarter. We're making changes to ensure that Mac & Cheese is more relevant today than ever before with no artificial flavors, preservatives or synthetic colors. And you will hear us making noise about this very soon. 
Also, we are working to improve our nutritional frozen meat offering, which we will talk about later in the year. We will support these and other Big Bet with a solid increase in working media follows. I hope you'll also meet the ketchup's campaign that we kicked off during the Super Bowl. It is part of an Asian marketing campaign behind Heinz Ketchup. 
We expect 2016 will be a strong marketing year for us, including further shift of our advertising spend from nonworking to working media with our goal of increasing working media to at least 3/4 of our marketing budget. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,323693560,941341,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015. One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was the strong",1544,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015. One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was the strong negative currency translation, an impact of that group to the 6% range on the top line and 9% to 10% of EBITDA beginning in the third quarter when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And we expect this to continue through the first half of 2016. 
Net pricing was neutral to favorable in all segments in both Q4 for the full year. This was driven by a combination of price increases and taking out inefficient rate spending, partially offset by lower net pricing related to lower net commodity costs across our big 4 commodities in the U.S. and Canada. And with dairy prices remaining low, this is something we are likely to see continue into the first half of 2016. We had negative volume/mix in the U.S., Canada and Europe that offset strong growth in Rest of World. The volume/mix decline accelerated in Q4, but mainly due to factors not expected to repeat. And I'll talk more about those with our segment result. 
As the EBITDA line, we delivered strong growth in Q4 and the full year, driven by restructuring and integration savings, expanding our adjusted EBIT margin by more than 200 basis points for the full year. 
Dropping down to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.62. This benefit by approximately $0.03 from the 53rd week. But this was more than offset by roughly $0.10 from [indiscernible] this year we incurred tax expenses related to the repatriation of foreign earnings done as part of our legal restructuring integration process. This pushed our Q4 tax rate into the mid-30s and for the full year to just over 30%. 
By contrast, in 2014, we had favorable tax impact that drove implied tax rate on adjusted EPS into the mid-20% range for both Q4 and full year. That being said, we continue to believe that an effective tax rate of approximately 30% is fairly representative of our average rate on an ongoing basis. That's the total company. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 in our U.S. segment results. You can see here that we had sequentially weaker organic net sales growth in Q4. This was due to weaker overall volume/mix. The primary sources of the volume/mix decline were consistent with what we've seen all year. trends and volume loss associated with higher net pricing in ready-to-drink beverage, bottled beverage and boxed dinners. Category and market share declines in nutritional frozen meals and lower foodservice shipments due to lost bids at some key customers. 
In Q4, while there are 2 other factors resulted in unfavorable comparison and a further year-on-year decline in volume/mix. One, shipment timing, meaningfully impacted by the pipeline shipments for the launch of Metcafe last year; and two, we executed significant promotional activity in Q4 2014, particularly in parts of our cheese and spendable portfolios that we chose not to repeat this year. 
Looking forward, we don't expect either of these factors to hold back our Q1 volume/mix performance. By contrast, growth in pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. accelerated in Q4 as did adjusted EBITDA margin on both year-over-year basis and sequentially versus Q3. Consistent with the full year, the U.S. benefited from a combination of favorable pricing net of cost and lower overhead. 
In Q4, our adjusted EBITDA growth and margin speaks up momentum from a combination of increased integration savings and better overhead cost performance as the unfavorable bonus accrual comparisons we faced in Q3 faded. 
In Canada, on Slide 7, our results continue to reflect a double-digit currency translation headwind that grew as the year progressed as well as challenges to increase prices step higher input costs in local currency terms. Our price realization improved in Q4 relative to full year. However, volume/mix declined net sales growth into negative territory. For the year, this was mainly caused by lower shipments in foodservice, refreshment beverage and infant nutrition. 
In the fourth quarter, the decline in volume/mix was greater, primarily due to comparisons with prior year in foodservice and coffee, including last year's launch-related shipments of Metcafe. Adjusted EBITDA in Canada was relatively flat for the year, but up mid-single digits in Q4. This reflected the fact that our price realization had got up to higher local input cost. That being said, our Canadian business is facing further local cost inflation in many categories. And this month, we are implementing additional pricing actions to offset the higher cost.
Turning to Europe on Slide 8. While currency translation remain unfavorable, it was slightly less of a drag on our reported results in Q4 than what we had seen most of the year. Beyond currency, the drivers in Europe remain largely the same in Q4 as it had been year-to-date. Net pricing gains from statistic price in ketchup and mayonnaise across a number of markets offset by lower volume/mix. In terms of volume/mix, despite the significant improvement in our product mix, volume/mix was down in the mid-single digit for both the year and Q4. This was primarily driven by volume declines related to cutting efficient promotional activities in U.K. beans, price increase in ketchup and ongoing consumption declines in Italy infant nutrition. In addition, we experienced lower U.K. soup shipments in Q4 due to a combination of 3 factors: One, our on efforts to reduce low return promotional frequency; two, factors moving to increase price based competitive activity to gain market share; and three, all these happening during a seasonably warm weather at the start of the soup season. While the scenario will likely remain challenging for us in Q1, we are now putting in place plans to drive better soup consumption and defend market share. 
In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings combined to deliver double-digit currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the year. And we did this while significantly increasing working media during the year. So overall, we feel good about the health of our European business, and we will continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward.
Finally, is Rest of World on Slide 9. Here, negative currency translation remain at elevated level in Q4. Roughly 33% of net sales and 66% at EBITDA, consistent with the increased impact we saw in Q3 when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. At its current exchange rate this is likely to continue during the first part of 2016. 
Organic net sales grew more than 9% in both Q4 and the full year, with volume/mix again getting stronger as the year progress. Over the year, volume/mix was driven by strength in ketchup, fundamental sauces across all region. And these gains more than offset declines in our nutritional beverage in England. 
In the fourth quarter, better consumption trends in both Asia and Latin America drove increased volume/mix growth. Net EBITDA, we posted strong constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of both Q4 and the full year, driven by volume gains, mix improvements as well as cost savings from ZBB and manufacturing footprint efficiencies. 
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on both synergies and capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 10. Overall, we remain on track in each of the 3 areas of our integration program: Organizational structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. In 2015, we incurred $829 million of costs, with roughly 2/3 of those costs related to service and employee benefit. And we spent only about $225 million in CapEx related to the program. Our estimate of the total cost to achieve our targeted savings remains the same. $1.9 billion of pretax cost, consistent of approximately $1.1 billion of cash cost and roughly $800 million in noncash expenses, like assets by cost and accelerated depreciation. And roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization. I would also note that in 2016, we expect capital expenditures to ramp up considerably as we begin to roll out the bulk of our footprint initiatives. As a result, the majority of the cost to achieve our program will be spent in 2016. 
As far as savings, we realized roughly $125 million of savings in 2015. And we continue to target and remain confident in our ability to deliver aggressive cost savings of $1.5 billion net of inflation by 2017.
Turning to Slide 11. I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share today. In addition, we ended 2016 at just over 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, including preferred stock and are confident we can deliver against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term. An important step in that process will be refinance our preferred stock when it becomes callable in June. And at current interest rate, this would be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective for the company. 
I will now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our prepared remarks."

Similar to what you saw in 2015, we expect currency and consumption trends to remain meaningful headwinds across most market in the year. And as Paulo told you, our general managers from Canada to Asia will continue to face pressure to increase prices in many categories to offset higher input costs in local currency. There is also the ongoing need to drive better consumption in the face of both consumer weakness and consumer desire for fresher, less processed food. 
All of that said, we're very excited about how Kraft Heinz is positioned. To unleash growth, we continue to focus on innovation, go-to-market capabilities and increasing working media dollars. We will build our innovation pipeline to Big Bet in each market. And as the year unfolds, we see us launch advanced where consumers are migrating. Importantly, we will continue to take a portfolio approach within the key categories in which we compete from premium to value offering to meet consumers demand across the spectrum. 
On the cost side, we expect to make significant progress on delivering best-in-class margin through: One, delivery ZBB savings; two, making progress on our manufacturing footprint initiative; and finally, building a real performance-driven culture in Kraft Heinz. 
It's still early, and that will evolve, I will continue to share plans. Overall, this is an exciting and challenging times for the Kraft Heinz family. In 2015, we took steps to build a solid base for sustainable growth. We are executing a strong pipeline of initiatives in 2016 and our synergy plans are laid out throughout 2017, which we will create an even bigger opportunity to invest in our people, our brand and our product.

And we believe the strength of our brand equities and the investments that we have been making and we continue to make in these brands is allowing us to do that. Do we feel this is sustainable? Yes, we do. And the reason we feel it's sustainable is because while we were doing this and the PNOC is being healthy and positive for us, if you look at the market share, which you have access to, we managed to grow share in all these categories. For example, we grew share in cream cheese. We grew share in sauces. We grew share in American slices. We grew share in Oscar Mayer combos. We grew share in macaroni and cheese. We grew share in coffee. Dairy is where we lost some share softening in natural cheese and hotdogs, and it was willing not to chase the market down. So that's if you want the reasons why we believe what we did is sustainable and without strong brands, we won't be able to do that. That's the first part.

And what we have been seeing from experience in '16, George mentioned some of them and so on, that really has been paying out. Look at the performance of Heinz Yellow Mustard. Look at P3 and look at hot sauces in Europe. And there are others coming to market in 2016. What's fair to say, to your question, that you're going to be much more robust on the testing, design, understanding consumers and really coming big and supportive to make it a win in the marketplace. If you say that a more risky strategy that a fragmented innovation pipeline, you're probably right.

I think when you see the fourth [ph] quarter experience more challenge environment in the market in Europe. And that's pretty much it really soup segment in U.K. what you want to really lower level promotion, and we experienced some problem in the distribution with some of our retailer partners in U.K. and the fact that the infant category in Italy will have a stable and growing market share but continue to decline at a fast pace. When you think about reacting to that and we're already seeing that reaction, it's not really only infusing more trade that's your question, but actually getting the right level of promotion with the positive returns in being with the right mechanisms of trade something George just mentioned the question before. So we can have a win-win situation. We tell our partners in U.K. and Europe. And I think there is a solid trend in place to really push Italy to a different level in 2016. So it is true that we experienced more challenge than we faced in the fourth [ph] quarter in Europe, especially in the U.K. situation I mentioned. It's also true that you continue to grow market share in that market except for soup. So what we're seeing in the first quarter and especially moving forward from here is the fact that we're investing more, but we're investing in the right instruments with positive return. On the second part of your question about the lessons from Heinz. And so like I said before, I think a lot of the agenda in Heinz that we push innovation, build market capabilities, higher media spend and so on. It took us almost a year. When we start to push this agenda because I think now, given some knowledge we had before, the integration going well and other elements of the Kraft Heinz merger make us push this agenda in a faster pace. So and there are some lessons from instruments where we went to initiatives and other things SKU rationalization and footprint initiatives. And so that we learned the lessons to be applied here. I'm sure you're going to learn other lessons in this merger that we will be apply at some point in time. But that being said, I believe we're doing things different in some cases and repeating also things that we believe had done well in the past."

Besides that, when you compare -- so again, the promotion exhibit, the selection of the right promotions also helped with the margin increase there. When you compare Europe with other countries, I think each country and the footprint of categories that we have the geographies and the brands that we have in different countries that is not allow us to kind of try to the same type of opportunity margin that we saw in Europe in other places. I think in Europe to date, we are in a stage that we are going to get a much more from sales growth than for margin increase in EBITDA."

Overall, because of our size and the diverse businesses and categories we operate in, we will probably reflect what would go on in the marketplace. The focus on growing volume for us would be largely done through the following: One is renovating our product range. You have seen a lot of activity in this area and making, reformulating product to reflect the consumer trend. The second one we innovating and we're accelerating the growth of innovation, both in center stores to bring back the traffic to that part of the stores and where we have 2 large businesses achieved dairy and the refrigerated meat businesses. And now that the foodservice business have a very strong white space program what I mean, by that white space program is when we emerge the 2 food services business unit, we saw that legacy businesses were not overlapping a lot.

Before we review our results and talk about the year ahead, I want to provide context to today's conversation by reviewing our goals and strategy. As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on 3 o",497,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our results and talk about the year ahead, I want to provide context to today's conversation by reviewing our goals and strategy. As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on 3 objectives: profitable sales growth, achieving and maintaining best-in-class margins and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This is our multiyear plan on the one page, and it's important to understand that not everything starts to deliver at once. In some cases, like revenue management, it's not a project. We must build an internal capability before we can achieve sustainable results and return.
So with that as a background, let's turn to Slide 3 to talk about where are we on our journey. Overall, 2015 was a year of significant accomplish for Kraft Heinz. We came together as one global organization and began building on the rich history of our dynamic company. The integration team executed an extensive action plan with 2 main objectives: One, operating as one company with one set of goals and business objectives; and two, achieving solid alignment on the 2016 budget, built from the bottom up by countries and field teams. In many ways, we are pleased with what did not happen in 2015, namely businesses disruption. We made difficult but necessary decisions around organization restructure that will improve our efficiency, making Kraft Heinz more competitive and accelerating our investment in our brand, products and people. We have already made solid investment in our people, promoting more than 2,400 team members worldwide and introducing a new long-term incentive program that gives many employees the opportunity to increase their ownership in the company.
In short, our vision, values and process are building the culture of ownership and empowerment necessary for the long-term achievements of our company.
We have also made significant investment in our world-class brands. We were successful with Big Bets and innovations like Lunchables, P3, Heinz Yellow Mustard, sauces in Europe and mayo in Brazil. And we continue to support strong levels of investment in R&D to carry forward Big Bets in 2016 and 2017.
Finally, we've made meaningful progress across our global operations. We significantly improved our case [ph] rate in United States and Europe to over 97%, our best performance in both the legacy Heinz and legacy Kraft business in quite a while. We delivered solid EBITDA and margin gains based on savings from manufacturing footprint efficiencies and improved product mix. And we achieved strong performance in the U.S. cheese and meat business, effectively managing pricing, net of commodity costs. This led to the established -- of a solid financial base for the new Kraft Heinz Company that we believe can grow strongly and sustainably.
Before I go to our agenda for 2016, I'm going to ask George and Paulo to talk about how we [ph] in 2015 and provide a deeper update on the overall status of our key business. George?"

Turning to Slide 4. I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond, and that's despite a sizable step",567,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond, and that's despite a sizable step-down in volume and mix performance in Q4.
So why am I optimistic? Several reasons. First, we're driving profitable net sales with significantly lower promotional activity versus Q4 2014. As you can see on the slide, we drove solid 1.2% non-promoted consumption in Q4 and 1.5% non-promoted consumption for the full year for our combined portfolio in the United States. This was driven by innovation, new product news and increased and working media behind ketchup, pasta sauces, Lunchables, P3, cold cuts, single-serve coffee and cream cheese.
Secondly, our shipments were below consumption in the fourth quarter. This was due to shipment timing versus prior periods and mainly related to comparisons with Q4 last year when, for instance, we were filling the retail pipeline ahead of our launch of McCafé as well as the business losses in the Foodservice highlighted on our last call. But this is now behind us, and we are pursuing a solid development plan for our Foodservice business in 2016.
Third is the fact that our integration initiatives are beginning to have an impact with organizational structure savings contributing to EBITDA growth in Q4. And looking forward, savings from ZBB should begin to be realized across our combined operations, and modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint should ramp up significantly.
Finally, I am also confident about our prospects because of our robust innovation pipeline, Big Bets and my belief that we are well positioned to build on our 2015 accomplishments in 2016. In particular, we'll become even more equipped and more focused on putting product and investable marketing ideas into the marketplace against some of our biggest turnaround opportunities. I'm not going to tell you that we have a solution for every part of our portfolio just yet. But I do believe our pipeline is in better shape to commercialize trend-bending products into the marketplace. And we will be in even better shape as we execute our footprint initiative over the next 2 years.
Let me give you a few and quick examples of what to look for on your next round of store checks. Capri Sun Organic is now in the marketplace with advertising scheduled to hit later in the second quarter. We're making changes to ensure that Mac & Cheese is more relevant today than ever before with no artificial flavors, preservatives or synthetic colors. And you will hear us making noise about this very soon. Also, we are working to improve our nutritional frozen meal offering, which we will talk about later in the year.
We will support these and other Big Bets with a solid increase in working media dollars. I hope you all saw our Meet the Ketchups campaign that we kicked off during the Super Bowl. It is part of a major marketing campaign behind Heinz Ketchup.
We expect 2016 will be a strong marketing year for us, including a further shift of our advertising spend from nonworking to working media with our goal of increasing working media to at least 3/4 of our marketing budget. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,323693560,941655,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015. One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was the strong",1553,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015. One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was the strong negative currency translation, an impact that grew to the 6% range on the top line and 9% to 10% of EBITDA beginning in the third quarter when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And we expect this to continue through the first half of 2016.
Net pricing was 0.2 to favorable in all segments in both Q4 and the full year. This was driven by a combination of price increases and taking out inefficient rate spending, partially offset by lower net pricing related to lower net commodity costs across our big 4 commodities in the U.S. and Canada. And with dairy prices remaining low, this is something we are likely to see continue into the first half of 2016. We had negative volume/mix in the U.S., Canada and Europe that offset strong growth in Rest of World. The volume/mix decline accelerated in Q4 but mainly due to factors not expected to repeat, and I'll talk more about those with our segment results.
At the EBITDA line, we delivered strong growth in Q4 and the full year, driven by restructuring and integration savings, expanding our adjusted EBIT margin by more than 200 basis points for the full year.
Dropping down to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.62 did benefit by approximately $0.03 from the 53rd week. But this was more than offset by roughly $0.10 from 
[Audio Gap]
So far this year, we incurred tax expenses related to the repatriation of foreign earnings done as part of our legal restructuring integration process. This pushed our Q4 implied tax rate into the mid-30s and for the full year to just over 30%.
By contrast, in 2014, we had favorable tax impact that drove implied tax rates on adjusted EPS into the mid-20% range for both Q4 and full year. That being said, we continue to believe that an effective tax rate of approximately 30% is fairly representative of our average rate on an ongoing basis. That's the total company.
Let's turn to Slide 6 in our U.S. segment results. You can see here that we had sequentially weaker organic net sales growth in Q4. This was due to weaker overall volume/mix. The primary sources of the volume/mix decline were consistent with what we've seen all year: category trends and volume loss associated with higher net pricing in ready-to-drink beverage, powdered beverage and boxed dinners; category and market share declines in nutritional frozen meals; and lower Foodservice shipments due to lost bids at some key customers.
In Q4, there are 2 other factors resulted in unfavorable comparison and a further year-on-year decline in volume/mix: one, shipment timing, meaningfully impacted by the pipeline shipments for the launch of McCafé last year; and two, we executed significant promotional activity in Q4 2014, particularly in parts of our cheese and spoonable portfolios that we chose not to repeat this year. 
Looking forward, we don't expect either of these factors to hold back our Q1 volume/mix performance. By contrast, growth in pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. accelerated in Q4 as did adjusted EBITDA margin on both year-over-year basis and sequentially versus Q3. Consistent with the full year, the U.S. benefited from a combination of favorable pricing net of cost and lower overhead.
In Q4, our adjusted EBITDA growth and margins picked up momentum from a combination of increased integration savings and better overhead cost performance, as the unfavorable bonus accrual comparisons we faced in Q3 faded.
In Canada, on Slide 7, our results continue to reflect a double-digit currency translation headwind that grew as the year progressed as well as challenges to increase prices to offset higher input costs in local currency terms. Our price realization improved in Q4 relative to full year. However, volume/mix declined global organic net sales growth into negative territory. For the year, this was mainly caused by lower shipments in Foodservice, refreshment beverage and infant nutrition. 
In the fourth quarter, the decline in volume/mix was greater, primarily due to comparisons with prior year in Foodservice and coffee, including last year's launch-related shipments of McCafé. Adjusted EBITDA in Canada was relatively flat for the year but up mid-single digits in Q4. This reflected the fact that our price realization had caught up to higher local input costs. That being said, our Canadian business is facing further local cost inflation in many categories. And this month, we are implementing additional pricing actions to offset the higher cost.
Turning to Europe on Slide 8. While currency translation remained unfavorable, it was slightly less of a drag on our reported results in Q4 than what we had seen most of the year. Beyond currency, the drivers in Europe remained largely the same in Q4 as it had been year-to-date. Net pricing gains from strategic pricing in ketchup and mayonnaise across a number of markets offset by lower volume/mix. In terms of volume/mix, despite the significant improvement in our product mix, volume/mix was down in the mid-single digits for both the year and Q4. This was primarily driven by volume declines related to cutting inefficient promotional activities in U.K. beans, price increase in ketchup and ongoing consumption declines in Italy infant nutrition.
In addition, we experienced lower U.K. soup shipments in Q4 due to a combination of 3 factors: one, our own efforts to reduce low-return promotional frequency; two, competitors moving to increase price based on competitive activity to gain market share; and three, all these happening during a seasonably warm weather at the start of the soup season. While this scenario will likely remain challenging for us in Q1, we are now putting in place plans to drive better soup consumption and defend market share.
In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver double-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the year. And we did this while significantly increasing working media during the year.
So overall, we feel good about the health of our European business, and we will continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward.
Finally is Rest of World on Slide 9. Here, negative currency translation remained at elevated level in Q4, roughly 33% of net sales and 56% at EBITDA, consistent with the increased impact we saw in Q3 when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And at the current exchange rates, this is likely to continue during the first part of 2016. 
Organic net sales grew more than 9% in both Q4 and the full year, with volume/mix gains getting stronger as the year progress. For the year, volume/mix growth was driven by strength in ketchup, condiments and sauces across all regions. And these gains more than offset declines in our COMPLAN nutritional beverage in India. 
In the fourth quarter, better consumption trends in both Asia and Latin America drove increased volume/mix growth. At EBITDA, we posted strong constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the full year, driven by volume gains, mix improvements as well as cost savings from ZBB and manufacturing footprint efficiencies.
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on both synergies and capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 10. Overall, we remain on track in each of the 3 areas of our integration program: organizational structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. In 2015, we incurred $829 million of costs, with roughly 2/3 of those costs related to severance and employee benefit and we spent only about $225 million in CapEx related to the program.
Our estimate of the total cost to achieve our targeted savings remains the same: $1.9 billion of pretax cost, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of cash cost and roughly $800 million in noncash expenses like assets write-offs and accelerated depreciation; and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization. I would also note that in 2016, we expect capital expenditures to ramp up considerably as we begin to roll out the bulk of our footprint initiatives. As a result, the majority of the cost to achieve our program will be spent in 2016.
As far as savings, we realized roughly $125 million of savings in 2015. And we continue to target and remain confident in our ability to deliver aggressive cost savings of $1.5 billion net of inflation by 2017.
Turning to Slide 11. I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share today. In addition, we ended 2015 at just over 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, including preferred stock and are confident we can deliver against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term.
An important step in that process will be refinance our preferred stock when it becomes callable in June. And at current interest rate, this would be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective for the company. 
I'll now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our prepared remarks."

Similar to what you saw in 2015, we expect currency and consumption trends to remain meaningful headwinds across most market in the year. And as Paulo told you, our general managers from Canada to Asia will continue to face pressure to increase prices in many categories to offset higher input costs in local currency. There is also the ongoing need to drive better consumption in the face of both consumer weakness and consumer desire for fresher, less processed food.
All of that said, we're very excited about how Kraft Heinz is positioned. To unleash growth, we will continue to focus on innovation, go-to-market capabilities and increasing working media dollars. We will build our innovation pipeline through Big Bets in each market. And as the year unfolds, we'll see us launch advanced in areas where consumers are migrating. Importantly, we will continue to take a portfolio approach within the key categories in which we compete, from premium to value offering to meet consumers' demand across the spectrum.
On the cost side, we expect to make significant progress on delivering best-in-class margin through: one, delivering ZBB savings; two, making progress on our manufacturing footprint initiative; and finally, building a real performance-driven culture in Kraft Heinz.
It's still early. And as we evolve, I will continue to share our plans. Overall, this is an exciting and challenging times for the Kraft Heinz family. In 2015, we took steps to build a solid base for sustainable growth. We are executing a strong pipeline of initiatives in 2016 and our synergy plans are laid out throughout 2017, which will create an even bigger opportunity to invest in our people, our brands and our products.

I think it's important as we highlight in the remarks to go to the specific items of the fourth quarter, right? Paulo already went from all the regions on the specifics. And there were some challenged categories, like frozen meals or soup in U.K. But when you see our market share performance and so on, they have been growing quite stable in both part of that. So most part of what you're seeing, we saw a lot of really leaving negative ROI initiatives that really didn't support the company for the long run, as we continue to build the pillars and push us to really a profitable sales agenda. As I always said and it's important to remind we're a sales organization. And with that in mind, what I can tell you that I think from the Heinz comparison you made in the beginning, and so I think there are a lot of difference in a positive way. First, we are pushing this agenda of innovation of go-to-market capabilities and higher marketing dollars in a much faster pace than we did at that time, okay? And second, we're actually feeling good about the first quarter of the year and our objectives for 2016 and beyond on pushing this agenda."

Yes, we are very pleased with the work we did on PNOC and not just in Q4 or the last 2 quarters that you have mentioned but right throughout 2015, particularly in dairy, in meat, in coffee. And we believe the strength of our brand equities and the investments that we have been making and we continue to make in these brands is allowing us to do that. Do we feel this is sustainable? Yes, we do. And the reason we feel it's sustainable is because while we were doing this and the PNOC is being healthy and positive for us, if you look at the market share, which you have access to, we managed to grow share in all these categories. For example, we grew share in cream cheese. We grew share in sauces. We grew share in American slices. We grew share in Oscar Mayer with combos [ph]. We grew share in Smart Ones and [indiscernible]. We grew share in coffee. Dairy is where we lost some share, softening in nacho cheese and hotdogs. And it was our willingness not to chase the market down. So that's if you want the reasons why we believe what we did is sustainable. And without strong brands, we won't be able to do that. That's the first part. The second part of your question, we are now of a size where we believe that assessing our market -- go-to-market model and sales by focusing on our capability to cover more areas and be more extensive, and the frequency, of course, would be higher, would allow us to do more. So we are experimenting with some models that we'll be in a better position to share with you later on in the year."

In a sense what we try to do with the Big Bets not only here in the United States but Canada, Europe and all, we're going to fuel [ph] that but really bolder and stronger in that sense. So in order to get there and mitigate the risk, we need really to pass the profile and the pipeline from consumer insights up to the shelf as a program in a much more effective way. And what we have been seeing from the experience in '15, George mentioned some of them and so on, that really has been paying out. Look at the performance of Heinz Yellow Mustard, you look at P3 and look at hot sauces in Europe. And there are others coming to market in 2016. What's fair to say, to your question, that we're going to need to be much more robust on the testing, design, understanding consumers and really coming big and supportive  2to make it a win in the marketplace. If you say that's a more risky strategy than a fragmented innovation pipeline, you're probably right.

Let me comment on the European part of your question then we'll go to the lessons. I think when we see the fourth quarter, it's true, the experience is a little more challenged environment in the market in Europe. And that's pretty much a push by really the soup segment in U.K. We went to really lower-level promotion and we experienced some problem in the distribution with some of our retailer partners in U.K. And the fact that the infant category in Italy, while we have a stable and growing market share, but continue to decline at a fast pace. When we think about reacting to that and we're already seeing that reaction, it's not really only infusing more trade to your question, but actually getting the right level of promotion with the positive returns and with the right mechanism of trade, something George just mentioned, the question before. So we can have a win-win situation. We tell our partners in U.K. and Europe. And I think there is a solid trend in place to really push Italy to a different level in 2016. So it's true that we experience more challenge than we faced in the fourth quarter in Europe, especially the U.K. situation I mentioned. It's also true that we continue to grow market share in that market except for soup. So what I'm seeing now in the first quarter and especially moving forward from here is the fact that we're investing more, but we're investing in the right instruments with positive return. On the second part of your question about the lessons from Heinz. And so like I said before, I think a lot of the agendas in Heinz that we push innovation, evolve from market capabilities, higher media spend and so on, it took us almost a year when we started to push this agenda. I think now, given some knowledge we had before, the integration going well and a lot of other elements of the Kraft Heinz merger make us push this agenda in a faster pace. So -- and there are some lessons from instruments, the way we went through the revenue management initiatives and other things with SKU rationalization and footprint initiatives and so that we learned the lessons to be applied here. I'm sure we're going to learn other lessons in this merger that we will be applied at some point in time. But that being said, I believe we're doing things different in some cases and repeating also things that we believe had done well in the past."

You have seen a lot of activity in this area and making -- reformulating products to reflect the consumer trend. The second one, we are innovating and we're accelerating the rate of innovation both in center stores to bring back the traffic to that part of the stores and an impairment of where we have 2 large businesses, the cheese and dairy and the refrigerated meal businesses.

As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on 3 o",496,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our results and talk about the year ahead, I want to provide context to today's conversation by reviewing our goals and strategy. As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on 3 objectives: profitable sales growth, achieving and maintaining best-in-class margins and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This is our multiyear plan on the one page, and it's important to understand that not everything starts to deliver at once. In some cases, like revenue management, it's not a project. We must build an internal capability before we can achieve sustainable results and return.
So with that as a background, let's turn to Slide 3 to talk about where are we on our journey. Overall, 2015 was a year of significant accomplish for Kraft Heinz. We came together as one global organization and began building on the rich history of our dynamic company. The integration team executed an extensive action plan with 2 main objectives: One, operating as one company with one set of goals and business objectives; and two, achieving solid alignment on the 2016 budget, built from the bottom up by countries and field teams. In many ways, we are pleased with what did not happen in 2015, namely business disruption. We made difficult but necessary decisions around organization restructure that will improve our efficiency, making Kraft Heinz more competitive and accelerating our investment in our brands, products and people. We have already made solid investment in our people, promoting more than 2,400 team members worldwide and introducing a new long-term incentive program that gives many employees the opportunity to increase their ownership in the company.
In short, our vision, values and process are building the culture of ownership and empowerment necessary for the long-term achievements of our company.
We have also made significant investment in our world-class brands. We were successful with Big Bets and innovations like Lunchables, P3, Heinz Yellow Mustard, sauces in Europe and mayo in Brazil. And we continue to support strong levels of investment in R&D to carry forward Big Bets in 2016 and 2017.
Finally, we've made meaningful progress across our global operations. We significantly improved our case-through [ph] rate in United States and Europe to over 97%, our best performance in both the legacy Heinz and legacy Kraft business in quite a while. We delivered solid EBITDA and margin gains based on savings from manufacturing footprint efficiencies and improved product mix. And we achieved strong performance in the U.S. cheese and meat business, effectively managing pricing, net of commodity costs. This led to the established -- of a solid financial base for the new Kraft Heinz Company that we believe can grow strongly and sustainably.
Before I go to our agenda for 2016, I'm going to ask George and Paulo to talk about how we ended 2015 and provide a deeper update on the overall status of our key business. George?"

Turning to Slide 4. I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond, and that's despite a sizable step",567,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond, and that's despite a sizable step-down in volume and mix performance in Q4.
So why am I optimistic? Several reasons. First, we're driving profitable net sales with significantly lower promotional activity versus Q4 2014. As you can see on the slide, we drove solid 1.2% non-promoted consumption in Q4 and 1.5% non-promoted consumption for the full year for our combined portfolio in the United States. This was driven by innovation, new product news and increased and working media behind ketchup, pasta sauces, Lunchables, P3, cold cuts, single-serve coffee and cream cheese.
Secondly, our shipments were below consumption in the fourth quarter. This was due to shipment timing versus prior periods and mainly related to comparisons with Q4 last year when, for instance, we were filling the retail pipeline ahead of our launch of McCafé as well as the business losses in the Foodservice highlighted on our last call. But this is now behind us, and we are pursuing a solid development plan for our Foodservice business in 2016.
Third is the fact that our integration initiatives are beginning to have an impact with organizational structure savings contributing to EBITDA growth in Q4. And looking forward, savings from ZBB should begin to be realized across our combined operations, and modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint should ramp up significantly.
Finally, I am also confident about our prospects because of our robust innovation pipeline, Big Bets and my belief that we are well positioned to build on our 2015 accomplishments in 2016. In particular, we'll become even more equipped and more focused on putting product and investable marketing ideas into the marketplace against some of our biggest turnaround opportunities. I'm not going to tell you that we have a solution for every part of our portfolio just yet. But I do believe our pipeline is in better shape to commercialize trend-bending products into the marketplace. And we will be in even better shape as we execute our footprint initiative over the next 2 years.
Let me give you a few and quick examples of what to look for on your next round of store checks. Capri Sun Organic is now in the marketplace with advertising scheduled to hit later in the second quarter. We're making changes to ensure that Mac & Cheese is more relevant today than ever before with no artificial flavors, preservatives or synthetic colors. And you will hear us making noise about this very soon. Also, we are working to improve our nutritional frozen meal offering, which we will talk about later in the year.
We will support these and other Big Bets with a solid increase in working media dollars. I hope you all saw our Meet the Ketchups campaign that we kicked off during the Super Bowl. It is part of a major marketing campaign behind Heinz Ketchup.
We expect 2016 will be a strong marketing year for us, including a further shift of our advertising spend from nonworking to working media with our goal of increasing working media to at least 3/4 of our marketing budget. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail."
278212,323693560,941693,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015. One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was the strong",1551,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015. One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was the strong negative currency translation, an impact that grew to the 6% range on the top line and 9% to 10% of EBITDA beginning in the third quarter when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And we expect this to continue through the first half of 2016.
Net pricing was 0.2 to favorable in all segments in both Q4 and the full year. This was driven by a combination of price increases and taking out inefficient rate spending, partially offset by lower net pricing related to lower net commodity costs across our big 4 commodities in the U.S. and Canada. And with dairy prices remaining low, this is something we are likely to see continue into the first half of 2016. We had negative volume/mix in the U.S., Canada and Europe that offset strong growth in Rest of World. The volume/mix decline accelerated in Q4 but mainly due to factors not expected to repeat, and I'll talk more about those with our segment results.
At the EBITDA line, we delivered strong growth in Q4 and the full year, driven by restructuring and integration savings, expanding our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 200 basis points for the full year.
Dropping down to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.62 did benefit by approximately $0.03 from the 53rd week. But this was more than offset by roughly $0.10 from 
[Audio Gap]
So far this year, we incurred tax expenses related to the repatriation of foreign earnings done as part of our legal restructuring integration process. This pushed our Q4 implied tax rate into the mid-30s and for the full year to just over 30%.
By contrast, in 2014, we had favorable tax impact that drove implied tax rates on adjusted EPS into the mid-20% range for both Q4 and full year. That being said, we continue to believe that an effective tax rate of approximately 30% is fairly representative of our average rate on an ongoing basis. That's the total company.
Let's turn to Slide 6 in our U.S. segment results. You can see here that we had sequentially weaker organic net sales growth in Q4. This was due to weaker overall volume/mix. The primary sources of the volume/mix decline were consistent with what we've seen all year: category trends and volume loss associated with higher net pricing in ready-to-drink beverage, powdered beverage and boxed dinners; category and market share declines in nutritional frozen meals; and lower Foodservice shipments due to lost bids at some key customers.
In Q4, 2 other factors resulted in unfavorable comparison and a further year-on-year decline in volume/mix: one, shipment timing, meaningfully impacted by the pipeline shipments for the launch of McCafé last year; and two, we executed significant promotional activity in Q4 2014, particularly in parts of our cheese and spoonable portfolios that we chose not to repeat this year. 
Looking forward, we don't expect either of these factors to hold back our Q1 volume/mix performance. By contrast, growth in pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. accelerated in Q4 as did adjusted EBITDA margin on both year-over-year basis and sequentially versus Q3. Consistent with the full year, the U.S. benefited from a combination of favorable pricing net of cost and lower overhead.
In Q4, our adjusted EBITDA growth and margins picked up momentum from a combination of increased integration savings and better overhead cost performance, as the unfavorable bonus accrual comparisons we faced in Q3 faded.
In Canada, on Slide 7, our results continue to reflect a double-digit currency translation headwind that grew as the year progressed as well as challenges to increase prices to offset higher input costs in local currency terms. Our price realization improved in Q4 relative to full year. However, volume/mix declined global organic net sales growth into negative territory. For the year, this was mainly caused by lower shipments in Foodservice, refreshment beverage and infant nutrition. 
In the fourth quarter, the decline in volume/mix was greater, primarily due to comparisons with prior year in Foodservice and coffee, including last year's launch-related shipments of McCafé. Adjusted EBITDA in Canada was relatively flat for the year but up mid-single digits in Q4. This reflected the fact that our price realization had caught up to higher local input costs. That being said, our Canadian business is facing further local cost inflation in many categories. And this month, we are implementing additional pricing actions to offset the higher cost.
Turning to Europe on Slide 8. While currency translation remained unfavorable, it was slightly less of a drag on our reported results in Q4 than what we had seen most of the year. Beyond currency, the drivers in Europe remained largely the same in Q4 as it had been year-to-date. Net pricing gains from strategic pricing in ketchup and mayonnaise across a number of markets offset by lower volume/mix. In terms of volume/mix, despite the significant improvement in our product mix, volume/mix was down in the mid-single digits for both the year and Q4. This was primarily driven by volume declines related to cutting inefficient promotional activities in U.K. beans, price increase in ketchup and ongoing consumption declines in Italy infant nutrition.
In addition, we experienced lower U.K. soup shipments in Q4 due to a combination of 3 factors: one, our own efforts to reduce low-return promotional frequency; two, competitors moving to increase price based on competitive activity to gain market share; and three, all these happening during unseasonably warm weather at the start of the soup season. While this scenario will likely remain challenging for us in Q1, we are now putting in place plans to drive better soup consumption and defend market share.
In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver double-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the year. And we did this while significantly increasing working media during the year.
So overall, we feel good about the health of our European business, and we will continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward.
Finally is Rest of World on Slide 9. Here, negative currency translation remained at elevated level in Q4, roughly 33% of net sales and 56% at EBITDA, consistent with the increased impact we saw in Q3 when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. And at the current exchange rates, this is likely to continue during the first part of 2016. 
Organic net sales grew more than 9% in both Q4 and the full year, with volume/mix gains getting stronger as the year progress. For the year, volume/mix growth was driven by strength in ketchup, condiments and sauces across all regions. And these gains more than offset declines in our COMPLAN nutritional beverage business in India. 
In the fourth quarter, better consumption trends in both Asia and Latin America drove increased volume/mix growth. At EBITDA, we posted strong constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the full year, driven by volume gains, mix improvements as well as cost savings from ZBB and manufacturing footprint efficiencies.
Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on both synergies and capital structure. I will start with synergies on Slide 10. Overall, we remain on track in each of the 3 areas of our integration program: organizational structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. In 2015, we incurred $829 million of costs, with roughly 2/3 of those costs related to severance and employee benefit and we spent only about $225 million in CapEx related to the program.
Our estimate of the total cost to achieve our targeted savings remains the same: $1.9 billion of pretax cost, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of cash cost and roughly $800 million in noncash expenses like assets write-offs and accelerated depreciation; and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization. I would also note that in 2016, we expect capital expenditures to ramp up considerably as we begin to roll out the bulk of our footprint initiatives. As a result, the majority of the cost to achieve our program will be spent in 2016.
As far as savings, we realized roughly $125 million of savings in 2015. And we continue to target and remain confident in our ability to deliver aggressive cost savings of $1.5 billion net of inflation by 2017.
Turning to Slide 11. I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share today. In addition, we ended 2015 at just over 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, including preferred stock and are confident we can deliver against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3x adjusted EBITDA over the medium term.
An important step in that process will be refinance our preferred stock when it becomes callable in June. And at current interest rates, this would be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective for the company. 
I'll now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our prepared remarks."

Similar to what you saw in 2015, we expect currency and consumption trends to remain meaningful headwinds across most market in the year. And as Paulo told you, our general managers from Canada to Asia will continue to face pressure to increase prices in many categories to offset higher input costs in local currency. There is also the ongoing need to drive better consumption in the face of both consumer weakness and consumer desire for fresher, less processed food.
All of that said, we're very excited about how Kraft Heinz is positioned. To unleash growth, we continue to focus on innovation, go-to-market capabilities and increasing working media dollars. We will build our innovation pipeline through Big Bets in each market. And as the year unfolds, we'll see us launch advanced in areas where consumers are migrating. Importantly, we will continue to take a portfolio approach within the key categories in which we compete, from premium to value offering to meet consumers' demand across the spectrum.
On the cost side, we expect to make significant progress on delivering best-in-class margin through: one, delivering ZBB savings; two, making progress on our manufacturing footprint initiative; and finally, building a real performance-driven culture in Kraft Heinz.
It's still early. And as we evolve, I will continue to share our plans. Overall, these are exciting and challenging times for the Kraft Heinz family. In 2015, we took steps to build a solid base for sustainable growth. We are executing a strong pipeline of initiatives in 2016 and our synergy plans are laid out throughout 2017, which will create an even bigger opportunity to invest in our people, our brands and our products.
Overall, we are confident that the company is on track towards our vision: to be the best food company, growing a better world.
Thank you. And now we would be happy to take your questions."

I think it's important as we highlight in the remarks to go to the specific items of the fourth quarter, right? Paulo already went from all the regions on the specifics. And there were some challenged categories, like frozen meals or soup in U.K. But when you see our market share performance and so on, they have been growing quite stable in most part of that. So most part of what you're seeing, we saw a lot of really leaving negative ROI initiatives that really didn't support the company for the long run, as we continue to build the pillars and push us to really a profitable sales agenda. As I always said and it's important to remind we're a sales organization. And with that in mind, what I can tell you that I think from the Heinz comparison you made in the beginning, and so I think there are a lot of difference in a positive way. First, we are pushing this agenda of innovation of go-to-market capabilities and higher marketing dollars in a much faster pace than we did at that time, okay?

Yes, we are very pleased with the work we did on PNOC and not just in Q4 or the last 2 quarters that you have mentioned but right throughout 2015, particularly in dairy, in meat, in coffee. And we believe the strength of our brand equities and the investments that we have been making and we continue to make in these brands is allowing us to do that. Do we feel this is sustainable? Yes, we do. And the reason we feel it's sustainable is because while we were doing this and the PNOC is being healthy and positive for us, if you look at the market share, which you have access to, we managed to grow share in all these categories. For example, we grew share in cream cheese. We grew share in processed. We grew share in American slices. We grew share in Oscar Mayer beef combos. We grew share in snack nuts and seeds. We grew share in coffee. Dairy is where we lost some share, softening in nacho cheese and hot dogs. And it was our willingness not to chase the market down. So that's if you want the reasons why we believe what we did is sustainable. And without strong brands, we won't be able to do that. That's the first part. The second part of your question, we are now of a size where we believe that assessing our market -- go-to-market model and sales by focusing on our capability to cover more areas and be more extensive, and the frequency, of course, would be higher, would allow us to do more.

Look at the performance of Heinz Yellow Mustard, you look at P3 and look at hot sauces in Europe. And there are others coming to market in 2016. What's fair to say, to your question, that we're going to need to be much more robust on the testing, design, understanding consumers and really coming big and supportive to make it a win in the marketplace.

Let me comment on the European part of your question, then we'll go to the lessons. I think when we see the fourth quarter, it's true, experience is a little more challenged environment in the market in Europe. And that's pretty much a push by really the soup segment in U.K., what we went through to really a lower-level promotion and we experienced some problem in the distribution with some of our retail partners in U.K. And the fact that the infant category in Italy, while we have a stable and growing market share, but continue to decline at a fast pace. When we think about reacting to that and we're already seeing that reaction, it's not really only infusing more trade to your question, but actually getting the right level of promotion with the positive returns and with the right mechanism of trade, something George just mentioned, the question before. So we can have a win-win situation. We tell our partners in U.K. and Europe. And I think there is a solid trend in place to really push Italy to a different level in 2016. So it's true that we experience more challenge than we face in the fourth quarter in Europe, especially the U.K. situation I mentioned. It's also true that we continue to grow market share in that market except for soup. So what I'm seeing now in the first quarter and especially moving forward from here is the fact that we're investing more, but we're investing in the right instruments with positive return. On the second part of your question about the lessons from Heinz. And so like I said before, I think a lot of the agendas in Heinz that we push innovation, evolve from market capabilities, higher media spend and so on, it took us almost a year when we started to push this agenda. I think now, given some knowledge we had before, the integration going well and a lot of other elements of the Kraft Heinz merger make us push this agenda in a faster pace. So -- and there are some lessons from instruments, the way we went through the revenue management initiatives and other things with SKU rationalization and footprint initiatives and so that we learned the lessons to be applied here. I'm sure we're going to learn other lessons in this merger that we will be applied at some point in time. But that being said, I believe we're doing things different in some cases and repeating also things that we believe had done well in the past."

Overall, because of our size and the diverse businesses and categories we operate in, we will probably reflect what would go on in the marketplace. The focus on growing volume for us would be largely done through the following: One is renovating our product range. You have seen a lot of activity in this area in making -- reformulating products to reflect the consumer trend. The second one, we are innovating and we're accelerating the rate of innovation both in center stores to bring back the traffic to that part of the stores and an impairment of where we have 2 large businesses, the cheese and dairy and the refrigerated meat businesses. And now that the Foodservice business have a very strong white space program. What I mean, by that white space program is when we merge the 2 foodservices business unit, we saw that our legacy businesses were not overlapping a lot. We're actually complementary to each other.

As expe",779,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Here we are again. It seems like only a few weeks ago, we're reviewing Q4 results. Last call, we gave our agenda for 2016. So how are we doing so far? 
We are off to a good start. Good, not great. As expected, some headwinds hang around, including consumption trends in some key categories that held us back. 
On our last call, we spoke about plans to address categories such as U.K. soup, U.S. Mac & Cheese, ready-to-drink beverage and frozen nutritional meals. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance as the year unfolds, they held back our results in Q1. 
At the same time, our emphasis on profitable sales growth is paying off. Our market share trends are improving behind utilization and marketing investments. For instance, investments we have made in our global ketchup franchise are leading category growth in the U.S., Canada and Europe and driving strong growth for us in developing markets.
In Europe, outside our U.K. soup, the rest of the portfolio is improving share performance in a challenging consumer and retail environment. 
And we are seeing good gains from investment in the Rest of World, pasta sauce in Latin America, soy sauce in China and soups and mayo in Australia.
We're also able to improve our sales and go-to-market execution in what remains a challenging retail environment. For instance, our rate in the United States was 98%. Europe was above target at more than 99%. And Canada achieved, for the first time, 97%.
Why is this so important? As we implement our manufacturing footprint initiatives, we are trying to keep our focus in 2 areas: customer service, where we had a good performance with our customers, was shown by increased service levels in the quarter. In fact, we're already becoming the benchmark for customer service in some key categories. And second, product quality, where I'm pleased to report progress in the quarter, but with a lot of work still to be done.
Regarding the integration programs. I'm also happy to report that our savings are coming faster than we are expecting, roughly $225 million in Q1. Paulo will speak more about where we stand with the overall program later. 
But faster progress towards our goal to achieve best-in-class margin allowed us to invest with greater confidence, as we lay the groundwork for future growth.
Our Big Bets launches are starting to gain traction in the marketplace, and we have more to come. George will talk about our strong pipeline for U.S. Big Bets. 
In Europe, we continue to go after the opportunity to grow condiments and sauces, with a March volatile Heinz series good mayonnaise in the U.K., Spain, Italy and Germany. 
In Italy, we launched [indiscernible], which contains a proprietary function ingredient and significantly improves babies' immune system. 
And in both Europe and North America, we are beginning to go after whitespace opportunity in foodservice.
Finally, we took further steps to bring our performance-driving culture to life. As part of our MBO process, managed [ph] but with objective process, first quarter performance appraises are going well. We now have 6,000 employees worldwide who have MBOs, up from 3,000 at this point last year. 
So overall, good operation progress that we expect lead to better execution and profitable growth going forward.
But let's turn to Slide 3 to see what it means for our Q1 financial results.
On the top line, while you saw foreign exchange drag in Q3 and Q4 last year into a SKU of 4.5% headwind on Q1 results. That being said, we had a solid organic net sales performance, up 1.1%, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and price. 
Pricing was up 0.3% points, reflecting gains in most segments, despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada.
Volume/mix was up 0.8% points, reflecting growth in: first, condiments and sauces globally, with particular strength in developing markets; second, Lunchables and P3 in U.S.; and finally, foodservice expansion in the United States.
At EBITDA, we drove strong dollar growth and margin performance, both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4, despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. This was driven by a combination of our strong cost savings performance, favor pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior year and profitable top line growth.
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 37.7% versus the year ago period to $0.73, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Now I will hand over the Georges and Paulo to talk more about we did in each reporting segment and what we expect going forward. Georges?"

Turning to Slide 4. Overall, we are encouraged by our U.S. results so far this year, as it reflects steady commercial execution in a year of transformation. 
In the first quarter, we had a mix of positive and negative we have seen before. We have continued our momentum from investments in Heinz Ketchup and Mustard, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Lunchables and P3 and ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts. At the same time, consumption and shared challenges in ready-to-drink beverages, Mac & Cheese, frozen nutritional meals and salad dressing remain, and I will mention what we are doing about it in a moment. 
We did deliver sequentially stronger organic growth in Q1, although you would note that our growth was above consumption, which you would have seen in our first quarter data. This was due to 3 factors. First, we saw solid growth in our foodservice business and nontraditional retail channel like club and dollars stores. This is consistent with the business development for whitespace opportunities I mentioned on our last call. Much of it has been enabled by the combination of the Kraft and Heinz foodservice team, and we should continue growing in coming quarters.
The other 2 factors were new product pipelines still from our solid innovation agenda and shipment timing between quarters, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. 
We also saw our cost-saving initiatives pick up pace sequentially from Q4. This is from ZBB and procurement savings adding momentum to the organizational structure savings we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. It positions us well as we ramp up modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint and continue to invest behind our brand and Big Bet over the rest of the year.
I hope you have seen some of our advertising already, but our Big Bets activities are beginning to gain some traction in the marketplace, with more activities to come. For example, the launch of our Kraft Mac & Cheese renovation has been well-received by consumers, and we supplemented that with the launch of new premium Mac & Cheese under the [indiscernible] brand in the same category. 
We launched Capri Sun Organic and renovated our Kool-Aid Jammers product with fewer calories and no preservatives. We added a new line of premium pasta sauces under the Classico Reserva [ph] brand, made with no artificial ingredients or added sugar.
We strengthened our barbecue sauces business by adding new lines under the Heinz brand, betting on consumer regional preferences in this category. 
And we added new lines to our salad dressing business, including new packaging formats.
It's very early days, and we are not claiming victory in any category. But to the extent we can prove the trend-bending ability of our Big Bets, it's not only good for Kraft Heinz. It's good for the center of the store in general. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our prepared comments."

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on U.S. Q1 financials. 
Within organic growth, pricing was flat, reflecting pricing against -- across most categories, despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Flat volume/mix mainly reflected innovation in Lunchables and P3, the foodservice gains and shipment timing Georges discussed and gains in coffee that were partially offset by lower shipments of ready-to-drink beverage, where we were up against a preprice increase buying Capri Sun last year, as well as lower consumption of bacon and frozen nutritional meals. 
The Easter holiday shift did not play a significant role versus last year. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, this was driven by integration program savings as well as 2 other factors. One was favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs and the fact that we were comparing against the Q1 last year, where the Kraft business saw pricing trail the impact of key commodity costs.
While we've seen a similar benefit for the past couple of quarters, we expect the pricing to be more in line with key commodities costs as we move forward.
The order factor and offset impact was unfavorable volume decline in ready-to-drink beverage and frozen nutritional meals. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about the key factors impacting Canada in the first quarter.
In Canada, we continued to see strong currency headwinds, but the negative 10 percentage point impact from currency was slightly less intense than what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year.
Organically, we delivered sequentially better sales performance, with pricing gains exceeding the related decline in volume/mix.
As we said on the last call, heading into 2016, we were facing challenges to increase prices in order to offset higher input costs in local currency terms. As a result, we saw positive pricing of 3.7% despite headwinds related to deflation in selected key commodities.
Volume/mix went down 2.2 percentage points, as growth in condiments and sauces was more than offset by a decline in cheese due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q1 last year as well as lower coffee and food stub shipment.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 33.6% versus the year ago period, despite a negative 14.2 percentage points impact from currency. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume. 
Overall, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this Q1 in Canada. However, I would note that some of the Q1 upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus declining commodity costs. As a result, we would not expect our EBITDA margins in Canada to continue at that level seen in Q1, as price levels are expected to be more consistent with the key commodity costs in coming quarters. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. In contrast to Q1 profitability in Canada being better than we would expect for the balance of the year, we expect the balance of the year in Europe to be progressively better than what we saw in Q1. While we saw sequential improvement in Europe in organic sales performance in Q1, including an improving volume/mix trend, it was still down and down largely due to higher promotional spending versus the prior year. 
The increase in promotional expanding was due to 2 factors: first was a return to more normal promotional frequencies in U.K. beans versus the prior year. And as a result, we saw a solid lift in U.K. bean volume. 
The second factor affecting pricing was the Q1 in fusion of promotionary spending in U.K. soup to address distribution losses from Q4 program execution. While this led to a solid March performance, our January and February results were much more like what we saw in Q4, made worse by the fact we were at high of the soup season.
This, along with the lower shipments of infant nutrition in U.K. and Italy, led to a volume/mix decline of 0.8 percentage points and offset both the solid volume gains in U.K. beans as well as ongoing growth in condiments and sauces across Europe.
Constant currency EBITDA also went down versus prior year and margins were less, both sequentially and versus prior year. Again, this was primarily due to investments in pricing to defend U.K. Soup as well as weaker category consumption in that category.
We also had higher marketing costs versus prior year in Q1, driven by investments behind Big Bet, but coming ahead of growth from this initiatives that we expect late in the year.
In the end, we feel better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, and I continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. 
Here, we saw slightly less foreign currency drag in Q1 versus Q3 and Q4 but still over 25%, mainly due to recognized devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015.
In terms of organic growth, we saw greater organic sales growth for the second quarter in a row, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and pricing. 
Pricing of 2.1% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix went up 8.3 percentage points due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions as well as strong beverage growth in Indonesia versus the prior year period. But I would note that the Indonesian beverage growth was mainly due to an earlier Ramadan shipment, so we will give back part of this favorability in Q2. 
At EBITDA, we saw 12.1% decline in adjusted EBITDA due to a negative 38.2 percentage point impact from currency, 29.5 percentage points of which was from Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q1, driven almost exclusively by volume gains and mix improvement. 
That covers our Q1 results. Before we go to Q&A, I want to quickly provide an update on 2 areas: our capital structure and our expectations for the balance of 2016. 
I will start with capital structure on Slide 9. I think it's important to recognize the significant steps we've taken and plan to take to strengthen our capital structure. As you may have seen in our 10-K, we've taken steps to reduce and derisk our pension and postretirement liability. We've closed or added executive retirement benefits plan, where possible. And doing both last year and the first quarter, we've been taking actions to improve our funded status by approximately $1.7 billion and further derisk our plans by an additional $1.7 billion through terminations, buyouts and lump sum offering.
We've also been able to match our debt with our underlying business structure and believe we've made our balance sheet and P&L well-protected against currency volatility. 
Going forward, we remain confident in reducing leverage from roughly 4x net debt to rolling 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 to less than 3x over the medium term.
In addition to growing EBITDA, 3 factors will also help us to get here. One important step will be refinance our preferred stock when it becomes redeemable in June. At current interest rates, we expect this will be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective. 
Second, we continue to expect to pay down $2 billion of debt by July 2017. 
And third, we are planning to commence any common stock repurchase until at least July 2017. 
Overall, we are making good progress in balancing a conservative financial policy while remaining committed to a strong dividend payout.
That brings us to Slide 10, in our outlook. First, we remain on track or ahead in each of the 3 areas of our integration program: organizational structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. All our targets remain the same: savings and cost switching. We continue to target cost savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, fully realized in 2017. And we will still anticipate $1.9 billion of pretax P&L costs, including $1.1 billion in cash. 
Through Q1, we've been taking roughly $1.1 billion or just over half of the total P&L costs, including roughly $700 million or 65% of our likely cash expense.
On the capital expenditure side, we continue to anticipate $1.1 billion of CapEx from the integration program.
To date, integration-related CapEx has been just over $300 million or roughly 30% of the CapEx spend we are anticipating. But keep in mind that integration-related CapEx is in addition to the 2.5% to 3% of net sales we expect to spend on an ongoing basis.
As far as our 2016 outlook goes, based on our results through Q1, we remain confident that we will make meaningful progress this year towards our goal of achieving best-in-class margin. That being said, as I mentioned earlier, pricing is likely to be more in line with key commodity costs going forward. And faster ZBB savings will give way to organizational structure savings beginning to lap around September.
By contrast, we expect to see stronger EPS in the second half of the year due to expected earnings accretion from refinancing our preferred stock in June. 
That's our current expectation from a financial perspective, but we have significant work ahead of us to realize our potential. We have additional Big Bets launch as the year progresses, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of both Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. 
We are also ramping up our IT and supply chain footprint activities significantly. And we are highly aware that, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. And making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis throughout the year.
Kraft Heinz is in a good position to unleash profitable growth. But as Bernardo said on our last call, it's also a time of significant challenge for the Kraft Heinz Company.

And like we say are really 3 pillars. It's innovation to our Big Bets strategy, more marketing expenditures and building the go-to-market capabilities. And if you see what's happening in the company, it's actually the opposite. If you see marketing expenditures going up, selling expenditures going up and the Big Bets are coming at a faster pace. So there are large challenges in our categories, and like Georges was saying before, still a lot for us to do to overcome them, not only here in the United States, but also in different areas of the world. But we truly believe we are preserving and investing where our consumers can see the marketplace and the efficiencies can help us to have a comparative advantage to push the agenda of profitable growth.

I think where we are underperforming is largely sometimes we are missing the mark from a consumer trends point of view, rather than having a different business model. Our business model applies to all categories similarly. So from a relationship with retailers, we believe we have a very strong relationship. We have a positive relationship, and we see a positive outlook there.

We have been working very hard to ensure that we didn't get any disruption, and we will continue working very hard not to get any disruption moving forward. However, there are a lot of headwind coming at us, as you know, that is putting downward pressure on sales because historically, in the U.S. market, the growth did not come from volume. If you look back for the last number of years, it came from inflation, and that inflation was based on commodities inflation. Now we are living in an environment, where there is no inflation in commodities. So it is harder to be able to say -- to have a bullish approach to growth. What we said, and we will continue to maintain that we will have stable top line. And as you know, we have an exposure to a large number of commodities, so it's very hard to put exact numbers to it.

As expect",780,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Here we are again. It seems like only a few weeks ago we are reviewing Q4 results. Last call, we gave our agenda for 2016. So how are we doing so far? 
We are off to a good start, good, not great. As expected, some headwinds hung around, including consumption trends in some key categories that held us back. 
On our last call, we spoke about plans to address categories such as U.K. soup, U.S. Mac & Cheese, ready-to-drink beverage and frozen nutritional meals. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance as the year unfolds, they held back our results in Q1. 
At the same time, our emphasis on profitable sales growth is paying off. Our market share trends are improving behind innovation and marketing investments. For instance, investments we have made in our global ketchup franchise are leading category growth in the U.S., Canada and Europe and driving strong growth for us in developing markets.
In Europe, outside our U.K. soup, the rest of the portfolio is improving share performance in a challenging consumer and retail environment. And we are seeing good gains from investment in the Rest of World, pasta sauce in Latin America, soy sauce in China and soups and mayo in Australia.
We're also able to improve our sales and go-to-market execution in what remains a challenging retail environment. For instance, our case fill rate in United States was 98%. Europe was above target at more than 99%. And Canada achieved, for the first time, 97%.
Why is this so important? As we implement our manufacturing footprint initiatives, we are trying to keep our focus in 2 areas,  customer service, where we had a good performance with our customers, which is shown by increased service levels in the quarter. In fact, we're already becoming the benchmark for customer service in some key categories. And second, product quality, where I'm pleased to report progress in the quarter but with a lot of work still to be done.
Regarding the integration program, I'm also happy to report that our savings are coming faster than we were expecting, roughly $225 million in Q1. Paulo will speak more about where we stand with the overall program later. But faster progress towards our goal to achieve best-in-class margins allowed us to invest with greater confidence as we lay the groundwork for future growth.
Our Big Bet launches are starting to gain traction in the marketplace, and we have more to come. George will talk about our strong pipeline for U.S. Big Bet. 
In Europe, we continue to go after the opportunity to grow condiments and sauces with the March launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in the U.K., Spain, Italy and Germany. In Italy, we launched Plasmon Nutrimune, which contains a proprietary function ingredient that significantly improves babies' immune system. And in both Europe and North America, we're beginning to go after whitespace opportunities in foodservice.
Finally, we took further steps to bring our performance-driven culture to life. As part of our MBO process, management by objectives process, first quarter performance appraisals are going well. We now have 6,000 employees worldwide who have MBOs, up from 3,000 at this point last year. 
So overall, good operation progress that we expect to lead to better execution and profitable growth going forward.
But let's turn to Slide 3 to see what it means for our Q1 financial results. On the top line, while we saw less foreign exchange drag than Q3 and Q4 last year, it was still a 4.5% headwind on Q1 results. That being said, we had a solid organic net sales performance, up 1.1%, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and price. Price was up 0.3% points, reflecting gains in most segments despite deflation in key commodities in United States and Canada. Volume/mix was up 0.8% points, reflecting growth in, first, condiments and sauces globally with particular strength in developing markets; second, Lunchables and P3 in U.S.; and finally, foodservice expansion in United States.
At EBITDA, we drove strong dollar growth and margin performance, both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4 despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. This was driven by a combination of our strong cost savings performance, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior year and profitable top line growth.
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 37.7% versus the year-ago period to $0.73, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Now I will hand over to George and Paulo to talk more about how did in each reporting segment and what we expect going forward. George?"

Overall, we are encouraged by our U.S. results so far this year as it reflects steady commercial execution in a year of transformation. In the first quarter, we had a mix of positive and negative we have seen before. We have continued our momentum from investments in Heinz Ketchup and Mustard, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Lunchables and P3 and ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts. At the same time, consumption and shared challenges in ready-to-drink beverages, Mac & Cheese, frozen nutritional meals and salad dressings remain, and I will mention what we are doing about it in a moment. 
We did deliver sequentially stronger organic growth in Q1, although you will note that our growth was above consumption, which you would have seen in our first quarter scanner data. This was due to 3 factors. First, we saw solid growth in our foodservice business and nontraditional retail channels like clubs and dollar stores. This is consistent with the business development or whitespace opportunities I mentioned on our last call. Much of it has been enabled by the combination of the Kraft and Heinz foodservice teams, and we should continue growing in coming quarters.
The other 2 factors were new product pipelines fill from our solid innovation agenda and shipment timing between quarters, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. 
We also saw our cost-saving initiatives pick up pace sequentially from Q4. This is from ZBB and procurement savings, adding momentum to the organizational structure savings we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. It positions us well as we ramp up modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint and continue to invest behind our brand and Big Bet over the rest of the year.
I hope you have seen some of our advertising already, but our Big Bets activities are beginning to gain some traction in the marketplace with more activities to come. For example, the launch of our Kraft Mac & Cheese renovation has been well received by consumers, and we supplemented that with the launch of new premium Mac & Cheese under the Cracker Barrel brand in the same category. 
We launched Capri Sun Organic and renovated our Kool-Aid Jammers product with fewer calories and no preservatives. We added a new line of premium pasta sauces under the Classic Riserva brand made with no artificial ingredients or added sugar. We strengthened our BBQ sauces business by adding new line under the Heinz brand, betting on consumer regional preferences in this category. And we added new lines to our salad dressing business, including new packaging format.
It's very early days, and we are not claiming victory in any category. But to the extent we can prove the trend-bending ability of our Big Bets, it's not only good for Kraft Heinz, it's good for the center of the store in general. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our prepared comments."

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on U.S. Q1 financials. Within organic growth, pricing was flat, reflecting pricing against -- across most categories despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Flat volume/mix mainly reflected innovation in Lunchables and P3, the foodservice gains and shipment timing George discussed and gains in coffee that were partially offset by lower shipments of ready-to-drink beverage, where we were up against a preprice increase buying with Capri Sun last year as well as lower consumption of bacon and frozen nutritional meals. The Easter holiday shift did not play a significant role versus last year. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, this was driven by integration program savings as well as 2 other factors. One was favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs and the fact that we were comparing against the Q1 last year where the Kraft business saw pricing trail the impact of key commodity costs.
While we've seen a similar benefit for the past couple of quarters, we expect the pricing to be more in line with key commodities costs as we move forward. The other factor, an offset impact, was unfavorable volume declines in ready-to-drink beverages and frozen nutritional meals. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about the key factors impacting Canada in the first quarter. In Canada, we continued to see strong currency headwinds, but the negative 10 percentage point impact from currency was slightly less intense than what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year. Organically, we delivered sequentially better sales performance with pricing gains exceeding the related decline in volume/mix.
As we said on the last call, heading into 2016, we were facing challenges to increase prices in order to offset higher input costs in local currency terms. As a result, we saw positive pricing of 3.7% despite headwinds related to deflation in selected key commodities.
Volume/mix went down 2.2 percentage points as solid growth in condiments and sauces was more than offset by a decline in cheese due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q1 last year as well as lower coffee and foodservice shipments.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 33.6% versus the year-ago period despite a negative 14.2 percentage points impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.
Overall, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this Q1 in Canada. However, I would note that some of the Q1 upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus declining commodity costs. As a result, we will not expect our EBITDA margins in Canada to continue at that level seen in Q1 as price levels are expected to be more consistent with the key commodity costs in coming quarters. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. In contrast to Q1 profitability in Canada being better than we would expect for the balance of the year, we expect the balance of the year in Europe to be progressively better than what we saw in Q1. While we saw sequential improvement in Europe's organic sales performance in Q1, including an improving volume/mix trend, it was still down and down largely due to higher promotional spending versus the prior year. The increase in promotional spending was due to 2 factors: first was a return to more normal promotional frequency in U.K. beans versus the prior year. And as a result, we saw a solid lift in U.K. bean volume. 
The second factor affecting pricing was the Q1 infusion of promotional spending in U.K. soup to address distribution losses from Q4 programming execution. While this led to a solid March performance, our January and February results were much more like what we saw in Q4, made worse by the fact we were at high of the soup season.
This, along with the lower shipments of infant nutrition in U.K. and Italy, led to a volume/mix decline of 0.8 percentage points and offset both the solid volume gains in U.K. beans as well as ongoing growth in condiments and sauces across Europe.
Constant currency EBITDA also went down versus prior year, and margins were less, both sequentially and versus prior year. Again, this was primarily due to investments in pricing to defend U.K. soup as well as weaker category consumption in that category.
We also had higher marketing costs versus prior year in Q1, driven by investments behind Big Bet, but coming ahead of growth from this initiatives that we expect late in the year.
In the end, we feel better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, and I continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, we saw slightly less foreign currency drag in Q1 versus Q3 and Q4 but still over 25%, mainly due to recognized devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015. 
In terms of organic growth, we saw greater organic sales growth for the second quarter in a row driven by a good balance of volume/mix and pricing. 
Pricing of 2.1% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix went up 8.3 percentage points due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions as well as strong beverage growth in Indonesia versus the prior year period. But I would note that the Indonesian beverage growth was mainly due to earlier Ramadan shipments, so we will give back part of this favorability in Q2. 
At EBITDA, we saw a 12.1% decline in adjusted EBITDA due to a negative 38.2 percentage point impact from currency, 29.5 percentage points of which was from Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q1, driven almost exclusively by volume gains and mix improvement. 
That covers our Q1 results. Before we go to Q&A, I want to quickly provide an update on 2 areas: our capital structure and our expectations for the balance of 2016. 
I will start with capital structure on Slide 9. I think it's important to recognize the significant steps we've taken and plan to take to strengthen our capital structure. As you may have seen in our 10-K, we've taken steps to reduce and de-risk our pension and postretirement liabilities. We've closed or ended executive retirement benefits plan where possible. In doing both last year and the first quarter, we've been taking actions to improve our funded status by approximately $1.7 billion and further de-risk our plans by an additional $1.7 billion through terminations, buyouts and lump sum offerings.
We've also been able to match our debt with our underlying business structure and believe we've made our balance sheet and P&L well protected against currency volatility. 
Going forward, we remain confident in reducing leverage from roughly 4x net debt to rolling 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 to less than 3x over the medium term.
In addition to grow EBITDA, 3 factors will also help us to get there. One important step will be refinance our preferred stock when it becomes redeemable in June. At current interest rates, we expect these will be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective. Second, we continue to expect to pay down $2 billion of debt by July 2017. And third, we aren't planning to commence any common stock repurchase until at least July 2017. 
Overall, we are making good progress in balancing a conservative financial policy while remaining committed to a strong dividend payout.
That brings us to Slide 10 in our outlook. First, we remain on track or ahead in each of the 3 areas of our integration program: organization structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. All our targets remained the same, savings and costs to achieve. We continue to target cost savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, fully realized in 2017. And we will still anticipate $1.9 billion of pretax P&L costs, including $1.1 billion in cash. Through Q1, we've been taking roughly $1.1 billion or just over half of the total P&L costs, including roughly $700 million or 65% of our likely cash expense. On the capital expenditure side, we continue to anticipate $1.1 billion of CapEx from the integration program. To date, integration-related CapEx has been just over $300 million or roughly 30% of the CapEx spend we are anticipating. But keep in mind that integration-related CapEx is in addition to the 2.5% to 3% of net sales we expect to spend on an ongoing basis.
As far as our 2016 outlook goes, based on our results through Q1, we remain confident that we will make meaningful progress this year towards our goal of achieving best-in-class margins. That being said, as I mentioned earlier, pricing is likely to be more in line with key commodity costs going forward. And faster ZBB savings will give way to organizational structure savings beginning to lap around September.
By contrast, we expect to see stronger EPS in the second half of the year due to expected earnings accretion from refinancing our preferred stock in June. 
That's our current expectation from a financial perspective, but we have significant work ahead of us to realize our potential. We have additional Big Bets to launch as the year progresses, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of both Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. We are also ramping up our IT and supply chain footprint activities significantly, and we are highly aware that, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. And making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis throughout the year.
Kraft Heinz is in a good position to unleash profitable growth, but as Bernardo said on our last call, it's also a time of significant challenges for the Kraft Heinz Company.

It's innovation to our Big Bets strategy, more marketing expenditures and building the go-to-market capabilities. And if you see what's happening in the company, it's actually the opposite. If you see marketing expenditures going up, selling expenditures going up, and the Big Bets are coming at a faster pace. So there are a lot of challenge in our categories.

And this is -- the fact is that the major big -- the major and big holiday week where sales for us completely spiked in consumption. And many times, they fall in different quarters to where the shipment goes. So your question is very good about, okay, how we can quantify that. The best way to look at it is about 20% of our business doesn't come from measured channels. So the rest, you can see the scanned data, the way we see it. That business for us in Q1 grew at around low to mid-single digits, and we expect to continue seeing positive outlook on that business. The other 2, one of the more is completely one-off. We launched 4 Big Bets in Q1. So we had one-off pipeline that would have a neutral effect moving forward, and one was timing of shipments between Q1 and Q2 that we'll see some of it reversing."

Even accounting for some of these things like pipeline fill and whatnot in the first quarter, it kind of seems like maybe organic sales were maybe more than stable. In other words, you didn't have any big disruptions, and perhaps organic sales were, give or take, still flattish or so.

If you look back for the last number of years, it came from inflation, and that inflation was based on commodities inflation. Now we are living in an environment where there is no inflation in commodities, so it is harder to be able to say -- to have a bullish approach to growth. What we said and we will continue to maintain that we would have a stable top line.

As expec",782,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Here we are again. It seems like only a few weeks ago we were reviewing Q4 results. Last call, we gave our agenda for 2016. So how are we doing so far? 
We are off to a good start, good, not great. As expected, some headwinds hung around, including consumption trends in some key categories that held us back. 
On our last call, we spoke about plans to address categories such as U.K. soup, U.S. Mac & Cheese, ready-to-drink beverage and frozen nutritional meals. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance as the year unfolds, they held back our results in Q1. 
At the same time, our emphasis on profitable sales growth is paying off. Our market share trends are improving behind innovation and marketing investments. For instance, investments we have made in our global ketchup franchise are leading category growth in the U.S., Canada and Europe and driving strong growth for us in developing markets.
In Europe, outside our U.K. soup, the rest of the portfolio is improving share performance in a challenging consumer and retail environment. And we are seeing good gains from investment in the Rest of the World, pasta sauce in Latin America, soy sauce in China and soups and mayo in Australia.
We're also able to improve our sales and go-to-market execution in what remains a challenging retail environment. For instance, our case fill rate in United States was 98%. Europe was above target at more than 99%. And Canada achieved, for the first time, 97%.
Why is this so important? As we implement our manufacturing footprint initiatives, we are trying to keep our focus in 2 areas, customer service, where we had a good performance with our customers, which is shown by increased service levels in the quarter. In fact, we're already becoming the benchmark for customer service in some key categories. And second, product quality, where I'm pleased to report progress in the quarter but with a lot of work still to be done.
Regarding the integration program, I'm also happy to report that our savings are coming faster than we were expecting, roughly $225 million in Q1. Paulo will speak more about where we stand with the overall program later. But faster progress towards our goal to achieve best-in-class margins allowed us to invest with greater confidence as we lay the groundwork for future growth.
Our Big Bet launches are starting to gain traction in the marketplace, and we have more to come. George will talk about our strong pipeline for U.S. Big Bet. 
In Europe, we continue to go after the opportunity to grow condiments and sauces with the March launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in the U.K., Spain, Italy and Germany. In Italy, we launched Plasmon Nutrimune, which contains a proprietary function ingredient that significantly improves babies' immune system. And in both Europe and North America, we're beginning to go after whitespace opportunities in foodservice.
Finally, we took further steps to bring our performance-driven culture to life. As part of our MBO process, management by objectives process, first quarter performance appraisals are going well. We now have 6,000 employees worldwide who have MBOs, up from 3,000 at this point last year. 
So overall, good operation progress that we expect to lead to better execution and profitable growth going forward.
But let's turn to Slide 3 to see what it means for our Q1 financial results. On the top line, while we saw less foreign exchange drag than Q3 and Q4 last year, it was still a 4.5% headwind on Q1 results. That being said, we had a solid organic net sales performance, up 1.1%, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and price. Pricing was up 0.3% points, reflecting gains in most segments despite deflation in key commodities in United States and Canada. Volume/mix was up 0.8% points, reflecting growth in, first, condiments and sauces globally with particular strength in developing markets; second, Lunchables and P3 in U.S.; and finally, foodservice expansion in United States.
At EBITDA, we drove strong dollar growth and margin performance, both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4 despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. This was driven by a combination of our strong cost savings performance, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior year and profitable top line growth.
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 37.7% versus the year-ago period to $0.73, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Now I will hand over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reporting segment and what we expect going forward. George?"

Overall, we are encouraged by our U.S. results so far this year as it reflects steady commercial execution in a year of transformation. In the first quarter, we had a mix of positive and negative we have seen before. We have continued our momentum from investments in Heinz Ketchup and Mustard, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Lunchables and P3 and ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts. At the same time, consumption and shared challenges in ready-to-drink beverages, Mac & Cheese, frozen nutritional meals and salad dressings remain, and I will mention what we are doing about it in a moment. 
We did deliver sequentially stronger organic growth in Q1, although you will note that our growth was above consumption, which you would have seen in our first quarter scanner data. This was due to 3 factors. First, we saw solid growth in our foodservice business and nontraditional retail channels like club and dollar stores. This is consistent with the business development or whitespace opportunities I mentioned on our last call. Much of it has been enabled by the combination of the Kraft and Heinz foodservice teams, and we should continue growing in coming quarters.
The other 2 factors were new product pipelines filled from our solid innovation agenda and shipment timing between quarters, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. 
We also saw our cost-saving initiatives pick up pace sequentially from Q4. This is from ZBB and procurement savings, adding momentum to the organizational structure savings we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. It positions us well as we ramp up modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint and continue to invest behind our brand and Big Bet over the rest of the year.
I hope you have seen some of our advertising already, but our Big Bets activities are beginning to gain some traction in the marketplace with more activities to come. For example, the launch of our Kraft Mac & Cheese renovation has been well received by consumers, and we supplemented that with the launch of new premium Mac & Cheese under the Cracker Barrel brand in the same category. 
We launched Capri Sun Organic and renovated our Kool-Aid Jammers product with fewer calories and no preservatives. We added a new line of premium pasta sauces under the Classico Riserva brand made with no artificial ingredients or added sugar. We strengthened our BBQ sauces business by adding new line under the Heinz brand, betting on consumer regional preferences in this category. And we added new lines to our salad dressing business, including new packaging format.
It's very early days, and we are not claiming victory in any category. But to the extent we can prove the trend-bending ability of our Big Bets, it's not only good for Kraft Heinz, it's good for the center of the store in general. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our prepared comments."

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on U.S. Q1 financials. Within organic growth, pricing was flat, reflecting pricing against -- across most categories despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Flat volume/mix mainly reflected innovation in Lunchables and P3, the foodservice gains and shipment timing George discussed and gains in coffee that were partially offset by lower shipments of ready-to-drink beverage, where we were up against a pre-price increase buying with Capri Sun last year as well as lower consumption of bacon and frozen nutritional meals. The Easter holiday shift did not play a significant role versus last year. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, this was driven by integration program savings as well as 2 other factors. One was favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs and the fact that we were comparing against a Q1 last year where the Kraft business saw pricing trail the impact of key commodity costs.
While we've seen a similar benefit for the past couple of quarters, we expect the pricing to be more in line with key commodities costs as we move forward. The other factor, an offset impact, was unfavorable volume declines in ready-to-drink beverages and frozen nutritional meals. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about the key factors impacting Canada in the first quarter. In Canada, we continued to see strong currency headwinds, but the negative 10 percentage point impact from currency was slightly less intense than what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year. Organically, we delivered sequentially better sales performance with pricing gains exceeding the related decline in volume/mix.
As we said on the last call, heading into 2016, we were facing challenges to increase prices in order to offset higher input costs in local currency terms. As a result, we saw positive pricing of 3.7% despite headwinds related to deflation in selected key commodities.
Volume/mix went down 2.2 percentage points as solid growth in condiments and sauces was more than offset by a decline in cheese due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q1 last year as well as lower coffee and foodservice shipments.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 33.6% versus the year-ago period despite a negative 14.2-percentage-point impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.
Overall, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this Q1 in Canada. However, I would note that some of the Q1 upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus declining commodity costs. As a result, we will not expect our EBITDA margins in Canada to continue at that level seen in Q1 as price levels are expected to be more consistent with the key commodity costs in coming quarters. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. In contrast to Q1 profitability in Canada being better than we would expect for the balance of the year, we expect the balance of the year in Europe to be progressively better than what we saw in Q1. While we saw sequential improvement in Europe's organic sales performance in Q1, including an improving volume/mix trend, it was still down and down largely due to higher promotional spending versus the prior year. The increase in promotional spending was due to 2 factors: first was a return to more normal promotional frequencies in U.K. beans versus the prior year. And as a result, we saw a solid lift in U.K. bean volume. 
The second factor affecting pricing was the Q1 infusion of promotional spending in U.K. soup to address distribution losses from Q4 programming execution. While this led to a solid March performance, our January and February results were much more like what we saw in Q4, made worse by the fact we were at high of the soup season.
This, along with the lower shipments of infant nutrition in U.K. and Italy, led to a volume/mix decline of 0.8 percentage points and offset both the solid volume gains in U.K. beans as well as ongoing growth in condiments and sauces across Europe.
Constant currency EBITDA also went down versus prior year, and margins were less, both sequentially and versus prior year. Again, this was primarily due to investments in pricing to defend U.K. soup as well as weaker category consumption in that category.
We also had higher marketing costs versus prior year in Q1, driven by investments behind Big Bet, but coming ahead of growth from this initiatives that we expect late in the year.
In the end, we feel better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, and are continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, we saw slightly less foreign currency drag in Q1 versus Q3 and Q4 but still over 25%, mainly due to recognized devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015. 
In terms of organic growth, we saw greater organic sales growth for the second quarter in a row driven by a good balance of volume/mix and price. 
Pricing of 2.1% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix went up 8.3 percentage points due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions as well as strong beverage growth in Indonesia versus the prior year period. But I would note that the Indonesian beverage growth was mainly due to earlier Ramadan shipments, so we will give back part of this favorability in Q2. 
At EBITDA, we saw a 12.1% decline in adjusted EBITDA due to a negative 38.2 percentage point impact from currency, 29.5 percentage points of which was from Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q1, driven almost exclusively by volume gains and mix improvement. 
That covers our Q1 results. Before we go to Q&A, I want to quickly provide an update on 2 areas: our capital structure and our expectations for the balance of 2016. 
I will start with capital structure on Slide 9. I think it's important to recognize the significant steps we've taken and plan to take to strengthen our capital structure. As you may have seen in our 10-K, we've taken steps to reduce and de-risk our pension and postretirement liabilities. We've closed or ended executive retirement benefits plan where possible. In doing both last year and the first quarter, we've been taking actions to improve our funded status by approximately $1.7 billion and further de-risk our plans by an additional $1.7 billion through terminations, buyouts and lump sum offerings.
We've also been able to match our debt with our underlying business structure and believe we've made our balance sheet and P&L well protected against currency volatility. 
Going forward, we remain confident in reducing leverage from roughly 4x net debt to rolling 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 to less than 3x over the medium term.
In addition to grow EBITDA, 3 factors will also help us to get there. One important step will be refinance our preferred stock when it becomes redeemable in June. At current interest rates, we expect these will be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective. Second, we continue to expect to pay down $2 billion of debt by July 2017. And third, we aren't planning to commence any common stock repurchase until at least July 2017. 
Overall, we are making good progress in balancing a conservative financial policy while remaining committed to a strong dividend payout.
That brings us to Slide 10 in our outlook. First, we remain on track or ahead in each of the 3 areas of our integration program: organization structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. All our targets remain the same, savings and costs to achieve. We continue to target cost savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, fully realized in 2017. And we will still anticipate $1.9 billion of pretax P&L costs, including $1.1 billion in cash. Through Q1, we've been taking roughly $1.1 billion or just over half of the total P&L costs, including roughly $700 million or 65% of our likely cash expense. On the capital expenditure side, we continue to anticipate $1.1 billion of CapEx from the integration program. To date, integration-related CapEx has been just over $300 million or roughly 30% of the CapEx spend we are anticipating. But keep in mind that integration-related CapEx is in addition to the 2.5% to 3% of net sales we expect to spend on an ongoing basis.
As far as our 2016 outlook goes, based on our results through Q1, we remain confident that we will make meaningful progress this year towards our goal of achieving best-in-class margins. That being said, as I mentioned earlier, pricing is likely to be more in line with key commodity costs going forward. And faster ZBB savings will give way to organizational structure savings beginning to lap around September.
By contrast, we expect to see stronger EPS in the second half of the year due to expected earnings accretion from refinancing our preferred stock in June. 
That's our current expectation from a financial perspective, but we have significant work ahead of us to realize our potential. We have additional Big Bets to launch as the year progresses, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of both Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. We are also ramping up our IT and supply chain footprint activities significantly, and we are highly aware that, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. And making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis throughout the year.
Kraft Heinz is in a good position to unleash profitable growth, but as Bernardo said on our last call, it's also a time of significant challenges for the Kraft Heinz Company.

If you see marketing expenditures going up, selling expenditures going up, and the Big Bets are coming at a faster pace. So there are a lot of challenge in our categories.

We're really overperforming the categories like ketchup, mustard, pasta sauces, cheeses, Planters, single-serve coffee.

I think where we are underperforming is largely sometimes we are missing the mark from a consumer trends point of view rather than having a different business model. Our business model applies to all categories similarly. So from a relationship with retailers, we believe we have a very strong relationship. We have a positive relationship, and we see a positive outlook there. The most important thing between us and our retailers and in my discussion with many of them was whether we can maintain the service level up or not. And we have demonstrated, not only we can maintain the service level and the case fill rate, but we actually increased it, and we feel good about that."

That business for us in Q1 grew at around low to mid-single digits, and we expect to continue seeing positive outlook on that business. The other 2, one of them was completely one-off.

If you look back for the last number of years, it came from inflation, and that inflation was based on commodities inflation. Now we are living in an environment where there is no inflation in commodities, so it is harder to be able to say -- to have a bullish approach to growth.

While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. L",1163,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. 
Let me turn to our 3 objectives of our strategy, which we laid out at the beginning of our merger: first, deliver profitable sales growth; second, achieve and maintain best-in-class margins; and third, capture a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
On our last call, I said that we are off to a good start. Good, not great. And I think that's how I should describe the first half of the year as well. It's true when you look at our top line performance and our progress in delivering profitable sales growth. The investments we have made in our global franchise continue to improve category growth or market share gains in the United States, Canada and Europe. It's also the primary driver of the nearly 9% organic sales growth in our rest of the world segment during the first 6 months of 2016. Our Big Bet investments in whitespace initiatives are starting to gain traction in markets around the globe, and we have more to talk about in the second half. George will talk about our performance in the West, including the impact of our Mac & Cheese renovation. 
Outside the U.S., the March launch of Heinz series good mayonnaise was able to help us grow our business and our market share in every market where we have put it on the shelf. These Big Bets and new products are critical for us, given the consumption headwinds in a number of markets and in a number of key categories. 
As an industry, we are in an environment where we see competition has intensified in our biggest and most mature markets, including the United States, Canada, the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia. Nowhere this is more true than in the U.K., where key category declines have been a significant drag in the first half, even though our market share trends have been improving. In this market, we must remain disciplined with our go-to-market activities, constantly balancing price, promotion and distribution while we innovate to build our brands and drive profitable growth. And as we have seen, this sometimes leads to a bumpy ride on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
Plus our, biggest challenge remained the fact that we continue to have a number of categories where consumption trends are working against us. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance going forward, our organic sales growth during the first half of the year was held back. 
Specifically, in 2 of our biggest segments, we were down on an organic basis, down [indiscernible] 1% for the first half in the United States and down 3% in Europe, resulting in 0.3% total company organic growth for the first 6 months. So as far as top line goes, like I said, okay, not great. 
In terms of our second objective to achieve best-in-class in margins, we have made significant progress in the first 6 months of the year, with adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 20% or just over 25% on a constant currency basis. This has been driven by a combination of savings for our integration program, commodities probability in North America as well as strong organic sales growth in the rest of the world segment. 
In terms of our integration program, we delivered roughly $300 million of savings in Q2. But I am even happier to report that in Q2, we put a critical step behind us, one of the more risky activities we have in our agenda. That was the integration of the legacy Kraft and the legacy Heinz front office SAP models in North America. 
So now we are one face to our customers as a system-integrated company. And we did this while keeping our case rate in the United States on target at 98%, with minor service issues in foodservice already addressed. In fact, we had very good execution around the world in Q2, with Europe remaining above its case rate target and more than 99% Canada and 97% in our rest of the world segment for the first time above 96%. Importantly, none of this would be possible without bringing our performance-driven culture to life. 
I noted on our last call that our manageable objectives, our MBO process now covers roughly 6,000 employees worldwide. In Q2, we took another important step, launching our own diversity, a new global learning platform to support our culture, accelerate our vision and values and help employees constantly deliver on our MBOs. Kraft Heinz University provides a consistent training foundation across the organization. 
Last but not least, as part of our third objective, we have taken significant further actions to deliver a superior return of capital and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may have seen, during Q2, recall the redemption and refinancing of our preferred stock, an important step in strengthening our investment-grade credit standing. In fact, with our Q2 results, our leverage ratio is now just below 4x EBITDA based on our latest 12 months of results and are on our way to achieving the below 3x ratio we are targeting over the medium term. And finally, as you saw today, our Board of Directors set a 4.3% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. 
So overall, we have made meaningful progress against the objectives of our strategy that will help lay the foundation for better execution and profitable growth going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 3 to see what that means for Q2 financial results. On the top line, similar to Q1, we saw a ForEx exchange drag of 4%. On an organic basis, however, net sales were down 0.5%. Pricing was up 1.6 percentage points, reflecting gains in all regions but Europe, and despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada, primarily in dairy and coffee. 
Volume/mix fell 2.1 percentage points as lower shipments, particularly meat and foodservice in the United States, more than offset gains from innovation in Lunchables and P3 in the U.S. and solid volumes of condiments and sauces globally. At EBITDA, we drove a strong dollar growth and margin performance both year-over-year and sequentially from Q1 despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. This was driven by a combination of: one, our strong cost savings performance; favored pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior period; and profitable top line growth. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 39.3% versus the prior period to $0.85, reflecting the leverage of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth playing through the P&L. 
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did it in each reporting segment and what to expect going forward. George?"
278212,374877602,1025726,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States.

Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. 
If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a year of significant transformation. And so far, that's what we have done. We've been able to maintain solid momentum in the marketplace and a number of categories that we place Big Bets on, with new products as well as advertising support. This includes Heinz sauces, which grew at mid-single digits, driven by the introduction of barbecue sauce, year 2 of mustard and the shared growth of ketchup; philadelphia Cream Cheese, ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts and Lunchables, which are all growing at mid- to high single digits. However, these gains were more than offset by weak consumption trends in categories like roast-and-ground coffee, frozen nutritional meals and hotdog. 
On one hand, there are no new major categories that I would add to this list. On the other hand, we do need to move faster to adjust in the marketplace and ensure that these challenging categories do not mock [ph] the successes we are achieving with our Big Bet innovations and investments in marketing. 
Our new product initiatives for 2016 are working well, particularly the renovation of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Capri Sun ready-to-drink organic beverage, the introduction of Heinz BBQ sauces and the introduction of Mac & Cheese. 
The second factor I would highlight is that our Q2 shipments were consistent with measured channels consumption, in line with our expectation from our last call. As you may have seen, the recent Scanner data was affected by the timing of the 4th of July holiday versus the prior year. Adjusting for that, our consumption would have been down roughly 2% in the second quarter. So shipments were essentially in line with consumption. 
I would also note that we continue to add new business or whitespace in both foodservice and nontraditional retail channel during the second quarter. However, foodservice was down versus prior year in Q2 due to program timing with customers, incremental commodity-related price declines as well as minor service level problems during the quarter, which brings me to our integration program execution. 
During the quarter, the bulk of our integration activity shifted to supply chain and operation activities, including an SAP integration go live, which was completed in the quarter. Thus far, our service levels remain good for most of our product groups, with some challenges in the cold cuts segment of our meat business as well as minor disruption in foodservice in the month of May that was quickly corrected. Overall, as Bernardo mentioned, our savings are coming in faster than planned, and we are achieving these savings without sacrificing quality. 
For the balance of the year, our key objective would be twofold: first, we must continue to execute our footprint integration while minimizing disruption; second, we will step up our in-store activity, including a strong agenda of new product introduction we have planned for the second half; look for new product introductions in our desserts, cheese and frozen categories in the months ahead, which follow the rollout of our new devour frozen meal this past month. 
As I hope you can see, it is an exciting time for Kraft Heinz in the United States. Our plate is full, and our opportunity for profitable growth is significant. Our job is to deliver in the marketplace. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."
278212,374877602,1025726,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone.

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on Q2 financials in the U.S. 
With organic growth, pricing was up 1.2 percentage points, primarily due to lower promotional activity versus the prior year and despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Volume/mix fell 3.1 percentage points, reflecting ongoing gains from innovations like Lunchables and P3 and strong volumes our Mac & Cheese renovation that were more than offset by lower shipments in key categories but strongest in foodservice and, as George noted, in our meats category. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, as mentioned in our Q1 call, this was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable price relative to lower key commodity costs. 
While we've been seeing the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the past couple of quarters, we continue to expect commodities favorability to fade as we move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, where the key factors impacting Canada in the second quarter were essentially the same as what we saw in Q1.
We still saw a strong currency headwind, but the negative 5 percentage point impact from currency in Q2 was half that seen in Q1. Organically, we were able to deliver net sales growth from pricing gains exceeding the related decline in volume/mix. 
Positive pricing of 3.1% was the result of significant pricing to offset higher product costs in local currency. And this more than offset pricing headwinds related to deflation in select key commodities. 
Volume/mix went down [ph] 1.9 percentage points, primarily from a decline in cheese, due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q2 last year as well as lower coffee and ready-to-drink beverage shipments. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 27.2% versus the year-ago period despite a negative 7.2 percentage point impact from currency. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable timing of pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.
Similar to Q1, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this quarter in Canada. However, I would note that some of the upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus local input costs. 
Moving forward and with official revenue prices now on the rise in Canada, we would not expect the commodity favorability in the first half of this year to show up in coming quarters. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7.
On our last call, I said that we felt better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, specifically in terms of profitability. 
On the Q2 top line, as we saw with Q1 versus Q4, organic net sales growth was again better on a sequential basis. Organic net sales were still down and down largely due to an increase in promotional activity in U.K. condiments and sauces versus the prior year period. But our volume/mix strength kept improving, reflecting gains from condiments and sauces in most countries that were offset by lower shipments versus the prior year in the U.K. At the same time, while constant currency EBITDA in Europe was down slightly versus prior year, margins were up, both sequentially and versus the prior year. This was driven by a mix of manufacturing savings, lower pricing and an increase in market investments. 
So while we are not all the way out of the woods, the health of our European business is indeed better than our Q1 numbers might have indicated, and we are continuing to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the rest of the world on Slide 8. Here, foreign currency was again a significant headwind, roughly 24%, mainly due to recognizing the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015. 
In terms of organic growth, we saw high single-digit organic net sales growth, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and pricing. Pricing of 5% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix was up 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions.
Debt-to-EBITDA. We saw 8.8% decline in adjusted EBITDA to a negative 34.5 percentage point impact from currency, 27.5% percentage points of which was from the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q2, driven by strong organic growth. 
That covers our Q2 results. And before we go to the Q&A, I want to quickly update our expectations for our financial performance over the near to medium term. 
From an organic sales perspective, I think it's important to act on Bernardo's and George's thoughts, that is we would expect for both an interesting perspective and a Kraft Heinz perspective that consumer trends in an increasingly competitively retail environment are likely to remain headwinds in both North America and Europe. 
We remain confident in our pipeline of Big Bets, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. However, as we have all seen, our starting point in most mature markets is declining consumption. And therefore, we have much work to do to simply get back to positive organic sales growth. 
As far as our integration program, all of our targets remain the same, savings and costs to achieve. And we are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, in 2017. 
Below the line, the redemption of our preferred stock and related financing with new debt is expected to benefit EPS growth in the second half. As a result of the new debt issuance, at today's currency rates, we expect our run rate net interest expense to be approximately 3.8% of the roughly $33 billion [ph] of gross debt outstanding at the end of Q2. 
So that's our update through the second quarter of 2016. We still have significant work ahead to realize our potential and set the stage for profitable growth in the future. We have a strong Big Bets pipeline, with a strong agenda for the second half and further whitespace opportunities to go up. At the same time, our footprint integration activity is expected to reach its peak in the second half of the year as well. And as we've said before, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. Making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis for the remainder of the year. 
So while we have had a solid start to the year, we must continue to execute well against the many opportunities we have to deliver profitable growth. Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. L",1163,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. 
Let me turn to our 3 objectives of our strategy, which we laid out at the beginning of our merger: first, deliver profitable sales growth; second, achieve and maintain best-in-class margins; and third, capture a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
On our last call, I said that we are off to a good start. Good, not great. And I think that's how I should describe the first half of the year as well. It's true when you look at our top line performance in our progress in delivering profitable sales growth. The investments we have made in our global sauces franchise continued to improve category growth or market share gains in the United States, Canada and Europe. It's also the primary driver of the nearly 9% organic sales growth in our Rest of the World segment during the first 6 months of 2016. Our Big Bet investments in whitespace initiatives are starting to gain traction in markets around the globe, and you have more to talk about in the second half. George will talk about our performance in the West, including the impact of our Mac & Cheese renovation. 
Outside the U.S., the March launch of Heinz serious good mayonnaise was able to help us grow our business and our market share in every market where we have put it on the shelf. These Big Bets and new products are critical for us, given the consumption headwinds in a number of markets and in a number of key categories. 
As an industry, we are in an environment where we see competition has intensified in our biggest and most mature markets, including the United States, Canada, the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia. Nowhere this is more true than in U.K., where key category declines have been a significant drag in the first half, even though our market share trends have been improving. In this market, we must remain disciplined with our go-to-market activities, constantly balancing price, promotion and distribution, while we innovate to build our brands and drive profitable growth. And as you have seen, this sometimes leads to a bumpy ride on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
Plus our, biggest challenge remained the fact that we continue to have a number of categories where consumption trends are working against us. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance going forward, our organic sales growth during the first half of the year was held back. 
Specifically, in 2 of our biggest segments, we were down on an organic basis, down roughly 1% for the first half in the United States, and down 3% in Europe, resulting in 0.3% total company organic growth for the first 6 months. So as far as top line goes, like I said, okay, not great. 
In terms of our second objective to achieve best-in-class in margins, we have made significant progress in the first 6 months of the year, with adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 20% or just over 25% on a constant currency basis. This has been driven by a combination of savings for our integration program, commodities probability in North America as well as strong organic sales growth in the Rest of the World segment. 
In terms of our integration program, we delivered roughly $300 million of savings in Q2. But I am even happier to report that in Q2, we put a critical step behind us, one of the more risky activities we have in our agenda. That was the integration of the legacy Kraft and the legacy Heinz front office SAP models in North America. 
So now we are one face to our customers as a system-integrated company. And we did this while keeping our case rate in the United States on target at 98%, with minor service issues in foodservice already addressed. In fact, we had very good execution around the world in Q2, with Europe remaining above its case rate target and more than 99% Canada and 97% in our Rest of the World segment for the first time above 96%. Importantly, none of this would be possible without bringing our performance-driven culture to life. 
I noted on our last call that our manageable objectives, our MBO process now covers roughly 6,000 employees worldwide. In Q2, we took another important step, launching our own diversity, a new global learning platform to support our culture, accelerate our vision and values and help employees constantly deliver on our MBOs. Kraft Heinz University provides a consistent training foundation across the organization. 
Last but not least, as part of our third objective, we have taken significant further actions to deliver a superior return of capital and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may have seen, during Q2, recall the redemption and refinancing of our preferred stock, an important step in strengthening our investment-grade credit standing. 
In fact, with our Q2 results, our leverage ratio is now just below 4x EBITDA based on our latest 12 months of results and are on our way to achieving the below 3x ratio we are targeting over the medium term. And finally, as you saw today, our Board of Directors set a 4.3% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.60 per share. 
So overall, we have made meaningful progress against the objectives of our strategy that will help lay the foundation for better execution and profitable growth going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 3 to see what that means for Q2 financial results. On the top line, similar to Q1, we saw a ForEx exchange drag of 4%. On an organic basis, however, net sales were down 0.5%. Pricing was up 1.6 percentage points, reflecting gains in all regions but Europe, and despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada, primarily in dairy and coffee. 
Volume/mix fell 2.1 percentage points as lower shipments, particularly meat and foodservice in the United States, more than offset gains from innovation in Lunchables and P3 in the U.S. and solid volumes of condiments and sauces globally. At EBITDA, we drove a strong dollar growth and margin performance both year-over-year and sequentially from Q1, despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. 
This was driven by a combination of: one, our strong cost savings performance; favored pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior period; and profitable top line growth. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 39.3% versus the prior period to $0.85, reflecting the leverage of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth playing through the P&L. 
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did it in each reporting segment, and what to expect going forward. George?"
278212,374877602,1026045,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a",594,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. 
If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a year of significant transformation. And so far, that's what we have done. We've been able to maintain solid momentum in the marketplace and a number of categories that we place Big Bets on, with new products and all advertising support. This includes Heinz sauces, which grew at mid-single digits, driven by the introduction of barbecue sauce, year 2 of mustard and the shared growth of ketchup; Philadelphia Cream Cheese, ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts and Lunchables, which are all growing at mid- to high single digits. However, these gains were more than offset by weak consumption trends in categories like roast-and-ground coffee, frozen nutritional meal and hotdog. 
On one hand, there are no new major categories that I would add to this list. On the other hand, we do need to move faster to adjust in the marketplace and ensure that these challenging categories do not mask the successes we are achieving with our Big Bet innovations and investments in marketing. 
Our new product initiatives for 2016 are working well, particularly the renovation of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Capri Sun ready-to-drink organic beverage, the introduction of Heinz BBQ sauces and the introduction of Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese. 
The second factor I would highlight is that our Q2 shipments were consistent with measured channels consumption, in line with our expectation from our last call. As you may have seen, the recent Scanner data was affected by the timing of the 4th of July holiday versus the prior year. Adjusting for that, our consumption would have been down roughly 2% in the second quarter. So shipments were essentially in line with consumption.
I would also note that we continue to add new business or whitespace in both foodservice and nontraditional retail channel during the second quarter. However, foodservice was down versus prior year in Q2 due to program timing with customers, incremental commodity-related price decline as well as minor service level problems during the quarter, which brings me to our integration program execution. 
During the quarter, the bulk of our integration activity shifted to supply chain and operation activities, including an SAP integration go live, which was completed in the quarter. Thus far, our service levels remained good for most of our product groups, with some challenges in the cold cuts segment of our meat business as well as minor disruption in foodservice in the month of May that was quickly corrected. Overall, as Bernardo mentioned, our savings are coming in faster than planned, and we are achieving these savings without sacrificing quality. 
For the balance of the year, our key objective would be twofold: first, we must continue to execute our footprint integration, while minimizing disruption; second, we will step up our in-store activity, including a strong agenda of new product introduction we have planned for the second half. Look for new product introductions in our desserts, cheese and frozen categories in the months ahead, which follow the rollout of our new devour frozen meal this past month. 
As I hope you can see, it is an exciting time for Kraft Heinz in the United States. Our plate is full, and our opportunity for profitable growth is significant. Our job is to deliver in the marketplace. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on Q2 financials in the U.S. 
With organic growth, pricing was up 1.2 percentage points, primarily due to lower promotional activity versus the prior year and despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Volume/mix fell 3.1 percentage points, reflecting ongoing gains from innovations like Lunchables and P3, and strong volumes our Mac & Cheese renovation that were more than offset by lower shipments in key categories, but strongest in foodservice, and as George noted, in our meats category.
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, as mentioned in our Q1 call, this was driven by integration program savings, and to a much lesser extent, favorable price relative to lower key commodity costs. 
While we've been seeing the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the past couple of quarters, we continue to expect commodities favorability to fade as we move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, where the key factors impacting Canada in the second quarter were essentially the same as what we saw in Q1.
We still saw a strong currency headwinds, but the negative 5 percentage point impact from currency in Q2 was half that seen in Q1. Organically, we were able to deliver net sales growth from pricing gains exceeding their related decline in volume/mix. 
Positive pricing of 3.1% was the result of significant pricing to offset higher product costs in local currency. And this more than offset pricing headwinds related to deflation in select key commodities. 
Volume/mix went down 1.9 percentage points, primarily from a decline in cheese, due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q2 last year as well as lower coffee and ready-to-drink beverage shipments. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 27.2% versus the year-ago period, despite a negative 7.2 percentage point impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable timing of pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.
Similar to Q1, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this quarter in Canada. However, I would note that some of the upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus local input costs. 
Moving forward and with official revenue prices now on the rise in Canada, we would not expect the commodity favorability in the first half of this year to show up in coming quarters.
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. On our last call, I said that we felt better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, specifically in terms of profitability.
On the Q2 top line, as we saw with Q1 versus Q4, organic net sales growth was again better on a sequential basis. Organic net sales were still down and down largely due to an increase in promotional activity in U.K. condiments and sauces versus the prior year period. But our volume/mix strength kept improving, reflecting gains from condiments and sauces in most countries that were offset by lower shipments versus the prior year in the U.K. 
At the same time, while constant currency EBITDA in Europe was down slightly versus prior year, margins were up, both sequentially and versus the prior year. This was driven by a mix of manufacturing savings, lower pricing and an increase in market investments. 
So while we are not all the way out of the woods, the health of our European business is indeed better than our Q1 numbers might have indicated, and we are continuing to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, foreign currency was again a significant headwind, roughly 24%, mainly due to recognizing the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015. 
In terms of organic growth, we saw high single-digit organic net sales growth, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and pricing. Pricing of 5% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix was up 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions.
Debt-to-EBITDA. We saw 8.8% decline in adjusted EBITDA to a negative 34.5 percentage point impact from currency, 27.5% percentage points of which was from the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q2, driven by strong organic growth. 
That covers our Q2 results. And before we go to the Q&A, I want to quickly update our expectations for our financial performance over the near to medium term. 
From an organic sales perspective, I think it's important to act on Bernardo's and George's thoughts, that is we would expect from both an industry perspective and a Kraft Heinz perspective that consumer trends in an increasingly competitive retail environment are likely to remain headwinds in both North America and Europe. 
We remain confident in our pipeline of Big Bets, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. However, as you have all seen, our starting point in most mature markets is declining consumption. And therefore, we have much work to do to simply get back to positive organic sales growth. 
As far as our integration program, all of our targets remain the same, savings and cost to achieve. And we are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation in 2017. 
Below the line, the redemption of our preferred stock and related financing with new debt is expected to benefit EPS growth in the second half. As a result of the new debt issuance, at today's currency rates, we expect our run rate net interest expense to be approximately 3.8% of the roughly $33 billion of gross debt outstanding at the end of Q2. 
So that's our update through the second quarter of 2016. We still have significant work ahead to realize our potential and set the stage for profitable growth in the future. We have a strong Big Bet pipeline, with a strong agenda for the second half and further whitespace opportunities to go after. At the same time, our footprint integration activity is expected to reach its peak in the second half of the year as well. And as we've said before, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. Making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis for the remainder of the year.
So while we have had a solid start to the year, we must continue to execute well against the many opportunities we have to deliver profitable growth. 
Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

The majority of the work in ZBB savings, they are already implemented, although we are still expecting some more savings coming from the ZBB bucket. And again, going forward, the majority of the savings that we expect from our plans, for our plans, will come from the footprint initiatives that we have. That being said, I think it's important to keep in mind that these savings, they should also offset the expected inflation that we have for the following year. Our target is $1.5 billion, net of inflation, for 2017. And again, we will continue to update our expectations every quarter, but no change in our estimate so far."

The Big Bets that we launched this year, they were in the former companies independently worked on, and we launched in Q1 and Q2. They weren't affected by any disruption from the integration. The 3 big ones for us this year have been the Heinz BBQ sauces, which was launched early this year and it's doing very well; the Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese, also another premium one, so it had a significant premium to the Kraft Mac & Cheese. And it is our best-selling 1/2 of the new product development; and Capri Sun Organic. To put something like this, it takes at least 12 months. So they all started pre and during -- and worked on during the merger. We also launched a new brand called Devour, just launched it in the marketplace in frozen meals segment. And that was done about 2 months ago. And that was project that we started in late last year. So that happened after the merger.

While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. L",1160,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. 
Let me turn to our 3 objectives of our strategy, which we laid out at the beginning of our merger: first, deliver profitable sales growth; second, achieve and maintain best-in-class margins; and third, capture a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
On our last call, I said that we are off to a good start. Good, not great. And I think that's how I should describe the first half of the year as well. It's true when you look at our top line performance in our progress in delivering profitable sales growth. The investments we have made in our global sauces franchise continued to improve category growth or market share gains in the United States, Canada and Europe. It's also the primary driver of the nearly 9% organic sales growth in our Rest of the World segment during the first 6 months of 2016. Our Big Bet investments and whitespace initiatives are starting to gain traction in markets around the globe, and we'll have more to talk about in the second half. George will talk about our performance in the West, including the impact of our Mac & Cheese renovation. 
Outside the U.S., the March launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise was able to help us grow our business and our market share in every market where we have put it on the shelf. These Big Bets and new products are critical for us, given the consumption headwinds in a number of markets and in a number of key categories. 
As an industry, we are in an environment where we see competition has intensified in our biggest and most mature markets, including the United States, Canada, the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia. Nowhere this is more true than in U.K., where key category declines have been a significant drag in the first half, even though our market share trends have been improving. In this market, we must remain disciplined with our go-to-market activities, constantly balancing price, promotion and distribution, while we innovate to build our brands and drive profitable growth. And as we have seen, this sometimes leads to a bumpy ride on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
Plus our, biggest challenge remains the fact that you continue to have a number of categories where consumption trends are working against us. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance going forward, our organic sales growth during the first half of the year was held back. 
Specifically, in 2 of our biggest segments, we were down on an organic basis, down roughly 1% for the first half in the United States, and down 3% in Europe, resulting in 0.3% total company organic growth for the first 6 months. So as far as top line goes, like I said, ""okay, not great.""
In terms of our second objective to achieve best-in-class in margins, we have made significant progress in the first 6 months of the year, with adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 20% or just over 25% on a constant currency basis. This has been driven by a combination of savings for our integration program, commodities favorability in North America as well as strong organic sales growth in the Rest of the World segment. 
In terms of our integration program, we delivered roughly $300 million of savings in Q2. But I am even happier to report that in Q2, we put a critical step behind us, one of the more risky activities we have in our agenda. That was the integration of legacy Kraft and legacy Heinz front office SAP models in North America. 
So now we are one face to our customers as a system-integrated company. And we did this while keeping our case rate in the United States on target at 98%, with minor service issues in Foodservice already addressed. In fact, we had very good execution around the world in Q2, with Europe remaining above its case rate target and more than 99% Canada and 97% in our Rest of the World segment for the first time above 96%. Importantly, none of this would be possible without bringing our performance-driven culture to life. 
I noted on our last call that our manageable objectives, our MBO process now covers roughly 6,000 employees worldwide. In Q2, we took another important step, launching our own university, a new global learning platform to support our culture, accelerate our vision and values and help employees constantly deliver on our MBOs. Kraft Heinz University provides a consistent training foundation across the organization. 
Last but not least, as part of our third objective, we have taken significant further actions to deliver a superior return of capital and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may have seen, during Q2, recall the redemption and refinancing of our preferred stock, an important step in strengthening our investment-grade credit standing. 
In fact, with our Q2 results, our leverage ratio is now just below 4x EBITDA based on our latest 12 months of results and are on our way to achieving the below 3x ratio we are targeting over the medium term. And finally, as you saw today, our Board of Directors set a 4.3% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.60 per share. 
So overall, we have made meaningful progress against the objectives of our strategy that will help lay the foundation for better execution and profitable growth going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 3 to see what that means for Q2 financial results. On the top line, similar to Q1, we saw a ForEx drag of 4%. On an organic basis, however, net sales were down 0.5%. Pricing was up 1.6 percentage points, reflecting gains in all regions but Europe, and despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada, primarily in dairy and coffee. 
Volume/mix fell 2.1 percentage points as lower shipments, particularly meat and Foodservice in the United States, more than offset gains from innovation in Lunchables and P3 in the U.S. and solid volumes of condiments and sauces globally. At EBITDA, we drove a strong dollar growth and margin performance both year-over-year and sequentially from Q1, despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. 
This was driven by a combination of: one, our strong cost savings performance; favored pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior period; and profitable top line growth. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 39.3% versus the prior period to $0.85, reflecting the leverage of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth playing through the P&L. 
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did it in each reporting segment, and what to expect going forward. George?"

Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a",594,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. 
If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a year of significant transformation. And so far, that's what we have done. We've been able to maintain solid momentum in the marketplace, in a number of categories that we place Big Bets on, with new products and all advertising support. This includes Heinz sauces, which grew at mid-single digits, driven by the introduction of barbecue sauce, year 2 of mustard and the share growth of ketchup; Philadelphia Cream Cheese, ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts and Lunchables, which are all growing at mid- to high single digits. However, these gains were more than offset by weak consumption trends in categories like roast-and-ground coffee, frozen nutritional meals and hotdog. 
On one hand, there are no new major categories that I would add to this list. On the other hand, we do need to move faster to adjust in the marketplace and ensure that these challenging categories do not mask the successes we are achieving with our Big Bet innovations and investments in marketing. 
Our new product initiatives for 2016 are working well, particularly the renovation of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Capri Sun ready-to-drink organic beverage, the introduction of Heinz BBQ sauces and the introduction of Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese. 
The second factor I would highlight is that our Q2 shipments were consistent with measured channels consumption, in line with our expectation from our last call. As you may have seen, the recent Scanner data was affected by the timing of the 4th of July holiday versus the prior year. Adjusting for that, our consumption would have been down roughly 2% in the second quarter. So shipments were essentially in line with consumption.
I would also note that we continue to add new business or whitespace in both Foodservice and nontraditional retail channel during the second quarter. However, Foodservice was down versus prior year in Q2 due to program timing with customers, incremental commodity-related price decline as well as minor service level problems during the quarter, which brings me to our integration program execution. 
During the quarter, the bulk of our integration activity shifted to supply chain and operation activities, including an SAP integration go live, which was completed in the quarter. Thus far, our service levels remained good for most of our product groups, with some challenges in the cold cuts segment of our meat business as well as minor disruption in Foodservice in the month of May that was quickly corrected. Overall, as Bernardo mentioned, our savings are coming in faster than planned, and we are achieving these savings without sacrificing quality. 
For the balance of the year, our key objective would be twofold: first, we must continue to execute our footprint integration, while minimizing disruption; second, we will step up our in-store activity, including a strong agenda of new product introduction we have planned for the second half. 
Look for new product introductions in our desserts, cheese and frozen categories in the months ahead, which follow the rollout of our new Devour frozen meals this past month. 
As I hope you can see, it is an exciting time for Kraft Heinz in the United States. Our plate is full, and our opportunity for profitable growth is significant. Our job is to deliver in the marketplace. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on Q2 financials in the U.S. 
With organic growth, pricing was up 1.2 percentage points, primarily due to lower promotional activity versus the prior year and despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Volume/mix fell 3.1 percentage points, reflecting ongoing gains from innovations like Lunchables and P3, and strong volumes from our Mac & Cheese renovation that were more than offset by lower shipments in key categories, but strongest in Foodservice, and as George noted, in our meats category.
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, as mentioned in our Q1 call, this was driven by integration program savings, and to a much lesser extent, favorable price relative to lower key commodity costs. 
While we've been seeing the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the past couple of quarters, we continue to expect commodities favorability to fade as we move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, where the key factors impacting Canada in the second quarter were essentially the same as what we saw in Q1.
We still saw strong currency headwinds, but the negative 5 percentage point impact from currency in Q2 was half that seen in Q1. Organically, we were able to deliver net sales growth from pricing gains exceeding their related decline in volume/mix. 
Positive pricing of 3.1% was the result of significant pricing to offset higher product costs in local currency. And this more than offset pricing headwinds related to deflation in select key commodities. 
Volume/mix went down 1.9 percentage points, primarily from a decline in cheese, due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q2 last year as well as lower coffee and ready-to-drink beverage shipments. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 27.2% versus the year-ago period, despite a negative 7.2 percentage point impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable timing of pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.
Similar to Q1, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this quarter in Canada. However, I would note that some of the upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus local input costs. 
Moving forward and with official raw milk prices now on the rise in Canada, we would not expect the commodity favorability in the first half of this year to show up in coming quarters.
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. On our last call, I said that we felt better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, specifically in terms of profitability.
On the Q2 top line, as we saw with Q1 versus Q4, organic net sales growth was again better on a sequential basis. Organic net sales were still down and down largely due to an increase in promotional activity in U.K. condiments and sauces versus the prior year period. But our volume/mix strength kept improving, reflecting gains from condiments and sauces in most countries that were offset by lower shipments versus the prior year in the U.K. 
At the same time, while constant currency EBITDA in Europe was down slightly versus prior year, margins were up, both sequentially and versus the prior year. This was driven by a mix of manufacturing savings, lower pricing and an increase in market investments. 
So while we are not all the way out of the woods, the health of our European business is indeed better than our Q1 numbers might have indicated, and we are continuing to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, foreign currency was again a significant headwind, roughly 24%, mainly due to recognizing the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015. 
In terms of organic growth, we saw high single-digit organic net sales growth, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and pricing. Pricing of 5% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix was up 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions.
Debt-to-EBITDA. We saw 8.8% decline in adjusted EBITDA to a negative 34.5 percentage point impact from currency, 27.5% percentage points of which was from the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q2, driven by strong organic growth. 
That covers our Q2 results. And before we go to the Q&A, I want to quickly update our expectations for our financial performance over the near to medium term. 
From an organic sales perspective, I think it's important to echo Bernardo's and George's thoughts, that is we would expect from both an industry perspective and a Kraft Heinz perspective that consumer trends in an increasingly competitive retail environment are likely to remain headwinds in both North America and Europe. 
We remain confident in our pipeline of Big Bets, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both Foodservice and international channels. However, as you have all seen, our starting point in most mature markets is declining consumption. And therefore, we have much work to do to simply get back to positive organic sales growth. 
As far as our integration program, all of our targets remain the same, savings and cost to achieve. And we are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation in 2017. 
Below the line, the redemption of our preferred stock and related financing with new debt is expected to benefit EPS growth in the second half. As a result of the new debt issuance, at today's currency rates, we expect our run rate net interest expense to be approximately 3.8% of the roughly $33 billion of gross debt outstanding at the end of Q2. 
So that's our update through the second quarter of 2016. We still have significant work ahead to realize our potential and set the stage for profitable growth in the future. We have a strong Big Bet pipeline, with a strong agenda for the second half and further whitespace opportunities to go after. At the same time, our footprint integration activity is expected to reach its peak in the second half of the year as well. And as we've said before, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. Making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis for the remainder of the year.
So while we have had a solid start to the year, we must continue to execute well against the many opportunities we have to deliver profitable growth. 
Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

I will answer your question on the environment, and I will pass it on to Bernardo to follow up the second part of the question. The challenging environment is nothing new. However, it accelerated a little bit over the past 12 months or so. And the way we are dealing with that is by investing more in a new product development program, in line with where our consumer trends are now and where they are going in the future. And we're increasing our investment and supporting our big brands. This is the best way to deal with consumers. The one thing we're not doing is throwing money to try to get quick sales. We are resisting that temptation. And we believe it's better for us in the long term to invest in sustainable growth. As for the second part of the question, I'll pass it on to Bernardo."

The Big Bets that we launched this year, they were in the former companies independently worked on, and we launched them in Q1 and Q2. They weren't affected by any disruption from the integration. The 3 big ones for us this year have been the Heinz BBQ sauces, which was launched early this year and it's doing very well; the Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese, also another premium one, selling at a significant premium to the Kraft Mac & Cheese -- and it is our best-selling one out of the new product development; and Capri Sun Organic. To put something like this, it takes at least 12 months. So they all started pre -- and worked on during the merger. We also launched a new brand called Devour, just launched it in the marketplace in frozen meals segment. And that was done about 2 months ago. And that was a project that we started in late last year. So that happened after the merger.

It moved from the double digits that we all used to see to mid-single digit growth. And that is a very healthy category. And as you know, we innovated greatly in this category over the past few years, and we continue to do so. In roast-and-ground, the category has been in persistent decline for quite some time, as consumers are moving into the more premium and the pods business.

While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. L",1160,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. While much of today's call will concentrate on second quarter numbers, I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have made to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year. 
Let me turn to our 3 objectives of our strategy, which we laid out at the beginning of our merger: first, deliver profitable sales growth; second, achieve and maintain best-in-class margins; and third, capture a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. 
On our last call, I said that we are off to a good start. Good, not great. And I think that's how I should describe the first half of the year as well. It's true when you look at our top line performance in our progress in delivering profitable sales growth. The investments we have made in our global sauces franchise continued to improve category growth or market share gains in the United States, Canada and Europe. It's also the primary driver of the nearly 9% organic sales growth in our Rest of the World segment during the first 6 months of 2016. Our Big Bet investments and whitespace initiatives are starting to gain traction in markets around the globe, and we'll have more to talk about in the second half. George will talk about our performance in the West, including the impact of our Mac & Cheese renovation. 
Outside the U.S., the March launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise was able to help us grow our business and our market share in every market where we have put it on the shelf. These Big Bets and new products are critical for us, given the consumption headwinds in a number of markets and in a number of key categories. 
As an industry, we are in an environment where we see competition has intensified in our biggest and most mature markets, including the United States, Canada, the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia. Nowhere this is more true than in U.K., where key category declines have been a significant drag in the first half, even though our market share trends have been improving. In this market, we must remain disciplined with our go-to-market activities, constantly balancing price, promotion and distribution, while we innovate to build our brands and drive profitable growth. And as we have seen, this sometimes leads to a bumpy ride on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
Plus our, biggest challenge remains the fact that you continue to have a number of categories where consumption trends are working against us. And while we are making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance going forward, our organic sales growth during the first half of the year was held back. 
Specifically, in 2 of our biggest segments, we were down on an organic basis, down roughly 1% for the first half in the United States, and down 3% in Europe, resulting in 0.3% total company organic growth for the first 6 months. So as far as top line goes, like I said, ""okay, not great.""
In terms of our second objective to achieve best-in-class in margins, we have made significant progress in the first 6 months of the year, with adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 20% or just over 25% on a constant currency basis. This has been driven by a combination of savings for our integration program, commodities favorability in North America as well as strong organic sales growth in the Rest of the World segment. 
In terms of our integration program, we delivered roughly $300 million of savings in Q2. But I am even happier to report that in Q2, we put a critical step behind us, one of the more risky activities we have in our agenda. That was the integration of legacy Kraft and legacy Heinz front office SAP models in North America. 
So now we are one face to our customers as a system-integrated company. And we did this while keeping our case rate in the United States on target at 98%, with minor service issues in Foodservice already addressed. In fact, we had very good execution around the world in Q2, with Europe remaining above its case rate target and more than 99% Canada and 97% in our Rest of the World segment for the first time above 96%. Importantly, none of this would be possible without bringing our performance-driven culture to life. 
I noted on our last call that our manageable objectives, our MBO process now covers roughly 6,000 employees worldwide. In Q2, we took another important step, launching our own university, a new global learning platform to support our culture, accelerate our vision and values and help employees constantly deliver on our MBOs. Kraft Heinz University provides a consistent training foundation across the organization. 
Last but not least, as part of our third objective, we have taken significant further actions to deliver a superior return of capital and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may have seen, during Q2, recall the redemption and refinancing of our preferred stock, an important step in strengthening our investment-grade credit standing. 
In fact, with our Q2 results, our leverage ratio is now just below 4x EBITDA based on our latest 12 months of results and are on our way to achieving the below 3x ratio we are targeting over the medium term. And finally, as you saw today, our Board of Directors set a 4.3% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.60 per share. 
So overall, we have made meaningful progress against the objectives of our strategy that will help lay the foundation for better execution and profitable growth going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 3 to see what that means for Q2 financial results. On the top line, similar to Q1, we saw a ForEx drag of 4%. On an organic basis, however, net sales were down 0.5%. Pricing was up 1.6 percentage points, reflecting gains in all regions but Europe, and despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada, primarily in dairy and coffee. 
Volume/mix fell 2.1 percentage points as lower shipments, particularly meat and Foodservice in the United States, more than offset gains from innovation in Lunchables and P3 in the U.S. and solid volumes of condiments and sauces globally. At EBITDA, we drove a strong dollar growth and margin performance both year-over-year and sequentially from Q1, despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. 
This was driven by a combination of: one, our strong cost savings performance; favored pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior period; and profitable top line growth. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 39.3% versus the prior period to $0.85, reflecting the leverage of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth playing through the P&L. 
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did it in each reporting segment, and what to expect going forward. George?"

Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a",594,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a quick update of our performance in the United States. 
If you recall, at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a year of significant transformation. And so far, that's what we have done. We've been able to maintain solid momentum in the marketplace, in a number of categories that we place Big Bets on, with new products and all advertising support. This includes Heinz sauces, which grew at mid-single digits, driven by the introduction of barbecue sauce, year 2 of mustard and the share growth of ketchup; Philadelphia Cream Cheese, ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts and Lunchables, which are all growing at mid- to high single digits. However, these gains were more than offset by weak consumption trends in categories like roast-and-ground coffee, frozen nutritional meals and hotdog. 
On one hand, there are no new major categories that I would add to this list. On the other hand, we do need to move faster to adjust in the marketplace and ensure that these challenging categories do not mask the successes we are achieving with our Big Bet innovations and investments in marketing. 
Our new product initiatives for 2016 are working well, particularly the renovation of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Capri Sun ready-to-drink organic beverage, the introduction of Heinz BBQ sauces and the introduction of Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese. 
The second factor I would highlight is that our Q2 shipments were consistent with measured channels consumption, in line with our expectation from our last call. As you may have seen, the recent Scanner data was affected by the timing of the 4th of July holiday versus the prior year. Adjusting for that, our consumption would have been down roughly 2% in the second quarter. So shipments were essentially in line with consumption.
I would also note that we continue to add new business or whitespace in both Foodservice and nontraditional retail channel during the second quarter. However, Foodservice was down versus prior year in Q2 due to program timing with customers, incremental commodity-related price decline as well as minor service level problems during the quarter, which brings me to our integration program execution. 
During the quarter, the bulk of our integration activity shifted to supply chain and operation activities, including an SAP integration go live, which was completed in the quarter. Thus far, our service levels remained good for most of our product groups, with some challenges in the cold cuts segment of our meat business as well as minor disruption in Foodservice in the month of May that was quickly corrected. Overall, as Bernardo mentioned, our savings are coming in faster than planned, and we are achieving these savings without sacrificing quality. 
For the balance of the year, our key objective would be twofold: first, we must continue to execute our footprint integration, while minimizing disruption; second, we will step up our in-store activity, including a strong agenda of new product introduction we have planned for the second half. 
Look for new product introductions in our desserts, cheese and frozen categories in the months ahead, which follow the rollout of our new Devour frozen meals this past month. 
As I hope you can see, it is an exciting time for Kraft Heinz in the United States. Our plate is full, and our opportunity for profitable growth is significant. Our job is to deliver in the marketplace. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."

I will start on Slide 5 and add a few notes on Q2 financials in the U.S. 
With organic growth, pricing was up 1.2 percentage points, primarily due to lower promotional activity versus the prior year and despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities.
Volume/mix fell 3.1 percentage points, reflecting ongoing gains from innovations like Lunchables and P3, and strong volumes from our Mac & Cheese renovation that were more than offset by lower shipments in key categories, but strongest in Foodservice, and as George noted, in our meats category.
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, as mentioned in our Q1 call, this was driven by integration program savings, and to a much lesser extent, favorable price relative to lower key commodity costs. 
While we've been seeing the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the past couple of quarters, we continue to expect commodities favorability to fade as we move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, where the key factors impacting Canada in the second quarter were essentially the same as what we saw in Q1.
We still saw strong currency headwinds, but the negative 5 percentage point impact from currency in Q2 was half that seen in Q1. Organically, we were able to deliver net sales growth from pricing gains exceeding their related decline in volume/mix. 
Positive pricing of 3.1% was the result of significant pricing to offset higher product costs in local currency. And this more than offset pricing headwinds related to deflation in select key commodities. 
Volume/mix went down 1.9 percentage points, primarily from a decline in cheese, due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q2 last year as well as lower coffee and ready-to-drink beverage shipments. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 27.2% versus the year-ago period, despite a negative 7.2 percentage point impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable timing of pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.
Similar to Q1, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this quarter in Canada. However, I would note that some of the upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus local input costs. 
Moving forward and with official raw milk prices now on the rise in Canada, we would not expect the commodity favorability in the first half of this year to show up in coming quarters.
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. On our last call, I said that we felt better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, specifically in terms of profitability.
On the Q2 top line, as we saw with Q1 versus Q4, organic net sales growth was again better on a sequential basis. Organic net sales were still down and down largely due to an increase in promotional activity in U.K. condiments and sauces versus the prior year period. But our volume/mix strength kept improving, reflecting gains from condiments and sauces in most countries that were offset by lower shipments versus the prior year in the U.K. 
At the same time, while constant currency EBITDA in Europe was down slightly versus prior year, margins were up, both sequentially and versus the prior year. This was driven by a mix of manufacturing savings, lower pricing and an increase in market investments. 
So while we are not all the way out of the woods, the health of our European business is indeed better than our Q1 numbers might have indicated, and we are continuing to invest in profitable growth as we move forward. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, foreign currency was again a significant headwind, roughly 24%, mainly due to recognizing the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015. 
In terms of organic growth, we saw high single-digit organic net sales growth, driven by a good balance of volume/mix and pricing. Pricing of 5% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume/mix was up 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions.
Debt-to-EBITDA. We saw 8.8% decline in adjusted EBITDA to a negative 34.5 percentage point impact from currency, 27.5% percentage points of which was from the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q2, driven by strong organic growth. 
That covers our Q2 results. And before we go to the Q&A, I want to quickly update our expectations for our financial performance over the near to medium term. 
From an organic sales perspective, I think it's important to echo Bernardo's and George's thoughts, that is we would expect from both an industry perspective and a Kraft Heinz perspective that consumer trends in an increasingly competitive retail environment are likely to remain headwinds in both North America and Europe. 
We remain confident in our pipeline of Big Bets, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both Foodservice and international channels. However, as you have all seen, our starting point in most mature markets is declining consumption. And therefore, we have much work to do to simply get back to positive organic sales growth. 
As far as our integration program, all of our targets remain the same, savings and cost to achieve. And we are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation in 2017. 
Below the line, the redemption of our preferred stock and related financing with new debt is expected to benefit EPS growth in the second half. As a result of the new debt issuance, at today's currency rates, we expect our run rate net interest expense to be approximately 3.8% of the roughly $33 billion of gross debt outstanding at the end of Q2. 
So that's our update through the second quarter of 2016. We still have significant work ahead to realize our potential and set the stage for profitable growth in the future. We have a strong Big Bet pipeline, with a strong agenda for the second half and further whitespace opportunities to go after. At the same time, our footprint integration activity is expected to reach its peak in the second half of the year as well. And as we've said before, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. Making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis for the remainder of the year.
So while we have had a solid start to the year, we must continue to execute well against the many opportunities we have to deliver profitable growth. 
Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

And then, just related to that a little bit, how do you think about when you use a new brand versus an existing one, like [indiscernible] for example, what caused you to think that it made sense to launch a new brand and the spending related to that as opposed to using one of the ones that you might have had already.?"

A number of promotion -- a number of new product started in the past 18 months, usually, the cycle that it takes to do new product. And we have a stage and gate approach that we can sometimes accelerate and sometimes get a project to drop off. That's the process that we have used. The Big Bets that we launched this year, they were in the former companies independently worked on, and we launched them in Q1 and Q2. They weren't affected by any disruption from the integration. The 3 big ones for us this year have been the Heinz BBQ sauces, which was launched early this year and it's doing very well; the Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese, also another premium one, selling at a significant premium to the Kraft Mac & Cheese -- and it is our best-selling one out of the new product development; and Capri Sun Organic. To put something like this, it takes at least 12 months. So they all started pre -- and worked on during the merger. We also launched a new brand called Devour, just launched it in the marketplace in frozen meals segment. And that was done about 2 months ago. And that was a project that we started in late last year. So that happened after the merger. And we got to launch the brand, and we are very excited about providing big marketing support to launching that new brand. So the reality is some of them started before. Some of them started after. None of them were affected or disrupted by integrating the 2 businesses together."

I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release that, I think, our third quarter results are very representative of where we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quart",1076,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release that, I think, our third quarter results are very representative of where we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quarter, which, one hand, benefit Canada sales and EBITDA and, in other hand, made [indiscernible] financial results look worse than our internal assessment would indicate. 
Overall, our Q3 results show that we have delivery, respectful financials, but we still have significant room for improvement. We are doing a good job in a difficult environment, working effectively to navigate a combination of headwinds from deflationary commodities to increased retail competition in some of our biggest markets. We are pulling more in-store activity into the marketplace than in the first half, but we're remaining disciplined with our go-to-market activities, balancing price, promotion and distribution while we innovate to drive profitable growth. As a result, we are holding or improving market share in the majority of our categories and our key markets. Much of these is due to our Big Bet strategy and our ability to bend trends and capture whitespace. With the launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in many markets to Heinz BBQ Sauces in the United States, spicy ketchup into new markets and soy sauce expansion in China, our global sauces franchise continues to drive category growth and our share in markets around the world. 
At the more local level, the introduction of Heinz beans [ph] creation lead to more than 2 points of share gain in Australia during Q3. We are now investing behind the launch of Planters in China and Kraft Mac & Cheese in Brazil. And you are seeing some significant trend-bending from our Big Bet in the U.S., thanks to George and his team. That being said, we still have opportunity to turn around several problematic categories, which George and Paulo will highlight in a minute. 
In Europe, in particular, I would add that while our shares are in decent shape overall and whitespace initiatives on the continent are doing well, we have been slow to get the right offering into what is our more competitive and evolving retail environment in the U.K. We are getting more aggressive to jump-start our categories in the country and do expect their results next year.
On the cost front, we remain on track with our savings initiatives. Our integration program delivered roughly $330 million of savings in Q3 or roughly $1.3 billion on a run-rate basis and close to our goal, but we will not stop looking for additional savings. Not only is it important to cure [ph] investment to drive top line growth, it has been the main driver of the 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA in both Q3 and year-to-date. 
Our focus now is to set the table for 2017, delivering high-quality operation results [indiscernible] market execution in the fourth quarter as we look to build strong momentum going into next year.
In terms of [indiscernible], it's an important time for us internally. We are fully emerged in our second annual planning process as a merger [ph] company. We continue to grow and learn from each other. And our people are in the process of aligning behind our clear vision by setting challenging goals for 2017. Soon, more than 6,000 Kraft Heinz employees will finalize their objectives for the year ahead, which are cascaded down directly from my objectives in collaboration with our Board of Directors.
This also incorporates specifically [indiscernible] commitment, including significant cost targets, finalizing our Big Bet initiatives for the year ahead and determining the exact whitespace areas to push into. As a company of owners, we take our commitment in our results personally, and we make it a point to reward those who deliver on their goals. In just the third quarter alone, we promoted more than 550 Kraft Heinz employees. This is what it means to work in a performance-driven culture. It's an exciting time. We feel good about our opportunity to drive profitable growth, and we look forward to updating our expectation for 2017 in the months ahead. 
But now let's turn to Slide 3 to review the Q3 financial results that we are building upon. On the top line, we finally seem to be getting some relief from the foreign exchange headwinds we have been experienced [ph] for the past several quarters. In Q3, currency was essentially neutral, only a 0.5 negative versus the roughly 4% point drag we saw in the first half of the year. 
On an organic basis, net sales were down 1 point as pricing turned unfavorable, having been positive in the first half. Versus the prior year, pricing was down 0.7 percentage points, largely reflecting: one, deflation in meat and coffee in the United States and coffee in Canada; two, higher promotion, mainly driven by timing of expenses in Europe as well as step-it-up support behind new product launches in markets around the world. 
Volume/mix was down 0.3 percentage points, an improvement versus the 70 basis point decline we saw in the first half of the year. Versus the prior year, volume/mix reflected the lower shipments, particularly in cold cuts and foodservice in the United States. This more than offset significantly gains from innovation in Lunchables and our mac and cheese portfolio in U.S. and continued growth of condiments and sauces globally.
Net EBITDA. We drove strong dollar growth and margin performance year-over-year from a combination of our solid cost savings performance and, to a lesser extent than we saw in the first half, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs in North America. As a sidenote here, while our Q3 EBITDA margins were down sequentially from Q2 in the first half of the year, this was due to the normal seasonality of our business mix, particularly in North America. In fact, we are quite comfortable with our margin progression and how the year is playing out at the EBITDA line. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up almost 90% versus the prior period to $0.83. This reflects 3 factors: one, our solid EBITDA growth; two, the benefits from refinancing the preferred stock; and three, lower taxes driven by some discrete items coming into play in the current period.
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reporting segment and what we're expecting going forward. George?"

Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transformation of our business. First and foremost, our new product initiatives are working well and having a measurable impact. Our mac and cheese innovation is bringing people back into the category, boosting consumption and household penetration. Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meals are addressing previously unserved segments of the market. Capri Sun Organic continues to build distribution and is doing well. Our Heinz sauces business had a very successful summer season, led by our new Heinz BBQ Sauces and the second year of Heinz Mustard. And in cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese continues to grow strongly, and we're seeing good improvement in the natural cheese segment.
We also expect the impact of our new product activities to build into Q4, with advertising about to go live behind the launch of VELVEETA Mini Blocks and our all-natural Jell-O Simply Good dry packaged desert. 
The second factor I would highlight is our Q3 shipments versus consumption bridge where we continue to see improvement. As you can see in the chart, our categories were essentially flat, and our main challenge continued to be net market share losses. Behind the numbers, I can tell you that more than 80% of our impact from share losses are due to cold cuts, roast and ground coffee and snack nuts, a significantly shorter list that we've seen in the past. And in each of these areas, we either have initiatives already in the marketplace or soon to be launched to reverse those trends. So overall, we are feeling good about our momentum in measured channels. 
With regard to non-measured channels and changes in the retail inventory, there are 3 things at work: First, we continue to see strong growth in non-measured retail channels like club and value stores. Second, we continue to add new foodservice customers as we go after whitespace opportunities. However, total foodservice in Q3 was down slightly due to the traffic decline that you've heard about from the restaurant company as well as some proactive trimming of less profitable contracts in our ingredients business. And third, we had new product pipeline shipments of the VELVEETA and Jell-O innovations that I mentioned as well as a few others that benefited Q3 shipment. 
The final piece of my update is our integration program where we are well under way and, more importantly, on plan. During Q3, we maintained 98% case to [ph] rate despite some service issues that continued to negatively impact cold cuts and Lunchables and held back our sales in those 2 parts of the business. That being said, we are improving those service issues in Q4. More importantly, the overall integration project will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond from simplifying our network and colocating similar types of production line to modernizing our production processes and improving product quality.
In summary, we have a full plate of opportunities to drive profitable growth in our U.S. business, and I look forward to updating you in coming quarters. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."
278212,404700828,1072931,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 poi",1536,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. 
In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 points of key commodity deflation, mainly in meats and coffee. 
Volume/mix was down 0.5 percentage points, an improvement from the 1.5% decline we saw in the first half of the year.
We delivered strong gains from innovation, led by Lunchables and our mac and cheese innovation as well as improved volume and mix benefits in our coffee business. But these were offset by lower shipments in cold cuts, foodservice and nuts. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margins, while margins were down sequentially due to normal seasonality of the U.S. business, significant year-over-year growth and margin expansion was similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. This was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs. While we've seen the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the first 9 months of the year, we expect commodities' favorability to fade even more in the fourth quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 and the significant gains we saw in Canada's Q3 numbers. Currency turned neutral on the top line and was a small benefit to EBITDA in the quarter, much better than the significant drag it was in the first half of the year.
Organically, volume/mix swung to 3.4 percentage points of growth, up from negative 2 percentage points in the first half and driving Q3 organic net sales growth of 2%. By contrast, pricing was down 1.4 percentage points, having been up 3.4 percentage points in the first half of the year, due to commodity-driven pricing actions in coffee. 
Now before we get to EBITDA, I have to note that the Q3 volume/mix gains were driven by a combination of early events-related shipments versus the prior year and foodservice gains. And while the gains in foodservice have a good chance of repeating, we are likely to give back a good portion of the positive Q3 volume/mix in Q4. 
At the front line, adjusted EBITDA was up 32.7% versus the year-ago period in constant currency terms. This was driven by a combination of gains from cost-savings initiatives and the favorable volume/mix I just described. I would also note that consistent with what we said on our last call, there was no material impact at EBITDA from key commodities in Q3, and I will add that we may see it turn into an unfavorable impact in Q4. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. Overall, it's fair to say that we've been up and down in Europe over the past few quarters. Results this quarter were sequentially worse than Q2 after Q2 was sequentially better than Q1. However, we do not believe that the underlying trends are as bad as the Q3 numbers suggest. 
Let me deconstruct the results to give a clear picture of underlying trends. Pricing was down 2.9 percentage points, primarily due to the timing of promotional expenses versus the prior year. Volume/mix decreased 4.9 percentage points, reflecting a combination of shipment timing versus the prior year and ongoing consumption weakness in several categories, primarily in U.K. and Netherlands. So from both a pricing and volume/mix perspective, roughly half of the decline in each was due to timing that we would not expect to repeat going forward.
As a result of the factors I just described, we saw constant-currency EBITDA and margins down slightly, both on a sequential basis and versus the prior year. This reflected the combination of unfavorable volume/mix and pricing I just described and increased marketing investments that offset ongoing manufacturing savings. And again, roughly half of the constant-currency decline was due to timing that we do not expect to repeat.
So overall, we think that the health of our European business is better than our Q3 numbers indicate. And with some changes in the works, we expect the business to be a meaningful contributor in 2017. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, for the first quarter in many, foreign currency was not a significant headwind. In fact, it was slightly positive as we lapped recognition of Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
In terms of organic growth, we saw some deceleration versus the second quarter. Much of it came from pricing, which increased 1.9 percentage points. While this was driven by pricing to offset higher input costs in local currency, particularly in Latin America, it also included higher promotional spending to support new product initiatives like launching Planters in China and relaunching our soy sauces line in Indonesia. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced less local input costs inflation to offset with pricing as well as a step-up in support behind new product activity. And we would expect each of these factors to come into play in the near term.
Volume/mix was up 1.7 percentage points versus last year, again, a deceleration from the first half, primarily reflecting 3 factors: one, continuing strong growth in condiments and sauces in our regions; two, a decline in our ABC soy sauce business in Indonesia; and three, a temporary disruption in distribution within our Middle East and Africa business due to retailer consolidation in the region.
Overall, while we did see some deceleration in sales this quarter, going forward, we expect the distribution issues to be resolved and have investments in place to accelerate growth. So we don't see any reason to change our expectations for a strong growth in our Rest of the World business, either in the near term or longer term.
At adjusted EBITDA, it was down 3.9% in constant-currency terms as organic sales growth was not enough to offset higher input costs in local currency and our investments in new product initiatives. In a sense, we invested in Q3 ahead of growth. Going forward, while we face a strong comparison in Q4, we do expect better performance at the EBITDA line in our Rest of the World business in 2017.
Now before we go to Q&A, on Slide 9, I want to cover a few more factors that may impact our financial performance over the near to medium term. To start, and more as a reminder than a comment on our operating performance, from a comparisons perspective, I think it's important to note one specific factor that will affect our Q4 results. That is we will experience comparisons to Q4 2015 that included a 53rd week of shipments. Recall that when we reported Q4 2015 results, we mentioned that the 53rd week benefited net sales by 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA by 4.5 percentage points.
The second factor I want to highlight is our expectations around our integration program. Right now, we are keeping all of our targets the same, savings and costs to achieve. We are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, by 2017. As we've said before, savings have come in faster than we expected, and we do expect that input cost inflation outside of key commodity costs in North America is likely to be a partial offset to savings going forward, especially as 2017 progresses. That said, as Bernardo mentioned, we are currently firming up our 2017 plans, both costs and savings expectations, so we'll be in a better position to provide a more robust update in the coming months.
Along those lines, we are also finalizing our plans and investments behind our 2017 pipeline of Big Bet and whitespace initiatives to drive profitable growth. Based on what we've already seen in the marketplace, we remain confident in our ability to drive improvement in our top line trends in existing markets and invest behind whitespace expansion opportunities for Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. And we look forward to talking about these initiatives in the months ahead. 
The last item I want to highlight is our progress and our expectations with regard to debt leverage. To the end of Q3, we have reduced our leverage to the 3.7 to 3.8 range, and this is down from roughly 4.5 only a year ago. So we are making great progress on our goal to achieve below 3x ratio over the medium term, and we expect this to continue at a strong pace as we move forward. This includes fulfilling our commitment to pay off $2 billion of debt when it matures next year. 
That completes our update to the third quarter of 2016. There were certainly a number of puts and takes in our Q3 results. But overall, the progress we've continued to make improving our operations and performance in the marketplace gives us confidence that the profitable growth we've delivered to date is sustainable and that we can build on this going forward. Our focus from here is to finalize a strong agenda for 2017 and finish 2016 in a way that gives us good momentum heading into the next year. 
Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

What I think is important when [indiscernible] to Europe and especially the U.K. that you mentioned is to separate because we continue to have a solid performance in Continental Europe, okay? With the exception of the Netherlands, I would say all other countries having a positive year and end with a good buildup of plans for '17. But our performance in U.K. has been poor, right? The environment has been difficult, but that has been the case for a couple of years. And we really don't see that changing in the next coming months, quarters or even years. I really believe you have been slow to react and get the right price/mix and offering in the marketplace. If you see our market shares, especially on key categories like beans, sauces and others and also, to some smaller degree, fruit, it hasn't changed that much, has been quite solid share performance. But we have been suffering from a category decline and a channel mix change in the country. There is a lot happening now, especially with the new soup season right now as the winter approach the country. So we are really changing a lot our balanced price promotion, distribution in this very shaky retailer environment in the U.K. We had a changing leadership in the country as well. We moved our most -- one of the most commercials people we have from Australia and New Zealand. That's an even more difficult concentrate retailing environment to the U.K. and Europe to lead our business there. So I'm really confident that we can have a better performance looking at '17 and beyond. We've seen all the seeds of the performance, and that's already happening as we speak. That being said, the mistakes we did on price/mix and distribution, a good warning for us to have a much more solid plan coming '17."

And let me -- what we did over the past few months, we refrained the frozen meat category to broaden the customer base that we are serving. Historically, we only serviced a very small segment within the broader frozen meal, and that is what we call the nutritional, but really, it was the diet segment, the people who are on a diet. And we use the Smart Ones brand to service that consumer segment. We had to look at the category about 7, 8 months ago, and we felt we are in a strong position to broaden the segments we are serving. And essentially, we are servicing now 3 consumer segments. One is the Smart Ones segment and the diet segment for people who are managing weight losses. The second one is the Smart Maid. It's a slightly difference to that one by utilizing more product that are natural or venturing into the real food category while maintaining good calorie content. And the third one is purely on taste, and that is Devour. And we launched in the marketplace only a few months ago. And where it has distribution, we've seen our market share at mid- to high single-digit, and it's doing very well. And it's servicing a segment that is -- where weight management and calories is less relevant and taste is the key criteria. So -- and we're very happy where we are so far. That segment, for us, the frozen meal went on a severe decline. And every time we venture in serving your customers, we cut that decline significantly, and we feel very good about its prospects moving forward."

We felt the focus on building the capabilities has far long-term impact on what we do than having a project to get a quick wins out of it. And the second, once we built that capability, we started testing in a number of business units, and we tested 1 or 2 categories in each business unit. We liked what we saw. And it is not just a promotional activity. It is a number of levers that we looked at. And in some cases, we saw ourselves investing more rather than investing less. In some places, we took prices up. In others, we infused and took prices down. But we are very happy with the capabilities we're building. The reason I said this is a long-term and we want to do it the right rather than doing it fast because it has wider impact on your product mix.

I understand the way you are grouping different things and so on. But I think it's important here to separate. First, on the Rest of the World part, we continue to see, really, very solid near- and long-term growth perspective for the business. As Paul said, there were temporary behind -- temporary issues behind this quarter like distributors disruption in Middle East and Africa. We invested more behind the growth already seen for '17. For example, the launch of Planters in China, is a good example and others. So we are seeing -- we were seeing this in a very, I would say, a solid way. On respect of the model, and again, I totally understand your comments. I think there are learnings from the U.K. situation that are really specific to the country. Especially, remember, what happened to the U.K. in the last 2 [ph] years is that the leader of the retail environment really faced a lot of problems and disconnect to the market from quite some time for different issues. And now he's coming back in a very strong way. And this retail shaking that happened in the country, I truly believe you have not been fast enough on the offerings that are coming. I cannot see any correlation to your question to the model, given that everything we did, we did -- if you see all our lines connected to the market like marketing, selling and other investments, they all grew up in the country in the last 4 years. So from a model standpoint, there is absolutely no correlation. There is a [indiscernible] assets for us. That's your last question. Can you learn from the U.K. and to be applied in other places like the U.S. and others? There I could not agree more. I think they are important lessons from us, for me, for George, for Paulo and for the entire team here, that we're to need to prepare especially when you have a situation by happened in the retail or the U.K., it's not that they're often that, that happens for us to be ahead of the game and not to react to it, given the market share and the positions we have in the country. So I think, the situation that we're in, your bundle are very different. In Rest of the World, I mean, I'm investing for more growth. So I'm coming for China with a different plan and coming for Indonesia and coming here from a true markets we'd like whitespace like Australia and New Zealand. In the U.K., it's a different story. My volume/mix and everything I'm working behind my promo activity is to be right for the do offering my distribution. So I can come back to profitable growth strategy. From a model standpoint, and the question that you got too much or you cut to little, I can't have any correlation given that because in a sense, my marketing is going up and my selling is going up within the country. [indiscernible] to say, ""Hey, if I have not invested as I did this year in U.K., I probably would be better off."" But my offering didn't come true as it should. I know don't think it's the right thing to do as well because we are looking for U.K. for the next 10, 15, 20 years. So the brands we have in the country are so strong and our record is so solid that we are never going to sacrifice the mid or long term for any short-term gains. We don't do that. So in a sense, I don't think it's a model issue. I think it is, for sure, a question of the balance of product mix and offering. And so in those learnings, we should think and apply in other markets."

We had some normal timing impacts this quarter, which, one hand, benefit Canada's sales and EBITDA and, in other hand, made Europe's financial results look worse than our internal assessment would indicate. 
Overall, our Q3 results show that we have delivery, respectful financials, but we still have significant room for improvement. We are doing a good job in a difficult environment, working effectively to navigate a combination of headwinds from deflationary commodities to increased retail competition in some of our biggest markets. We are pulling more in-store activity into the marketplace than in the first half, but we're remaining disciplined with our go-to-market activities, balancing price, promotion and distribution while we innovate to drive profitable growth. As a result, we are holding or improving market share in the majority of our categories and our key markets. Much of these is due to our Big Bet strategy and our ability to bend trends and capture whitespace. With the launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in many markets to Heinz BBQ Sauces in the United States, spicy ketchup into new markets and soy sauce expansion in China, our global sauces franchise continues to drive category growth and our share in markets around the world. 
At the more local level, the introduction of Heinz Beanz Creationz lead to more than 2 points of share gain in Australia during Q3. We are now investing behind the launch of Planters in China and Kraft Mac & Cheese in Brazil. And you are seeing some significant trend-bending from our Big Bet in the U.S., thanks to George and his team. That being said, we still have opportunity to turn around several problematic categories, which George and Paulo will highlight in a minute. 
In Europe, in particular, I would add that while our shares are in decent shape overall and whitespace initiatives on the continent are doing well, we have been slow to get the right offering into what is our more competitive and evolving retail environment in the U.K. We are getting more aggressive to jump-start our categories in the country and do expect their results next year.
On the cost front, we remain on track with our savings initiatives. Our integration program delivered roughly $330 million of savings in Q3 or roughly $1.3 billion on a run-rate basis and close to our goal, but we will not stop looking for additional savings. Not only is it important to pour [ph] investment to drive top line growth, it has been the main driver of the 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA in both Q3 and year-to-date. 
Our focus now is to set the table for 2017, delivering high-quality operation results and end-market execution in the fourth quarter as we look to build strong momentum going into next year.
In terms of rate of returns, this is an important time for us internally. We are fully merged in our second annual planning process as a merged company. We continue to grow and learn from each other. And our people are in the process of aligning behind our clear vision by setting challenging goals for 2017. Soon, more than 6,000 Kraft Heinz employees will finalize their objectives for the year ahead, which are cascaded down directly from my objectives in collaboration with our Board of Directors.
This also incorporates specifically KPIs [ph] commitment, including significant cost targets, finalizing our Big Bet initiatives for the year ahead and determining the exact whitespace areas to push into. As a company of owners, we take our commitment in our results personally, and we make it a point to reward those who deliver on their goals. In just the third quarter alone, we promoted more than 550 Kraft Heinz employees. This is what it means to work in a performance-driven culture. It's an exciting time. We feel good about our opportunity to drive profitable growth, and we look forward to updating our expectation for 2017 in the months ahead. 
But now let's turn to Slide 3 to review the Q3 financial results that we are building upon. On the top line, we finally seem to be getting some relief from the foreign exchange headwinds we have been experienced for the past several quarters. In Q3, currency was essentially neutral, only a 0.5 negative versus the roughly 4% point drag we saw in the first half of the year. 
On an organic basis, net sales were down 1 point as pricing turned unfavorable, having been positive in the first half. Versus the prior year, pricing was down 0.7 percentage points, largely reflecting: one, deflation in meat and coffee in the United States and coffee in Canada; two, higher promotion, mainly driven by timing of expenses in Europe as well as step-it-up support behind new product launches in markets around the world. 
Volume/mix was down 0.3 percentage points, an improvement versus the 70 basis point decline we saw in the first half of the year. Versus the prior year, volume/mix reflected the lower shipments, particularly in cold cuts and foodservice in the United States. This more than offset significantly gains from innovation in Lunchables and our mac and cheese portfolio in U.S. and continued growth of condiments and sauces globally.
Net EBITDA. We drove strong dollar growth and margin performance year-over-year from a combination of our solid cost savings performance and, to a lesser extent than we saw in the first half, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs in North America. As a sidenote here, while our Q3 EBITDA margins were down sequentially from Q2 in the first half of the year, this was due to the normal seasonality of our business mix, particularly in North America. In fact, we are quite comfortable with our margin progression and how the year is playing out at the EBITDA line. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up almost 90% versus the prior period to $0.83. This reflects 3 factors: one, our solid EBITDA growth; two, the benefits from refinancing the preferred stock; and three, lower taxes driven by some discrete items coming into play in the current period.
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reporting segment and what we're expecting going forward. George?"
278212,404700828,1073194,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transf",549,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transformation of our business. First and foremost, our new product initiatives are working well and having a measurable impact. Our mac and cheese innovation is bringing people back into the category, boosting consumption and household penetration. Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meals are addressing previously unserved segments of the market. Capri Sun Organic continues to build distribution and is doing well. Our Heinz sauces business had a very successful summer season, led by our new Heinz BBQ Sauces and the second year of Heinz Mustard. And in cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese continues to grow strongly, and we're seeing good improvement in the natural cheese segment.
We also expect the impact of our new product activities to build into Q4, with advertising about to go live behind the launch of VELVEETA Mini Blocks and our all-natural Jell-O Simply Good dry packaged desert. 
The second factor I would highlight is our Q3 shipments versus consumption bridge where we continue to see improvement. As you can see in the chart, our categories were essentially flat, and our main challenge continued to be net market share losses. Behind the numbers, I can tell you that more than 80% of our impact from share losses are due to cold cuts, roast and ground coffee and snack nuts, a significantly shorter list that we've seen in the past. And in each of these areas, we either have initiatives already in the marketplace or soon to be launched to reverse those trends. So overall, we are feeling good about our momentum in measured channels. 
With regard to non-measured channels and changes in the retail inventory, there are 3 things at work: First, we continue to see strong growth in non-measured retail channels like club and value stores. Second, we continue to add new foodservice customers as we go after whitespace opportunities. However, total foodservice in Q3 was down slightly due to the traffic decline that you've heard about from the restaurant company as well as some proactive trimming of less profitable contracts in our ingredients business. And third, we had new product pipeline shipments of the VELVEETA and Jell-O innovations that I mentioned as well as a few others that benefited Q3 shipment. 
The final piece of my update is our integration program where we are well under way and, more importantly, on plan. During Q3, we maintained 98% case fill rate despite some service issues that continued to negatively impact cold cuts and Lunchables and held back our sales in those 2 parts of the business. That being said, we are improving those service issues in Q4. More importantly, the overall integration project will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond from simplifying our network and colocating similar types of production line to modernizing our production processes and improving product quality.
In summary, we have a full plate of opportunities to drive profitable growth in our U.S. business, and I look forward to updating you in coming quarters. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."
278212,404700828,1073194,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 poi",1536,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. 
In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 points of key commodity deflation, mainly in meats and coffee. 
Volume/mix was down 0.5 percentage points, an improvement from the 1.5% decline we saw in the first half of the year.
We delivered strong gains from innovation, led by Lunchables and our mac and cheese innovation as well as improved volume and mix benefits in our coffee business. But these were offset by lower shipments in cold cuts, foodservice and nuts. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margins, while margins were down sequentially due to normal seasonality of the U.S. business, significant year-over-year growth and margin expansion was similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. This was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs. While we've seen the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the first 9 months of the year, we expect commodities' favorability to fade even more in the fourth quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 and the significant gains we saw in Canada's Q3 numbers. Currency turned neutral on the top line and was a small benefit to EBITDA in the quarter, much better than the significant drag it was in the first half of the year.
Organically, volume/mix swung to 3.4 percentage points of growth, up from negative 2 percentage points in the first half and driving Q3 organic net sales growth of 2%. By contrast, pricing was down 1.4 percentage points, having been up 3.4 percentage points in the first half of the year, due to commodity-driven pricing actions in coffee. 
Now before we get to EBITDA, I have to note that the Q3 volume/mix gains were driven by a combination of early events-related shipments versus the prior year and foodservice gains. And while the gains in foodservice have a good chance of repeating, we are likely to give back a good portion of the positive Q3 volume/mix in Q4. 
At the front line, adjusted EBITDA was up 32.7% versus the year-ago period in constant currency terms. This was driven by a combination of gains from cost-savings initiatives and the favorable volume/mix I just described. I would also note that consistent with what we said on our last call, there was no material impact at EBITDA from key commodities in Q3, and I will add that we may see it turn into an unfavorable impact in Q4. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. Overall, it's fair to say that we've been up and down in Europe over the past few quarters. Results this quarter were sequentially worse than Q2 after Q2 was sequentially better than Q1. However, we do not believe that the underlying trends are as bad as the Q3 numbers suggest. 
Let me deconstruct the results to give a clear picture of underlying trends. Pricing was down 2.9 percentage points, primarily due to the timing of promotional expenses versus the prior year. Volume/mix decreased 4.9 percentage points, reflecting a combination of shipment timing versus the prior year and ongoing consumption weakness in several categories, primarily in U.K. and Netherlands. So from both a pricing and volume/mix perspective, roughly half of the decline in each was due to timing that we would not expect to repeat going forward.
As a result of the factors I just described, we saw constant-currency EBITDA and margins down slightly, both on a sequential basis and versus the prior year. This reflected the combination of unfavorable volume/mix and pricing I just described and increased marketing investments that offset ongoing manufacturing savings. And again, roughly half of the constant-currency decline was due to timing that we do not expect to repeat.
So overall, we think that the health of our European business is better than our Q3 numbers indicate. And with some changes in the works, we expect the business to be a meaningful contributor in 2017. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, for the first quarter in many, foreign currency was not a significant headwind. In fact, it was slightly positive as we lapped recognition of Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
In terms of organic growth, we saw some deceleration versus the second quarter. Much of it came from pricing, which increased 1.9 percentage points. While this was driven by pricing to offset higher input costs in local currency, particularly in Latin America, it also included higher promotional spending to support new product initiatives like launching Planters in China and relaunching our soy sauces line in Indonesia. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced less local input costs inflation to offset with pricing as well as a step-up in support behind new product activity. And we would expect each of these factors to come into play in the near term.
Volume/mix was up 1.7 percentage points versus last year, again, a deceleration from the first half, primarily reflecting 3 factors: one, continuing strong growth in condiments and sauces in our regions; two, a decline in our ABC soy sauce business in Indonesia; and three, a temporary disruption in distribution within our Middle East and Africa business due to retailer consolidation in the region.
Overall, while we did see some deceleration in sales this quarter, going forward, we expect the distribution issues to be resolved and have investments in place to accelerate growth. So we don't see any reason to change our expectations for a strong growth in our Rest of the World business, either in the near term or longer term.
At adjusted EBITDA, it was down 3.9% in constant-currency terms as organic sales growth was not enough to offset higher input costs in local currency and our investments in new product initiatives. In a sense, we invested in Q3 ahead of growth. Going forward, while we face a strong comparison in Q4, we do expect better performance at the EBITDA line in our Rest of the World business in 2017.
Now before we go to Q&A, on Slide 9, I want to cover a few more factors that may impact our financial performance over the near to medium term. To start, and more as a reminder than a comment on our operating performance, from a comparisons perspective, I think it's important to note one specific factor that will affect our Q4 results. That is we will experience comparisons to Q4 2015 that included a 53rd week of shipments. Recall that when we reported Q4 2015 results, we mentioned that the 53rd week benefited net sales by 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA by 4.5 percentage points.
The second factor I want to highlight is our expectations around our integration program. Right now, we are keeping all of our targets the same, savings and costs to achieve. We are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, by 2017. As we've said before, savings have come in faster than we expected, and we do expect that input cost inflation outside of key commodity costs in North America is likely to be a partial offset to savings going forward, especially as 2017 progresses. That said, as Bernardo mentioned, we are currently firming up our 2017 plans, both costs and savings expectations, so we'll be in a better position to provide a more robust update in the coming months.
Along those lines, we are also finalizing our plans and investments behind our 2017 pipeline of Big Bet and whitespace initiatives to drive profitable growth. Based on what we've already seen in the marketplace, we remain confident in our ability to drive improvement in our top line trends in existing markets and invest behind whitespace expansion opportunities for Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. And we look forward to talking about these initiatives in the months ahead. 
The last item I want to highlight is our progress and our expectations with regard to debt leverage. To the end of Q3, we have reduced our leverage to the 3.7 to 3.8 range, and this is down from roughly 4.5 only a year ago. So we are making great progress on our goal to achieve below 3x ratio over the medium term, and we expect this to continue at a strong pace as we move forward. This includes fulfilling our commitment to pay off $2 billion of debt when it matures next year. 
That completes our update to the third quarter of 2016. There were certainly a number of puts and takes in our Q3 results. But overall, the progress we've continued to make improving our operations and performance in the marketplace gives us confidence that the profitable growth we've delivered to date is sustainable and that we can build on this going forward. Our focus from here is to finalize a strong agenda for 2017 and finish 2016 in a way that gives us good momentum heading into the next year. 
Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions."

I really don't think the U.K. performance, and I want to comment about that in a minute, has anything to do with the [indiscernible] spend or that we cut too much or the model that's -- I can guarantee you, I really don't see that way. What I think is important when it's to Europe and especially the U.K. that you mentioned is to separate because we continue to have a solid performance in Continental Europe, okay? With the exception of the Netherlands, I would say all other countries having a positive year and end with a good buildup of plans for '17. But our performance in U.K. has been poor, right? The environment has been difficult, but that has been the case for a couple of years. And we really don't see that changing in the next coming months, quarters or even years. I really believe you have been slow to react and get the right price/mix and offering in the marketplace. If you see our market shares, especially on key categories like beans, sauces and others and also, to some smaller degree, fruit, it hasn't changed that much, has been quite solid share performance. But we have been suffering from a category decline and a channel mix change in the country. There is a lot happening now, especially with the new soup season that size [ph] right now as the winter approach the country. So we're really changing a lot our balanced price, promotion, distribution in this very shaky retailer environment in the U.K. We had a change in leadership in the country as well. We moved our most -- one of the most talented [ph] commercials people we had from Australia and New Zealand. That's an even more difficult to concentrate retail environment to the U.K. and Europe to lead our business there. So I'm really confident that we can have a better performance looking at '17 and beyond. We've seen all the seeds of the performance, and that's already happening as we speak. That being said, the mistakes we did on price/mix and distribution are good warning for us to have a much more solid plan coming '17."

So the big 4 commodities that have impact on our business are mainly in dairy, in meat, in coffee and in nuts. And we have seen different directions, depending on the category. So as of late, we have seen coffee has edged up a little bit, so has dairy, where meat went into the other direction. For us, it's very hard to try to call where it's going to be in the future. We are better off at managing the actual outcome of  it than actually trying to forecast it. Especially the movement, whether up or down, that we are seeing has no fundamentals.

So let me break it down and give you commentary around each one of them. The service issues that we have are restricted to 2 categories, happen to be large categories for us. One is what we call the cold cuts, which is the sliced meats; and the other one is Lunchables. Lunchables is driven by a very, very strong demand. We saw, mid-year, some double-digit growth in that business. And while it's still growing, our ability to supply have been somehow constrained, and we are working now and getting out of it. But the business is still growing. In cold cuts and the sliced meat, we have had capacity issues, and this is the area where we are investing the most in our footprint changes.  We're essentially building brand-new factories -- 2 brand-new factories, one in Davenport, one in Kirksville, as an addition to the factories we have there. And we started working on getting out of the service levels, but that was severely affected with service levels. And we have some distribution losses in some of the customers, and that was jointly managed and agreed between us and our trade partners. And within time, as our ability to supply increases, you will see us moving forward in that. As for the hotdog category, that is a category issue. So our market share is in line with where the category and our growth rate will decline. It's in line with the categories, and we feel very good about our bacon business where we are doing well."

And let me -- what we did over the past few months, we reframed the frozen meal category to broaden the customer base that we are serving. Historically, we only service a very small segment within the broader frozen meal, and that is what we call nutritional, but really, it was the diet segment, the people who are on a diet. And we use the Smart Ones brand to service that consumer segment. We had to look at the category about 7, 8 months ago, and we felt we are in a strong position to broaden the segments we are serving. And essentially, we are servicing now 3 consumer segments. One is the Smart Ones segment and the diet segment for people who are managing weight losses. The second one is the SMARTMADE. It's a slight difference to that one by utilizing more product that are natural or venturing into the real food category while maintaining good calorie content. And the third one is purely on taste, and that is Devour. And we launched in the marketplace only a few months ago. And where it has distribution, we've seen our market share at mid- to high single digit, and it's doing very well. And it's servicing a segment that is -- that -- where weight management and calories is less relevant and taste is the key criteria. So -- and we're very happy where we are so far. That segment, for us, the frozen meal was in a severe decline. And every time we venture in serving new customers, we cut that decline significantly, and we feel very good about its prospect moving forward."

We felt the focus on building the capabilities has far long-term impact on what we do than having a project to get a quick wins out of it. And the second, once we built that capability, we started testing in a number of business units, and we tested 1 or 2 categories in each business unit. We liked what we saw. And it is not just a promotional activity. It is a number of levers that we looked at. And in some cases, we saw ourselves investing more rather than investing less. In some places, we took prices up. In others, we infused and took prices down. But we are very happy with the capabilities we're building.

I understand the way you are grouping different things and so on, but I think it's important here to separate. First, on the Rest of the World part, we continue to see, really, very solid near- and long-term growth perspective to the business. As Paulo said, there were temporary behind -- temporary issues behind this quarter like distributors' disruption in Middle East and Africa. We invested much more behind the growth already seen for '17. For example, the launch of Planters in China is a good example and others. So we are -- we were seeing this in a very, I would say, a solid way. On respect of the model, and again, I totally understand your comments, I think there are learnings from the U.K. situation that are really specific to the country. Especially, remember what happened to the U.K. in the last 2 years is that the leader of the retail environment really faced a lot of problems and disconnect to the market for quite some time for different issues. And now he's coming back in a very strong way. And this retail shaking that happened in the country, I truly believe you have not been fast enough on the offerings that are coming. I cannot see any correlation to your question to the model. Given that everything we did, we didn't -- if you see all our lines connected to the market like marketing, selling and other investments, they all grew up in the country in the last 4 years. So from a model standpoint, there is absolutely no correlation. There is a lot of lessons for us. That's your last question. Can you learn from the U.K. and to be applied in other places like the U.S. and others? I -- then I could not agree more. I think they are important lessons from us, for me, for George, for Paulo and for the entire team here that we -- that you're going to need to prepare, especially when you have a situation like happened in the retail or U.K. It's not that they're often, that, that happens for us to be ahead of the game and not reactive, given the market share and the positions we have in the country. So I think the situation, your bundle are very different. In Rest of the World, I mean, investing for more growth. So I'm coming for China with a different plan and coming for Indonesia and coming here from a true markets with whitespace like Australia and New Zealand. In the U.K., it's a different story. My volume/mix and everything I'm working behind my promo activity is to get right what is the offering in my distribution, so I can come back to profitable growth strategy. From a model standpoint, and the question that you cut too much or cut too little, I can't have any correlation, given where it is. Because in a sense, my marketing is going up and my selling is going up within the country. The last greatest thing I would to us is to say, ""Hey, if I have not invested as I did this year in U.K., I probably would be better off."" But my offering didn't come true as it should, and I don't think it's the right thing to do as well because we are looking for U.K. for the next 10, 15, 20 years. So the brands we have in the country are so strong, and our record is so solid that we are never going to sacrifice the mid or long term for any short-term gains. We don't do that. So in a sense, I don't think it's a model issue. I think it is, for sure, a question of the balance of product mix and offering. And so -- and those learnings, we should take and apply in other markets."

Our promotional activities and the intensity of our promotional activities keep changing, depending on a number of factors: One is the competitive environment. Two is the strategic position of that category. So when we look at our categories, we classify them as an invest category, protect category or bet on or manage for margin. And so we do not just have one view of promotional activities and we go and implement it. So if you look deeper into our sales, if you go one layer down or 2 or 3, you would find a very different direction, and that's why we try not to take as an overall view, whether it's going up or down. And as for the investments moving forward, we would continue exactly utilizing that same strategy. What we're finding, though, it's not just the promotional activities or the sales generated from promotional activities rather than the return that we get from promotional activity. We have become, through data analytics, a lot more competent in the ability to select which promotion and which category with which account. And we're finding very, very different returns. And that, by itself, is allowing us to actually do more with less. So we're not going to somebody and just saying, ""We're cutting across-the-board promotional activities."" We're just doing more with less."

I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release that I think our third quarter results are very representative of where we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quarter",1078,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release that I think our third quarter results are very representative of where we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quarter, which, one hand, benefit Canada's sales and EBITDA and, in other hand, made Europe's financial results look worse than our internal assessment would indicate. 
Overall, our Q3 results show that we have delivery, respectful financials, but we still have significant room for improvement. We are doing a good job in a difficult environment, working effectively to navigate a combination of headwinds from deflationary commodities to increased retail competition in some of our biggest markets. We are pulling more in-store activity into the marketplace than in the first half, but we're remaining disciplined with our go-to-market activities, balancing price, promotion and distribution while we innovate to drive profitable growth. As a result, we are holding or improving market share in the majority of our categories and our key markets. Much of these is due to our Big Bet strategy and our ability to bend trends and capture whitespace. With the launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in many markets to Heinz BBQ Sauces in the United States, spicy ketchup into new markets and soy sauce expansion in China, our global sauces franchise continues to drive category growth and our share in markets around the world. 
At the more local level, the introduction of Heinz Beanz Creationz lead to more than 2 points of share gain in Australia during Q3. We are now investing behind the launch of Planters in China and Kraft Mac & Cheese in Brazil. And you are seeing some significant trend-bending from our Big Bet in the U.S., thanks to George and his team. That being said, we still have opportunity to turn around several problematic categories, which George and Paulo will highlight in a minute. 
In Europe, in particular, I would add that while our shares are in decent shape overall and whitespace initiatives on the continent are doing well, we have been slow to get the right offering into what is our more competitive and evolving retail environment in the U.K. We are getting more aggressive to jump-start our categories in the country and do expect better results next year.
On the cost front, we remain on track with our savings initiatives. Our integration program delivered roughly $330 million of savings in Q3 or roughly $1.3 billion on a run-rate basis and close to our goal, but we will not stop looking for additional savings. Not only is it important to pour [ph] investment to drive top line growth, it has been the main driver of the 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA in both Q3 and year-to-date. 
Our focus now is to set the table for 2017, delivering high-quality operation results and end-market execution in the fourth quarter as we look to build strong momentum going into next year.
In terms of rate of returns, this is an important time for us internally. We are fully merged in our second annual planning process as a merged company. We continue to grow and learn from each other. And our people are in the process of aligning behind our clear vision by setting challenging goals for 2017. Soon, more than 6,000 Kraft Heinz employees will finalize their objectives for the year ahead, which are cascaded down directly from my objectives in collaboration with our Board of Directors.
This also incorporates specifically KPIs [ph] commitment, including significant cost targets, finalizing our Big Bet initiatives for the year ahead and determining the exact whitespace areas to push into. As a company of owners, we take our commitment in our results personally, and we make it a point to reward those who deliver on their goals. In just the third quarter alone, we promoted more than 550 Kraft Heinz employees. This is what it means to work in a performance-driven culture. It's an exciting time. We feel good about our opportunity to drive profitable growth, and we look forward to updating our expectation for 2017 in the months ahead. 
But now let's turn to Slide 3 to review the Q3 financial results that we are building upon. On the top line, we finally seem to be getting some relief from the foreign exchange headwinds we have been experienced for the past several quarters. In Q3, currency was essentially neutral, only a 0.5 negative versus the roughly 4% point drag we saw in the first half of the year. 
On an organic basis, net sales were down 1 point as pricing turned unfavorable, having been positive in the first half. Versus the prior year, pricing was down 0.7 percentage points, largely reflecting: one, deflation in meat and coffee in the United States and coffee in Canada; two, higher promotion, mainly driven by timing of expenses in Europe as well as step-it-up support behind new product launches in markets around the world. 
Volume/mix was down 0.3 percentage points, an improvement versus the 70 basis point decline we saw in the first half of the year. Versus the prior year, volume/mix reflected the lower shipments, particularly in cold cuts and Foodservice in the United States. This more than offset significant gains from innovation in Lunchables and our Mac and Cheese portfolio in U.S. and continued growth of condiments and sauces globally.
Net EBITDA. We drove strong dollar growth and margin performance year-over-year from a combination of our solid cost savings performance and, to a lesser extent than we saw in the first half, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs in North America. As a side note here, while our Q3 EBITDA margins were down sequentially from Q2 in the first half of the year, this was due to the normal seasonality of our business mix, particularly in North America. In fact, we are quite comfortable with our margin progression and how the year is playing out at the EBITDA line. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up almost 90% versus the prior period to $0.83. This reflects 3 factors: one, our solid EBITDA growth; two, the benefits from refinancing the preferred stock; and three, lower taxes driven by some discrete items coming into play in the current period.
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reporting segment and what we're expecting going forward. George?"
278212,404700828,1073361,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transf",549,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transformation of our business. First and foremost, our new product initiatives are working well and having a measurable impact. Our Mac and Cheese innovation is bringing people back into the category, boosting consumption and household penetration. Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meals are addressing previously unserved segments of the market. Capri Sun Organic continues to build distribution and is doing well. Our Heinz sauces business had a very successful summer season, led by our new Heinz BBQ Sauces and the second year of Heinz Mustard. And in cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese continues to grow strongly, and we're seeing good improvement in the natural cheese segment.
We also expect the impact of our new product activities to build into Q4, with advertising about to go live behind the launch of VELVEETA Mini Blocks and our all-natural Jell-O Simply Good dry packaged dessert. 
The second factor I would highlight is our Q3 shipments versus consumption bridge where we continue to see improvement. As you can see in the chart, our categories were essentially flat, and our main challenge continued to be net market share losses. Behind the numbers, I can tell you that more than 80% of our impact from share losses are due to cold cuts, roast and ground coffee and snack nuts, a significantly shorter list than we've seen in the past. And in each of these areas, we either have initiatives already in the marketplace or soon to be launched to reverse those trends. So overall, we are feeling good about our momentum in measured channels. 
With regard to non-measured channels and changes in the retail inventory, there are 3 things at work: First, we continue to see strong growth in non-measured retail channels like club and value stores. Second, we continue to add new Foodservice customers as we go after whitespace opportunities. However, total Foodservice in Q3 was down slightly due to the traffic decline that you've heard about from the restaurant company as well as some proactive trimming of less profitable contracts in our ingredients business. And third, we had new product pipeline shipments of the VELVEETA and Jell-O innovations that I mentioned as well as a few others that benefited Q3 shipment. 
The final piece of my update is our integration program where we are well under way and, more importantly, on plan. During Q3, we maintained 98% case fill rate despite some service issues that continued to negatively impact cold cuts and Lunchables and held back our sales in those 2 parts of the business. That being said, we are improving those service issues in Q4. More importantly, the overall integration project will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond from simplifying our network and colocating similar types of production lines to modernizing our production processes and improving product quality.
In summary, we have a full plate of opportunities to drive profitable growth in our U.S. business, and I look forward to updating you in coming quarters. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."
278212,404700828,1073361,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 poi",1536,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. 
In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 points of key commodity deflation, mainly in meats and coffee. 
Volume/mix was down 0.5 percentage points, an improvement from the 1.5% decline we saw in the first half of the year.
We delivered strong gains from innovation, led by Lunchables and our Mac and Cheese innovation as well as improved volume and mix benefits in our coffee business. But these were offset by lower shipments in cold cuts, Foodservice and nuts. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margins, while margins were down sequentially due to normal seasonality of the U.S. business, significant year-over-year growth and margin expansion was similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. This was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs. While we've seen the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the first 9 months of the year, we expect commodities' favorability to fade even more in the fourth quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 and the significant gains we saw in Canada's Q3 numbers. Currency turned neutral on the top line and was a small benefit to EBITDA in the quarter, much better than the significant drag it was in the first half of the year.
Organically, volume/mix swung to 3.4 percentage points of growth, up from negative 2 percentage points in the first half and driving Q3 organic net sales growth of 2%. By contrast, pricing was down 1.4 percentage points, having been up 3.4 percentage points in the first half of the year, due to commodity-driven pricing actions in coffee. 
Now before we get to EBITDA, I have to note that the Q3 volume/mix gains were driven by a combination of early events-related shipments versus the prior year and Foodservice gains. And while the gains in Foodservice have a good chance of repeating, we are likely to give back a good portion of the positive Q3 volume/mix in Q4. 
At the top line, adjusted EBITDA was up 32.7% versus the year-ago period in constant currency terms. This was driven by a combination of gains from cost-savings initiatives and the favorable volume/mix I just described. I would also note that consistent with what we said on our last call, there was no material impact at EBITDA from key commodities in Q3, and I will add that we may see it turn into an unfavorable impact in Q4. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. Overall, it's fair to say that we've been up and down in Europe over the past few quarters. Results this quarter were sequentially worse than Q2 after Q2 was sequentially better than Q1. However, we do not believe that the underlying trends are as bad as the Q3 numbers suggest. 
Let me deconstruct the results to give a clear picture of underlying trends. Pricing was down 2.9 percentage points, primarily due to the timing of promotional expenses versus the prior year. Volume/mix decreased 4.9 percentage points, reflecting a combination of shipment timing versus the prior year and ongoing consumption weakness in several categories, primarily in U.K. and Netherlands. So from both a pricing and volume/mix perspective, roughly half of the decline in each was due to timing that we would not expect to repeat going forward.
As a result of the factors I just described, we saw constant-currency EBITDA and margins down slightly, both on a sequential basis and versus the prior year. This reflected the combination of unfavorable volume/mix and pricing I just described and increased marketing investments that offset ongoing manufacturing savings. And again, roughly half of the constant-currency decline was due to timing that we do not expect to repeat.
So overall, we think that the health of our European business is better than our Q3 numbers indicate. And with some changes in the works, we expect the business to be a meaningful contributor in 2017. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, for the first quarter in many, foreign currency was not a significant headwind. In fact, it was slightly positive as we lapped recognition of Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
In terms of organic growth, we saw some deceleration versus the second quarter. Much of it came from pricing, which increased 1.9 percentage points. While this was driven by pricing to offset higher input costs in local currency, particularly in Latin America, it also included higher promotional spending to support new product initiatives like launching Planters in China and relaunching our soy sauces line in Indonesia. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced less local input cost inflation to offset with pricing as well as a step-up in support behind new product activity. And we would expect each of these factors to come into play in the near term.
Volume/mix was up 1.7 percentage points versus last year, again, a deceleration from the first half, primarily reflecting 3 factors: one, continuing strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions; two, a decline in our ABC soy sauce business in Indonesia; and three, a temporary disruption in distribution within our Middle East and Africa business due to retailer consolidation in the region.
Overall, while we did see some deceleration in sales this quarter, going forward, we expect the distribution issues to be resolved and have investments in place to accelerate growth. So we don't see any reason to change our expectations for a strong growth in our Rest of the World business, either in the near term or longer term.
At adjusted EBITDA, it was down 3.9% in constant-currency terms as organic sales growth was not enough to offset higher input costs in local currency and our investments in new product initiatives. In a sense, we invested in Q3 ahead of growth. Going forward, while we face a strong comparison in Q4, we do expect better performance at the EBITDA line in our Rest of the World business in 2017.
Now before we go to Q&A, on Slide 9, I want to cover a few more factors that may impact our financial performance over the near to medium term. To start, and more as a reminder than a comment on our operating performance, from a comparisons perspective, I think it's important to note one specific factor that will affect our Q4 results. That is, we will experience comparisons to Q4 2015 that included a 53rd week of shipments. Recall that when we reported Q4 2015 results, we mentioned that the 53rd week benefited net sales by 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA by 4.5 percentage points.
The second factor I want to highlight is our expectations around our integration program. Right now, we are keeping all of our targets the same, savings and costs to achieve. We are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, by 2017. As we've said before, savings have come in faster than we expected, and we do expect that input cost inflation outside of key commodity costs in North America is likely to be a partial offset to savings going forward, especially as 2017 progresses. That said, as Bernardo mentioned, we are currently firming up our 2017 plans, both costs and savings expectations, so we'll be in a better position to provide a more robust update in the coming months.
Along those lines, we are also finalizing our plans and investments behind our 2017 pipeline of Big Bet and whitespace initiatives to drive profitable growth. Based on what we've already seen in the marketplace, we remain confident in our ability to drive improvement in our top line trends in existing markets and invest behind whitespace expansion opportunities for Kraft and Heinz brands in both Foodservice and international channels. And we look forward to talking about these initiatives in the months ahead. 
The last item I want to highlight is our progress and our expectations with regard to debt leverage. To the end of Q3, we have reduced our leverage to the 3.7 to 3.8 range, and this is down from roughly 4.5 only a year ago. So we are making great progress on our goal to achieve below 3x ratio over the medium term, and we expect this to continue at a strong pace as we move forward. This includes fulfilling our commitment to pay off $2 billion of debt when it matures next year. 
That completes our update to the third quarter of 2016. There were certainly a number of puts and takes in our Q3 results. But overall, the progress we've continued to make improving our operations and performance in the marketplace gives us confidence that the profitable growth we've delivered to date is sustainable and that we can build on this going forward. Our focus from here is to finalize a strong agenda for 2017 and finish 2016 in a way that gives us good momentum heading into the next year.

I really don't think the U.K. performance, and I want to comment about that in a minute, has anything to do with the level of spend or that we cut too much or the model that's -- I can guarantee you, I really don't see that way. What I think is important when it's to Europe and especially the U.K. that you mentioned is to separate because we continue to have a solid performance in Continental Europe, okay? With the exception of the Netherlands, I would say all other countries having a positive year and end with a good buildup of plans for '17. But our performance in U.K. has been poor, right? The environment has been difficult, but that has been the case for a couple of years. And we really don't see that changing in the next coming months, quarters or even years. I really believe you have been slow to react and get the right price/mix and offering in the marketplace. If you see our market shares, especially on key categories like beans, sauces and others and also, to some smaller degree, fruits, it hasn't changed that much, has been quite solid share performance. But we have been suffering from a category decline and a channel mix change in the country. There is a lot happening now, especially with the new soup season, that size [ph], right now as the winter approach the country. So we're really changing a lot our balanced price, promotion, distribution in this very shaky retailer environment in the U.K. We had a change in leadership in the country as well. We moved our most -- one of the most talented commercials people we had from Australia and New Zealand. That's an even more difficult to concentrate retail environment to the U.K. and Europe to lead our business there. So I'm really confident that we can have a better performance looking at '17 and beyond. We've seen all the seeds of the performance, and that's already happening as we speak. That being said, the mistakes we did on price/mix and distribution are good warning for us to have a much more solid plan coming '17."

Like I mentioned before, it's true that we're -- 50% has been one-offs, like Paulo said, and the fact, but we are working on the categories we have a strong presence like soups and so on, which would come here completely different product offering and volume/mix, promotions and so on. And also, remember that you're coming with other Big Bets looking '17 and beyond, that I think really can move the needle in the country. I think a good example of that would be Heinz Seriously Good Mayo that we just had its start in the last, really, 7, 8 months and is doing quite well from a market share standpoint.

So let me break it down and give you commentary around each one of them. The service issues that we have are restricted to 2 categories, happen to be large categories for us. One is what we call the cold cuts, which is the sliced meats; and the other one is Lunchables. Lunchables is driven by a very, very strong demand. We saw, mid-year, some double-digit growth in that business. And while it's still growing, our ability to supply have been somehow constrained, and we are working now and getting out of it. But the business is still growing. In cold cuts and the sliced meat, we have had capacity issues, and this is the area where we are investing the most in our footprint changes.  We're essentially building brand-new factories -- 2 brand-new factories, one in Davenport, one in Kirksville, as an addition to the factories we have there. And we started working on getting out of the service levels, but that was severely affected with service levels. And we have some distribution losses in some of the customers, and that was jointly managed and agreed between us and our trade partners. And within time, as our ability to supply increases, you will see us moving forward in that. As for the hotdog category, that is a category issue. So our market share is in line with where the category and our growth rate will decline. It's in line with the categories, and we feel very good about our bacon business where we are doing well."

And let me -- what we did over the past few months, we reframed the frozen meal category to broaden the customer base that we are serving. Historically, we only service a very small segment within the broader frozen meal, and that is what we call nutritional, but really, it was the diet segment, the people who are on a diet. And we use the Smart Ones brand to service that consumer segment. We had a look at the category about 7, 8 months ago, and we felt we are in a strong position to broaden the segments we are serving. And essentially, we are servicing now 3 consumer segments. One is the Smart Ones segment and the diet segment for people who are managing weight losses. The second one is the SMARTMADE. It's a slight difference to that one by utilizing more product that are natural or venturing into the real food category while maintaining good calorie content. And the third one is purely on taste, and that is Devour. And we launched in the marketplace only a few months ago. And where it has distribution, we've seen our market share at mid- to high single digit, and it's doing very well. And it's servicing a segment that is -- that -- where weight management and calories is less relevant and taste is the key criteria. So -- and we're very happy where we are so far. That segment, for us, the frozen meal was in a severe decline. And every time we venture in serving new customers, we cut that decline significantly, and we feel very good about its prospect moving forward."

I understand the way you are grouping different things and so on, but I think it's important here to separate. First, on the Rest of the World part, we continue to see, really, very solid near- and long-term growth perspective to the business. As Paulo said, there were temporary behind -- temporary issues behind this quarter like distributors' disruption in Middle East and Africa. We invested much more behind the growth already seen for '17. For example, the launch of Planters in China is a good example and others. So we are -- we were seeing this in a very, I would say, a solid way. On respect of the model, and again, I totally understand your comments, I think there are learnings from the U.K. situation that are really specific to the country. Especially, remember what happened to the U.K. in the last 2 years is that the leader of the retail environment really faced a lot of problems and disconnect to the market for quite some time for different issues. And now it's coming back in a very strong way. And this retail shaking that happened in the country, I truly believe you have not been fast enough on the offerings that are coming. I cannot see any correlation to your question to the model. Given that everything we did, we didn't -- if you see all our lines connected to the market like marketing, selling and other investments, they all grew up in the country in the last 4 years. So from a model standpoint, there is absolutely no correlation. There is a lot of lessons for us. That's your last question. Can you learn from the U.K. and to be applied in other places like the U.S. and others? I -- then I could not agree more. I think they are important lessons from us, for me, for George, for Paulo and for the entire team here that we -- that you're going to need to prepare, especially when you have a situation like happened in the retail or U.K. It's not that very often that, that happens for us to be ahead of the game and not reactive, given the market share and the positions we have in the country. So I think the situation, your bundle are very different. In Rest of the World, I'm investing for more growth. So I'm coming for China with a different plan and coming for Indonesia and coming here from a true markets with whitespace like Australia and New Zealand. In the U.K., it's a different story. My volume/mix and everything I'm working behind my promo activity is to get right what is the offering in my distribution, so I can come back to profitable growth strategy. From a model standpoint, and the question that you cut too much or cut too little, I can't have any correlation, given where it is. Because in a sense, my marketing is going up and my selling is going up within the country. The last criticism I would say to us is to say, ""Hey, if I have not invested as I did this year in U.K., I probably would be better off."" But my offering didn't come true as it should, and I don't think it's the right thing to do as well because we are looking for U.K. for the next 10, 15, 20 years. So the brands we have in the country are so strong, and our record is so solid that we are never going to sacrifice the mid or long term for any short-term gains. We don't do that. So in a sense, I don't think it's a model issue. I think it is, for sure, a question of the balance of product mix and offering. And so -- and those learnings, we should take and apply in other markets."

And we believe we are in a strong position to do so. It's just going to take a little bit of time for us to complete that project.

I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release that I think our third quarter results are very representative of where we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quarter",1078,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release that I think our third quarter results are very representative of where we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quarter, which, one hand, benefit Canada's sales and EBITDA and, in other hand, made Europe's financial results look worse than our internal assessment would indicate. 
Overall, our Q3 results show that we have delivery, respectful financials, but we still have significant room for improvement. We are doing a good job in a difficult environment, working effectively to navigate a combination of headwinds from deflationary commodities to increased retail competition in some of our biggest markets. We are pulling more in-store activity into the marketplace than in the first half, but we're remaining disciplined with our go-to-market activities, balancing price, promotion and distribution while we innovate to drive profitable growth. As a result, we are holding or improving market share in the majority of our categories and our key markets. Much of these is due to our Big Bet strategy and our ability to bend trends and capture whitespace. With the launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in many markets to Heinz BBQ Sauces in the United States, spicy ketchup into new markets and soy sauce expansion in China, our global sauces franchise continues to drive category growth and our share in markets around the world. 
At the more local level, the introduction of Heinz Beanz Creationz lead to more than 2 points of share gain in Australia during Q3. We are now investing behind the launch of Planters in China and Kraft Mac & Cheese in Brazil. And you are seeing some significant trend-bending from our Big Bet in the U.S., thanks to George and his team. That being said, we still have opportunity to turn around several problematic categories, which George and Paulo will highlight in a minute. 
In Europe, in particular, I would add that while our shares are in decent shape overall and whitespace initiatives on the continent are doing well, we have been slow to get the right offering into what is our more competitive and evolving retail environment in the U.K. We are getting more aggressive to jump-start our categories in the country and do expect better results next year.
On the cost front, we remain on track with our savings initiatives. Our integration program delivered roughly $330 million of savings in Q3 or roughly $1.3 billion on a run-rate basis and close to our goal, but we will not stop looking for additional savings. Not only is it important to pour [ph] investment to drive top line growth, it has been the main driver of the 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA in both Q3 and year-to-date. 
Our focus now is to set the table for 2017, delivering high-quality operation results and end-market execution in the fourth quarter as we look to build strong momentum going into next year.
In terms of rate of returns, this is an important time for us internally. We are fully merged in our second annual planning process as a merged company. We continue to grow and learn from each other. And our people are in the process of aligning behind our clear vision by setting challenging goals for 2017. Soon, more than 6,000 Kraft Heinz employees will finalize their objectives for the year ahead, which are cascaded down directly from my objectives in collaboration with our Board of Directors.
This also incorporates specifically KPIs [ph] commitment, including significant cost targets, finalizing our Big Bet initiatives for the year ahead and determining the exact whitespace areas to push into. As a company of owners, we take our commitment in our results personally, and we make it a point to reward those who deliver on their goals. In just the third quarter alone, we promoted more than 550 Kraft Heinz employees. This is what it means to work in a performance-driven culture. It's an exciting time. We feel good about our opportunity to drive profitable growth, and we look forward to updating our expectation for 2017 in the months ahead. 
But now let's turn to Slide 3 to review the Q3 financial results that we are building upon. On the top line, we finally seem to be getting some relief from the foreign exchange headwinds we have been experienced for the past several quarters. In Q3, currency was essentially neutral, only a 0.5 negative versus the roughly 4% point drag we saw in the first half of the year. 
On an organic basis, net sales were down 1 point as pricing turned unfavorable, having been positive in the first half. Versus the prior year, pricing was down 0.7 percentage points, largely reflecting: one, deflation in meat and coffee in the United States and coffee in Canada; two, higher promotion, mainly driven by timing of expenses in Europe as well as step-it-up support behind new product launches in markets around the world. 
Volume/mix was down 0.3 percentage points, an improvement versus the 70 basis point decline we saw in the first half of the year. Versus the prior year, volume/mix reflected the lower shipments, particularly in cold cuts and Foodservice in the United States. This more than offset significant gains from innovation in Lunchables and our Mac and Cheese portfolio in U.S. and continued growth of condiments and sauces globally.
Net EBITDA. We drove strong dollar growth and margin performance year-over-year from a combination of our solid cost savings performance and, to a lesser extent than we saw in the first half, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs in North America. As a side note here, while our Q3 EBITDA margins were down sequentially from Q2 in the first half of the year, this was due to the normal seasonality of our business mix, particularly in North America. In fact, we are quite comfortable with our margin progression and how the year is playing out at the EBITDA line. 
At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up almost 90% versus the prior period to $0.83. This reflects 3 factors: one, our solid EBITDA growth; two, the benefits from refinancing the preferred stock; and three, lower taxes driven by some discrete items coming into play in the current period.
Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reporting segment and what we're expecting going forward. George?"
278212,404700828,1076546,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transf",549,"Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and our performance in the United States. Consistent with our goals for the year, in Q3, we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transformation of our business. First and foremost, our new product initiatives are working well and having a measurable impact. Our Mac and Cheese innovation is bringing people back into the category, boosting consumption and household penetration. Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meals are addressing previously unserved segments of the market. Capri Sun Organic continues to build distribution and is doing well. Our Heinz sauces business had a very successful summer season, led by our new Heinz BBQ Sauces and the second year of Heinz Mustard. And in cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese continues to grow strongly, and we're seeing good improvement in the natural cheese segment.
We also expect the impact of our new product activities to build into Q4, with advertising about to go live behind the launch of VELVEETA Mini Blocks and our all-natural Jell-O Simply Good dry packaged dessert. 
The second factor I would highlight is our Q3 shipments versus consumption bridge where we continue to see improvement. As you can see in the chart, our categories were essentially flat, and our main challenge continued to be net market share losses. Behind the numbers, I can tell you that more than 80% of our impact from share losses are due to cold cuts, roast and ground coffee and snack nuts, a significantly shorter list than we've seen in the past. And in each of these areas, we either have initiatives already in the marketplace or soon to be launched to reverse those trends. So overall, we are feeling good about our momentum in measured channels. 
With regard to non-measured channels and changes in the retail inventory, there are 3 things at work: First, we continue to see strong growth in non-measured retail channels like club and value stores. Second, we continue to add new Foodservice customers as we go after whitespace opportunities. However, total Foodservice in Q3 was down slightly due to the traffic decline that you've heard about from the restaurant company as well as some proactive trimming of less profitable contracts in our ingredients business. And third, we had new product pipeline shipments of the VELVEETA and Jell-O innovations that I mentioned as well as a few others that benefited Q3 shipment. 
The final piece of my update is our integration program where we are well under way and, more importantly, on plan. During Q3, we maintained 98% case fill rate despite some service issues that continued to negatively impact cold cuts and Lunchables and held back our sales in those 2 parts of the business. That being said, we are improving those service issues in Q4. More importantly, the overall integration project will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond from simplifying our network and colocating similar types of production lines to modernizing our production processes and improving product quality.
In summary, we have a full plate of opportunities to drive profitable growth in our U.S. business, and I look forward to updating you in coming quarters. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments."
278212,404700828,1076546,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 poi",1536,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. 
In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 points of key commodity deflation, mainly in meats and coffee. 
Volume/mix was down 0.5 percentage points, an improvement from the 1.5% decline we saw in the first half of the year.
We delivered strong gains from innovation, led by Lunchables and our Mac and Cheese innovation as well as improved volume and mix benefits in our coffee business. But these were offset by lower shipments in cold cuts, Foodservice and nuts. 
In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margins, while margins were down sequentially due to normal seasonality of the U.S. business, significant year-over-year growth and margin expansion was similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. This was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs. While we've seen the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the first 9 months of the year, we expect commodities' favorability to fade even more in the fourth quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 and the significant gains we saw in Canada's Q3 numbers. Currency turned neutral on the top line and was a small benefit to EBITDA in the quarter, much better than the significant drag it was in the first half of the year.
Organically, volume/mix swung to 3.4 percentage points of growth, up from negative 2 percentage points in the first half and driving Q3 organic net sales growth of 2%. By contrast, pricing was down 1.4 percentage points, having been up 3.4 percentage points in the first half of the year, due to commodity-driven pricing actions in coffee. 
Now before we get to EBITDA, I have to note that the Q3 volume/mix gains were driven by a combination of early events-related shipments versus the prior year and Foodservice gains. And while the gains in Foodservice have a good chance of repeating, we are likely to give back a good portion of the positive Q3 volume/mix in Q4. 
At the top line, adjusted EBITDA was up 32.7% versus the year-ago period in constant currency terms. This was driven by a combination of gains from cost-savings initiatives and the favorable volume/mix I just described. I would also note that consistent with what we said on our last call, there was no material impact at EBITDA from key commodities in Q3, and I will add that we may see it turn into an unfavorable impact in Q4. 
That brings us to Europe on Slide 7. Overall, it's fair to say that we've been up and down in Europe over the past few quarters. Results this quarter were sequentially worse than Q2 after Q2 was sequentially better than Q1. However, we do not believe that the underlying trends are as bad as the Q3 numbers suggest. 
Let me deconstruct the results to give a clear picture of underlying trends. Pricing was down 2.9 percentage points, primarily due to the timing of promotional expenses versus the prior year. Volume/mix decreased 4.9 percentage points, reflecting a combination of shipment timing versus the prior year and ongoing consumption weakness in several categories, primarily in U.K. and Netherlands. So from both a pricing and volume/mix perspective, roughly half of the decline in each was due to timing that we would not expect to repeat going forward.
As a result of the factors I just described, we saw constant-currency EBITDA and margins down slightly, both on a sequential basis and versus the prior year. This reflected the combination of unfavorable volume/mix and pricing I just described and increased marketing investments that offset ongoing manufacturing savings. And again, roughly half of the constant-currency decline was due to timing that we do not expect to repeat.
So overall, we think that the health of our European business is better than our Q3 numbers indicate. And with some changes in the works, we expect the business to be a meaningful contributor in 2017. 
Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on Slide 8. Here, for the first quarter in many, foreign currency was not a significant headwind. In fact, it was slightly positive as we lapped recognition of Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
In terms of organic growth, we saw some deceleration versus the second quarter. Much of it came from pricing, which increased 1.9 percentage points. While this was driven by pricing to offset higher input costs in local currency, particularly in Latin America, it also included higher promotional spending to support new product initiatives like launching Planters in China and relaunching our soy sauces line in Indonesia. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced less local input cost inflation to offset with pricing as well as a step-up in support behind new product activity. And we would expect each of these factors to come into play in the near term.
Volume/mix was up 1.7 percentage points versus last year, again, a deceleration from the first half, primarily reflecting 3 factors: one, continuing strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions; two, a decline in our ABC soy sauce business in Indonesia; and three, a temporary disruption in distribution within our Middle East and Africa business due to retailer consolidation in the region.
Overall, while we did see some deceleration in sales this quarter, going forward, we expect the distribution issues to be resolved and have investments in place to accelerate growth. So we don't see any reason to change our expectations for a strong growth in our Rest of the World business, either in the near term or longer term.
At adjusted EBITDA, it was down 3.9% in constant-currency terms as organic sales growth was not enough to offset higher input costs in local currency and our investments in new product initiatives. In a sense, we invested in Q3 ahead of growth. Going forward, while we face a strong comparison in Q4, we do expect better performance at the EBITDA line in our Rest of the World business in 2017.
Now before we go to Q&A, on Slide 9, I want to cover a few more factors that may impact our financial performance over the near to medium term. To start, and more as a reminder than a comment on our operating performance, from a comparisons perspective, I think it's important to note one specific factor that will affect our Q4 results. That is, we will experience comparisons to Q4 2015 that included a 53rd week of shipments. Recall that when we reported Q4 2015 results, we mentioned that the 53rd week benefited net sales by 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA by 4.5 percentage points.
The second factor I want to highlight is our expectations around our integration program. Right now, we are keeping all of our targets the same, savings and costs to achieve. We are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, by 2017. As we've said before, savings have come in faster than we expected, and we do expect that input cost inflation outside of key commodity costs in North America is likely to be a partial offset to savings going forward, especially as 2017 progresses. That said, as Bernardo mentioned, we are currently firming up our 2017 plans, both costs and savings expectations, so we'll be in a better position to provide a more robust update in the coming months.
Along those lines, we are also finalizing our plans and investments behind our 2017 pipeline of Big Bet and whitespace initiatives to drive profitable growth. Based on what we've already seen in the marketplace, we remain confident in our ability to drive improvement in our top line trends in existing markets and invest behind whitespace expansion opportunities for Kraft and Heinz brands in both Foodservice and international channels. And we look forward to talking about these initiatives in the months ahead. 
The last item I want to highlight is our progress and our expectations with regard to debt leverage. To the end of Q3, we have reduced our leverage to the 3.7 to 3.8 range, and this is down from roughly 4.5 only a year ago. So we are making great progress on our goal to achieve below 3x ratio over the medium term, and we expect this to continue at a strong pace as we move forward. This includes fulfilling our commitment to pay off $2 billion of debt when it matures next year. 
That completes our update to the third quarter of 2016. There were certainly a number of puts and takes in our Q3 results. But overall, the progress we've continued to make improving our operations and performance in the marketplace gives us confidence that the profitable growth we've delivered to date is sustainable and that we can build on this going forward. Our focus from here is to finalize a strong agenda for 2017 and finish 2016 in a way that gives us good momentum heading into the next year.

I really don't think the U.K. performance, and I want to comment about that in a minute, has anything to do with the level of spend or that we cut too much or the model that's -- I can guarantee you, I really don't see that way. What I think is important when it's to Europe and especially the U.K. that you mentioned is to separate because we continue to have a solid performance in Continental Europe, okay? With the exception of the Netherlands, I would say all other countries having a positive year and end with a good buildup of plans for '17. But our performance in U.K. has been poor, right? The environment has been difficult, but that has been the case for a couple of years. And we really don't see that changing in the next coming months, quarters or even years. I really believe you have been slow to react and get the right price/mix and offering in the marketplace. If you see our market shares, especially on key categories like beans, sauces and others and also, to some smaller degree, fruits, it hasn't changed that much, has been quite solid share performance. But we have been suffering from a category decline and a channel mix change in the country. There is a lot happening now, especially with the new soup season, that size [ph], right now as the winter approach the country. So we're really changing a lot our balanced price, promotion, distribution in this very shaky retailer environment in the U.K. We had a change in leadership in the country as well. We moved our most -- one of the most talented commercials people we had from Australia and New Zealand. That's an even more difficult to concentrate retail environment to the U.K. and Europe to lead our business there. So I'm really confident that we can have a better performance looking at '17 and beyond. We've seen all the seeds of the performance, and that's already happening as we speak. That being said, the mistakes we did on price/mix and distribution are good warning for us to have a much more solid plan coming '17."

I think a good example of that would be Heinz Seriously Good Mayo that we just had its start in the last, really, 7, 8 months and is doing quite well from a market share standpoint.

One is what we call the cold cuts, which is the sliced meats; and the other one is Lunchables. Lunchables is driven by a very, very strong demand. We saw, mid-year, some double-digit growth in that business. And while it's still growing, our ability to supply have been somehow constrained, and we are working now and getting out of it. But the business is still growing. In cold cuts and the sliced meat, we have had capacity issues, and this is the area where we are investing the most in our footprint changes.  We're essentially building brand-new factories -- 2 brand-new factories, one in Davenport, one in Kirksville, as an addition to the factories we have there. And we started working on getting out of the service levels, but that was severely affected with service levels. And we have some distribution losses in some of the customers, and that was jointly managed and agreed between us and our trade partners. And within time, as our ability to supply increases, you will see us moving forward in that. As for the hotdog category, that is a category issue.

Historically, we only service a very small segment within the broader frozen meal, and that is what we call nutritional, but really, it was the diet segment, the people who are on a diet. And we use the Smart Ones brand to service that consumer segment. We had a look at the category about 7, 8 months ago, and we felt we are in a strong position to broaden the segments we are serving. And essentially, we are servicing now 3 consumer segments. One is the Smart Ones segment and the diet segment for people who are managing weight losses. The second one is the SMARTMADE. It's a slight difference to that one by utilizing more product that are natural or venturing into the real food category while maintaining good calorie content. And the third one is purely on taste, and that is Devour. And we launched in the marketplace only a few months ago. And where it has distribution, we've seen our market share at mid- to high single digit, and it's doing very well. And it's servicing a segment that is -- that -- where weight management and calories is less relevant and taste is the key criteria. So -- and we're very happy where we are so far.

I think it's a stated comment, but I do believe that you've got some manufacturing plans that will still -- that are slated to be closed but will occur in 2017. So I'm a little bit confused on exactly when all the ""integration efforts"" are done. The purpose of the question is just to ask when do you have capacity such that you could start to contemplate another deal and that you would have the capacity to actually begin an integration. Does that make sense?"

I already announced and planned, so it's actually going quite well. George mentioned here the 2 facilities that we're building on the meat side, but you have others on the warehousing and other categories that we are expanding. And so all this work, it goes up to 2017 as planned. So that's not changed. Our important milestones and integration, that's already behind us like the systems and already operating all the planning on the commercial side and analytics in the same environment. So it's really, Kraft Heinz, I would say, already operate as one and most part of the issues we had behind us. On your question about readiness in M&A, we never like to comment on hypothetical. And we really believe we have a solid, organic path here to create value, and we are working really hard on it. That being said, we also believe our model is highly scalable, and I think the integration results of Kraft Heinz are proving it. So I want for us to do on a day to day, and we want to be focused on that for now."

And I know U.K.'s got some unique situations. But still, you combine those 2 businesses, which are probably our best approximation of a legacy Heinz, and EBITDA is down 11%. And I think some will look at that and say, ""Gosh, is there a risk that 2 years from now North America looks similar?"" So I was hoping maybe you could comment on some of those, what I think will be questions from some investors and also maybe add on top of that some of what you've learned from those markets that you're playing in North America to ensure that the North America growth is more sustainable."

I understand the way you are grouping different things and so on, but I think it's important here to separate. First, on the Rest of the World part, we continue to see, really, very solid near- and long-term growth perspective to the business. As Paulo said, there were temporary behind -- temporary issues behind this quarter like distributors' disruption in Middle East and Africa. We invested much more behind the growth already seen for '17. For example, the launch of Planters in China is a good example and others. So we are -- we were seeing this in a very, I would say, a solid way. On respect of the model, and again, I totally understand your comments, I think there are learnings from the U.K. situation that are really specific to the country. Especially, remember what happened to the U.K. in the last 2 years is that the leader of the retail environment really faced a lot of problems and disconnect to the market for quite some time for different issues. And now it's coming back in a very strong way. And this retail shaking that happened in the country, I truly believe you have not been fast enough on the offerings that are coming. I cannot see any correlation to your question to the model. Given that everything we did, we didn't -- if you see all our lines connected to the market like marketing, selling and other investments, they all grew up in the country in the last 4 years. So from a model standpoint, there is absolutely no correlation. There is a lot of lessons for us. That's your last question. Can you learn from the U.K. and to be applied in other places like the U.S. and others? I -- then I could not agree more. I think they are important lessons from us, for me, for George, for Paulo and for the entire team here that we -- that you're going to need to prepare, especially when you have a situation like happened in the retail or U.K. It's not that very often that, that happens for us to be ahead of the game and not reactive, given the market share and the positions we have in the country. So I think the situation, your bundle are very different. In Rest of the World, I'm investing for more growth. So I'm coming for China with a different plan and coming for Indonesia and coming here from a true markets with whitespace like Australia and New Zealand. In the U.K., it's a different story. My volume/mix and everything I'm working behind my promo activity is to get right what is the offering in my distribution, so I can come back to profitable growth strategy. From a model standpoint, and the question that you cut too much or cut too little, I can't have any correlation, given where it is. Because in a sense, my marketing is going up and my selling is going up within the country. The last criticism I would say to us is to say, ""Hey, if I have not invested as I did this year in U.K., I probably would be better off."" But my offering didn't come true as it should, and I don't think it's the right thing to do as well because we are looking for U.K. for the next 10, 15, 20 years. So the brands we have in the country are so strong, and our record is so solid that we are never going to sacrifice the mid or long term for any short-term gains. We don't do that. So in a sense, I don't think it's a model issue. I think it is, for sure, a question of the balance of product mix and offering. And so -- and those learnings, we should take and apply in other markets."

If you remember, I ran that business 6 years ago, and this is when we made the step change in cheese. And since then, we never looked back, and you've been seeing the results of that. We're actually repeating very similar model in the meats business. And what we're trying to do, we're trying to get 2 things at once: one, modernize the manufacturing capability and the technology to be able to make the products of the future rather than the products of the past; and two, try to get a cost advantage compared to anyone in the marketplace. And we believe we are in a strong position to do so. It's just going to take a little bit of time for us to complete that project. And once we are out of it, no different to the model we did in cheese when we modernized and reduced our costs and became world class, cost effective in it.

And so we do not just have one view of promotional activities and we go and implement it. So if you look deeper into our sales, if you go 1 layer down or 2 or 3, you would find a very different direction, and that's why we try not to take as an overall view, whether it's going up or down. And as for the investments moving forward, we would continue exactly utilizing that same strategy. What we're finding, though, it's not just the promotional activities or the sales generated from promotional activities rather than the return that we get from promotional activity. We have become, through data analytics, a lot more competent in the ability to select which promotion and which category with which account. And we're finding very, very different returns. And that, by itself, is allowing us to actually do more with less. So we're not going to somebody and just saying, ""We're cutting across-the-board promotional activities."" We're just doing more with less."
