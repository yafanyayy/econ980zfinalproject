This morning, Delta reported a $1.45 billion pretax profit and delivered earnings per share of $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result marks a 42% improvement year-on-year and was in line with consensus",1151,"Thank you, Jill. 
Good morning, everyone. This morning, Delta reported a $1.45 billion pretax profit and delivered earnings per share of $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result marks a 42% improvement year-on-year and was in line with consensus expectations. For the full year, we generated a $5.9 billion pretax profit, an increase of 29% over 2014. We grew our top line by 1% and realized substantial fuel savings, which allowed us to expand operating margins by over 3 points to 16.2%.
Our return on invested capital was 28.3% for 2015. We generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $2.6 billion of that back to our owners this year. 
Our 2015 performance ranks Delta among the top 10% of S&P industrials. We are poised to continue not performing as low fuel prices will allow us to produce further earnings and margin expansion in 2016 in the face of a strong dollar and some global economic uncertainty.
I want to thank the entire Delta team for all their hard work that contributed to another record year in 2015. For their efforts, we accrued $1.5 billion in profit-sharing for the full year 2015. We are looking forward to our largest profit-sharing payout in our history on Valentine's Day 2016. Our people are the primary reason Delta is the top-performing airline in the world, and we are thankful for their commitment to our company. 
Our foundation at Delta is quite strong. Similar to other high quality industrial companies, our focus is to drive value for our owners through top line growth, margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and prudent deployment of our strong cash generation. As we highlighted at the Investor Day last month, we have built a durable business model that can deliver strong results throughout the economic cycle. 
We continue to run the best operations by a wide margin of all the airlines in the world with a full year completion factor of 99.6% and an on-time rate of 85.9%. We had 161 100% mainline completion factor days in 2015, which significantly outpaces American, United and Southwest even if you combine their operations for the last several years. That operational excellence along with the investments we've made in products and services drove increases in our customer satisfaction, with year-to-date domestic Net Promoter Score increasing more than 4 points to 38% compared to 2014.
The 4Q results show that high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry. We are consistently generating 108% of industry average revenues across our system and north of 114% in the domestic entity. Through our capacity actions and commercial initiatives, we offset nearly $700 million of currency pressure this year and held our top line revenues intact year-on-year. This performance allowed us to capture more than 75% of the fuel savings in 2015, which should show strong margin improvements. 
We expect to improve upon this great performance in 2016. The scale and scope of our network allow us to focus on regions of strength, adjust capacity in regions that are economically challenged and move our capital assets to markets with strong returns. As we continue to globalize our network through our uniquely Delta joint ventures and equity investments, we will further enhance the flexibility and durability of our business, which will allow us to continue to drive strong revenue margin and cash flow growth for our owners over the long term.
Our focus on our long-term goal is unwavering. We will continue to invest in the business at an appropriate level to sustain long-term growth. That disciplined reinvestment has delivered high levels of returns to our owners. The substantial free cash flow we are generating allows us to continue to derisk the balance sheet. Our adjusted net debt declined $600 million to $6.7 billion in 2015, which is more than $10 billion lower than when we started almost a decade ago. And we think an investment-grade rating will occur in 2016.
At the same time, we are accelerating capital returns to our shareholders and repurchased 7% of our market cap in 2015. Including the dividend, this is the equivalent of 70% of our free cash flow going back to our owners, well above our 50% long-term target. 
We remain strongly committed to exceeding our long-term commitments to our owners. You will recall from our Investor Day, our long-term goal is to sustain operating margins of 14% to 16%, to have EPS growth year-on-year at 15%, to maintain a return on invested capital of 20% to 25%, to generate at least $7 billion to $8 billion of operating cash flow and at least $4 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow, and to reach $4 billion in adjusted net debt by 2020. We expect to significantly exceed these goals in 2016. We have a significant opportunity in 2016 as the decline in fuel prices will provide us with a $3 billion tailwind in 2016 at current levels. Low fuel prices do put some pressure on our unit revenues, which we saw throughout 2015.
It is important for us to produce unit revenue improvements, and we are committed to doing so in 2016. However, our capacity discipline and service excellence are contributing to unit revenue outperformance for Delta relative to the industry. We expect to grow capacity between 0 and 2% in 2016 in appropriate level of growth to balance capital investment with supply and demand and ensure the momentum in our business continues. 
Strong nonfuel cost discipline is critical to our long-term success. In 2015, we kept our nonfuel costs flat. Since the merger, we have grown nonfuel costs in the rate of less than 2% on an annual basis while investing significantly in our people, customers, operation, fleet and product. 
We are on track to meet or exceed the targets we laid out for you last May at our Investor Day of growing annual EPS greater than 15% and achieving returns on capital in excess of 20% and generating free cash flow in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion in 2016. We have consistently achieved our long-term goals. We will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices. 
Our first quarter 2016 performance will break all records as we expect an operating margin of 18% to 20% in what is seasonality Delta's lower-margin quarter. As we lay out the framework for 2016 and beyond, we see big opportunities ahead for our business. The key message of our Investor Day last month was that we are high quality industrial company built to deliver consistent and sustainable returns through the cycle. We believe executing on this commitment should result in a premium valuation that is in line with our peers who produce financial results similar to Delta. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed to go through the details in the quarter. Thank you."

For the December quarter, our pretax income increased 42% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. We expanded our operating margin more than 4.5 points to 17.1%. We are able to drive a significant improvement in our margins because we were disciplined and strategic about our growth, which allowed us to capture more than 75% of the savings from lower fuel prices. For the quarter, we saw a 5-point improvement in domestic margins, while international margins improved by 4 points. 
Thanks to our Delta employees for their contributions to another strong quarter, performance that drove a profit-sharing accrual of nearly $400 million, bringing full year total to $1.5 billion. 2015 was another record year on all fronts, and we look forward to rewarding the Delta team for driving industry-leading operational and financial results on February 12. We have the best employees in the industry driving superior performance, which allows us to pay industry-leading total compensation.
Our revenues declined 2 points for the quarter versus the prior year driven by a $160 million headwind from foreign exchange, which means we are able to successfully push most of these fuel savings to the bottom line.
Corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 3%. Domestic continues to be strong, particularly in the transcon West Coast markets. Corporate travel buyers named Delta the leading airline for the fifth consecutive year, rating us #1 in the Business Travel News Annual Airline survey. This is the first time BTA voters, who manage tens of billions of dollars in annual travel spend, have selected the same airline for 5 years in a row. 
We continue investing in our ability to upsell in delta.com which is driving our accelerated revenue growth. We have strong momentum with our plan to make our products available to all Delta customers with the recent introduction of Delta Comfort+ as a fare product and our first mover branded fares launch with Expedia media. Sales of Comfort+ increased nearly 60% to $125 million in the quarter. And we see significant opportunity ahead now that we have started selling the product as a separate fare class. First class upsell increased 20% driven by a 6-point paid load factor improvement.
Our agreement with American Express produced over $100 million in incremental value again this quarter and more than $400 million in incremental value for the year.
For the December quarter, our passenger unit revenues declined 1.6% as our winter capacity actions and holiday demand strength offset foreign currency and domestic yield headwinds. This result was better than our initial guide due to stronger demand than we had anticipated during the peak holiday season. Domestic unit revenues declined approximately 1 point as the yield environment remains competitive, similar to what we have been experiencing for most of the year.
Overall, the domestic business is performing well. We remain focused on expanding service in higher-margin areas within our networks such as New York, Seattle and Los Angeles, which is also contributing to our RASM premium to our competitors. Atlanta also performed well, with domestic RASM outpacing the system average despite competitive capacity growth in our largest hub.  
Our international business continues to face headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges, and we are seeing the benefits of the capacity reductions we have made in our performance. The trans-Atlantic entity saw unit revenues decline 4 points, entirely driven by FX and surcharges. The Paris attacks caused a 0.5-point reduction in our Atlantic RASM in the quarter, roughly $10 million impact. Core European market demand held up reasonably well in the quarter, and the capacity actions we have implemented in Africa, the Middle East and Russia helped results. Our joint ventures with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic continued to see margin expansion despite currency pressures and increased competitive capacity. 
In Latin America, our unit were down 7 points just to currency, primarily in Brazil. Our capacity growth in the region was flat, and we are focusing our growth on bright spots like Mexico and Caribbean, while reducing capacity in challenging markets like Brazil. 
During the quarter, we now started our intent to increase our stake in Aeromexico to up to 49%. We expect to close the transaction during the June quarter. This investment will bring the companies closer and allow us to participate in the financial improvements the Aeroméxico team can deliver going forward in addition to the benefits we realize from our commercial partnership.
In the Pacific, unit revenues declined 3%, a solid improvement for what we were trending earlier in the year, helped by our significant network restructuring. Currency and fuel surcharges were a 13-point drag on unit revenue in the quarter. Pacific profitability improved again, with margins up by 3 points this quarter.
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We'll continue to leverage those opportunities with the greatest profit potential in our network, while adjusting capacity in challenging regions. We currently expect capacity growth of 2% to 3% growth for the first quarter and 0 to 2% for the full year. Remember that our first quarter capacity includes 1 point of growth from . We are planning for roughly 4% to 5% growth in the domestic region during the first quarter and 1% to 3% growth for the full year, in line with how we see demand and economic growth in the U.S. Domestic growth will come predominantly from higher gauge and targeting those markets where our past investments are allowing us to drive revenue and margin improvements.
Our margin-accretive upgauging actions will continue as we'll take out an additional 40- and 50-seaters in 2016 while adding seats to 23% of our narrow body fleet. International capacity will decline 2% to 3% this quarter as the large reductions we've made during the fourth quarter in places like Japan, Brazil, Russia and the Middle East remain in place. For the year, we expect our international capacity to be flat to down 2 points.
Domestically, the demand environment remains solid, although we continue to see yield pressure during the off-peak parts of the quarter, primarily in January and early February. This trend is consistent with what we have seen in the domestic entity over the last 6 months. 
Internationally, we expect the currency headwinds we have experienced in the December quarter to persist at similar levels in the March quarter, but begin to improve thereafter. In addition, we have seen further surcharge reductions through Q4 as fuel prices move lower.
Europe continues to see in April following the events in Paris in November, and we have slowed our capacity growth into the region. We expect this will be roughly a 0.5 point headwind for system revenue for the quarter. 
In the Pacific, we expect to see good improvement of profitability again in 2016 as we reallocate additional capacity for Japan to growth markets, primarily China, an important pillar of our Pacific and overall company long-term strategy. We'll also benefit from downgauging efforts in the Pacific, and we'll retire the 9 remaining 747s in our fleet at the end of next year. 
We expect overall system unit revenues to decline 2.5% to 4.5% for the March quarter, which includes a 1.5-point headwind from currency. We expect the off-peak periods in January and February to be more challenging than March when we'll benefit from Easter and spring break.  We expect unit revenue trends to stabilize this summer. While lower fuel prices have resulted in RASM declines for longer than we expected, we are getting significantly larger cost savings from fuel driving strong margin and cash flow improvements. And as a result, we expect a record first quarter with an operating margin of 18% to 20%, roughly 10-point improvement from the prior first quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Paul, who'll go through the details in cost and cash flow."
266311,321967369,919253,"Delta Air Lines, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Delta Air Lines, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everybody.

Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to roughly $570 million decline in",795,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us today. 
I'll start by highlighting another strong cost performance by the Delta team this quarter. Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to roughly $570 million decline in total operating expenses despite nearly $120 million in higher profit share. Nonoperating expenses declined by $9 million, even with the $75 million loss associated with the write-off of our remaining Venezuelan currency exposure, which was included in our results. Nonfuel CASM increased 1.9% on flat capacity, including about 1 point of pressure from the pay raises we implemented in early December. That was offset by a little more than 1 point due to the currency benefits on the expense line.
As we have said previously, we have built a good foundation for cost productivity, and we will continue to benefit from several of our ongoing initiatives, including upgauging for several more years. Modifications on 20% of the fleet, as Ed mentioned, during the early innings including 757s, A, A319 and CRJ 700.
You should remember that in conjunction with the December 1 wage increase for most of our employees, we made a change to our profit-sharing plan, which affects our CASM due to the geography shift. Given the timing of those increases in 2015, our core costs will be weighted towards the front half of 2016. We expect nonfuel CASM including profit sharing to increase roughly 5% for the first quarter, with approximately half of that growth driven by year-over-year profit share. 
For the fourth quarter, our total fuel expense declined by over $700 million, driven by lower mark to -- lower market fuel prices, which was net of $340 million in hedge losses including early settlements. Our all-in fuel price was $1.85 per gallon, down 30% from the prior year. 
The refinery contributed $8 million this quarter versus $105 million on the same period in 2014. The decline was primarily driven by considerably lower distillate cracks, which are of a substantial benefit to the airline, but a headwind for the refinery.
We currently expect our March quarter fuel expense to be $1.5 million lower year-over-year, given the significantly lower hedge losses and the continued decline in market fuel prices. For the full year, we expect our fuel expense will be $3 billion lower than 2015. And we are forecasting an all-in first quarter fuel price of $1.10 to $1.20 based on last week's prices. 
As a result of the uncertainty in the markets, we closed out our hedge book and have full participation to further downward movements in 2016.  For the full year, we expect our hedge losses to be in the $100 million to $200 million range per quarter and throughout the year.
Moving on to cash flow, we're using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the investments we're making in the business for the long term while also derisking the balance sheet. Also, we are increasing our returns to our shareholders. This quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, just over $1 billion of which we reinvested into the business, including 6 slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport as well as aircraft acquisitions and continued fleet modifications. For the first quarter, we expect capital spending to again be roughly $1 billion. For the full year, we expect our core CapEx to be approximately $3 billion with over -- a little bit higher in the first half of the year primarily due to the timing of aircraft spend. 
During the quarter, we returned $530 million to shareholders and expect to return a similar level of cash to our owners during the first quarter. For 2015 full year, we returned $2.6 billion, which equates to approximately 7% of our market cap, $360 million was paid in the form of dividends, with the remaining $2.2 billion returned through repurchases. We bought back a total of 48 million shares of our stock at an average price of $45.50.
Adjusted net debt at the end of December was $6.7 billion. Debt reduction was the biggest driver of $35 million in lower interest expense for the quarter relative to last year and $170 million below 2014 levels for the full year. Additionally, our pension liability declined by $1.3 billion as a result of a 50% -- 50 basis point increase in the discount rate. We remain committed to behaving as a high value, cash return focused, investment-grade company going forward, and we are optimistic that an investment-grade rating is in sight this year. 
In closing, I'd like to echo Richard and Ed's comments and thank the entire Delta team for another record 2015. These results don't come easy. They come through hard work, and we look forward to celebrating with them next month. Thank you.

We have a bias to holding our core CapEx capital at around the $3 billion number. And the reason why is that is really the optimal number that we can execute on any given 12-month period and have high confidence of delivering the benefits on the timeline we lay out. So that really is the to our capital allocation strategy. We do believe that we're going to have a substantially better operating cash flows because lower fuel prices is very good for our business overall. We have a bias towards applying that to share buyback. So I think it's reasonable to expect, just as we said in our prepared remarks, that in 2015, we hit nearly 7% of returning our cash to our owners. And I would expect that -- we would expect that given the performance that we're on pace to achieve, that our share buyback number will be materially higher in 2016 than it was 2015. Now also understand that we're going to close the Aeromexico transaction, expect it to close in the first half of the year, which will drive about $800 million of cash, but that will have a quick and immediate return just as our investment in Virgin did. So core CapEx at $3 billion, we have the Aeromexico investment coming, but longer term, our bias is to put the money in share buyback."

Our revenues were down about 2 points, but that was almost entirely due to the FX impact on international. So by definition, we drove the recovery of savings to fuel to the bottom line, or certainly the vast majority of it. As fuel continues to decline, that continues to put some incremental pressure on it. But the pricing environment where we stand today is allowing us to do that because we're taking some pretty aggressive network actions to accommodate. So maybe one other way to think about this is if you look at full year 2015 results, and we expect to be able to repeat this, at least this performance in 2016, in 2015, our operating revenues were up 1%. So top line was up 1%. Our fuel expenses were down 20%, and our EPS was up 38%. We took a lot of that to the bottom line.

And they said they seem to be to willing to reinvest that into in airline purchases but at slightly lower fares. And those lower fares are being generated by lower price of fuel.

We could always step back when the economic conditions change. the investments this year are really in filling out the things we started before, continuing to get Kennedy to its full 250 departures a day.

Good morning, everyone. This morning, Delta reported a $1.45 billion pretax profit and delivered earnings per share of $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result marks a 42% improvement year-on-year and was in line with consensus expectations. For the full year, we generated a $5.9 billion pretax profit, an increase of 29% over 2014. We grew our top line by 1% and realized substantial fuel savings, which allowed us to expand operating margins by over 3 points to 16.2%. Our return on invested capital was 28.3% for 2015. We generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $2.6 billion of that back to our owners this year. 
Our 2015 performance ranks Delta among the top 10% of S&P industrials. We are poised to continue outperforming as low fuel prices will allow us to produce further earnings and margin expansion in 2016 in the face of a strong dollar and some global economic uncertainty.
I want to thank the entire Delta team for all their hard work that contributed to another record year in 2015. For their efforts, we accrued $1.5 billion in profit-sharing for the full year 2015. We are looking forward to our largest profit-sharing payout in our history on Valentine's Day 2016. Our people are the primary reason Delta is the top-performing airline in the world and we are thankful for their commitment to our company. 
Our foundation at Delta is quite strong. Similar to other high-quality industrial companies, our focus is to drive value for our owners through top line growth, margin expansion, double-digit EPS growth and prudent deployment of our strong cash generation. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we have built a durable business model that can deliver strong results throughout the economic cycle. 
We continue to run the best operations by a wide margin of all the airlines in the world with a full year completion factor of 99.6% and an on-time rate of 85.9%. We had 161 100% mainline completion factor days in 2015, which significantly outpaces American, United and Southwest even if you combine their operations for the last several years. That operational excellence, along with the investments we've made in products and services, drove increases in our customer satisfaction with year-to-date domestic Net Promoter Score increasing more than 4 points to 38% compared to 2014.
The 4Q results show again that high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry. We are consistently generating 108% of industry average revenues across our system and north of 114% in the domestic entity. Through our capacity actions and commercial initiatives, we offset nearly $700 million of currency pressure this year and held our top line revenues intact year-on-year. This performance allowed us to capture more than 75% of the fuel savings in 2015, which drove strong margin improvements. 
We expect to improve upon this great performance in 2016. The scale and scope of our network allow us to focus on regions of strength, adjust capacity in regions that are economically challenged and move our capital assets to markets with strong returns. As we continue to globalize our network through our uniquely Delta joint ventures and equity investments, we will further enhance the flexibility and durability of our business, which will allow us to continue to drive strong revenue margin and cash flow growth for our owners over the long term.
Our focus on our long-term goals is unwavering. We will continue to reinvest in the business at an appropriate level to sustain long-term growth. That disciplined reinvestment has delivered high levels of returns to our owners. The substantial free cash flow we are generating allows us to continue to derisk the balance sheet. Our adjusted net debt declined $600 million to $6.7 billion in 2015, which is more than $10 billion lower than when we started almost a decade ago, and we think an investment-grade rating will occur in 2016.
At the same time, we are accelerating capital returns to our shareholders and repurchased 7% of our market cap in 2015. Including the dividend, this is the equivalent of 70% of our free cash flow going back to our owners, well above our 50% long-term target. 
We remain strongly committed to exceeding our long-term commitments to our owners. You'll recall from our Investor Day our long-term goal is to sustain operating margins of 14% to 16%, to have EPS growth year-on-year at 15%, to maintain a return on invested capital of 20% to 25%, to generate at least $7 billion to $8 billion of operating cash flow and at least $4 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow and to reach $4 billion in adjusted net debt by 2020. We expect to significantly exceed these goals in 2016. We have a significant opportunity in 2016 as the decline in fuel prices will provide us with a $3 billion tailwind in 2016 at current levels. Low fuel prices do put some pressure on our unit revenues, which we saw throughout 2015.
It is important for us to produce unit revenue improvements and we are committed to doing so in 2016. However, our capacity discipline and service excellence are contributing to unit revenue outperformance for Delta relative to the industry. We expect to grow capacity between 0 and 2% in 2016, an appropriate level of growth to balance capital investment with supply and demand and ensure the momentum in our business continues. 
Strong nonfuel cost discipline is critical to our long-term success. In 2015, we kept our nonfuel costs flat. Since the merger, we have grown nonfuel costs at a rate of less than 2% on an annual basis while investing significantly in our people, customers, operation, fleet and product. 
We are on track to meet or exceed the targets we laid out for you last May at our Investor Day of growing annual EPS greater than 15% and achieving returns on capital in excess of 20% and generating free cash flow in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion in 2016. We have consistently achieved our long-term goals. We will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices. 
Our first quarter 2016 performance will break all records as we expect an operating margin of 18% to 20% in what is seasonally Delta's lower-margin quarter. As we lay out the framework for 2016 and beyond, we see big opportunities ahead for our business. The key message of our Investor Day last month was that we are a high-quality industrial company built to deliver consistent and sustainable returns through the cycle. We believe executing on this commitment should result in a premium valuation that is in line with our peers who produce financial results similar to Delta. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Thank you."

For the December quarter, our pretax income increased 42% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. We expanded our operating margin more than 4.5 points to 17.1%. We are able to drive a significant improvement in our margins because we remained disciplined and strategic about our growth, which allowed us to capture more than 75% of the savings from lower fuel prices. For the quarter, we saw a 5-point improvement in domestic margins while international margins improved by 4 points. 
Thanks to our Delta employees for their contributions to another strong quarter, performance that drove a profit-sharing accrual of nearly $400 million bringing full year total to $1.5 billion. 2015 was another record year on all fronts, and we look forward to rewarding the Delta team for driving industry-leading operational and financial results on February 12. We have the best employees in the industry driving superior performance, which allows us to pay industry-leading total compensation.
Our revenues declined 2 points for the quarter versus the prior year driven by a $160 million headwind from foreign exchange, which means we were able to successfully push most of these fuel savings to the bottom line.
Corporate demand remained solid with volume growth of 3%. Domestic continued to be strong, particularly in the transcon and West Coast markets. Corporate travel buyers recently named Delta the leading airline for the fifth consecutive year, rating us #1 in the Business Travel News Annual Airline Survey. This is the first time BTN voters who manage tens of billions of dollars in annual travel spend have selected the same airline for 5 years in a row. 
We continue to invest in our ability to upsell in delta.com, which is driving our ancillary revenue growth. We have strong momentum with our plan to make our products available to all Delta customers with the recent introduction of Delta Comfort+ as a fare product and our first-mover branded fares launch with Expedia. Sales of Comfort+ increased nearly 60% to $125 million in the quarter and we see significant opportunity ahead now that we have started selling the product as a separate fare class. First-class upsell increased 20% driven by a 6-point payload factor improvement. Our agreement with American Express produced over $100 million in incremental value again this quarter and more than $400 million in incremental value for the year.
For the December quarter, our passenger unit revenues declined 1.6% as our winter capacity actions and holiday demand strength offset foreign currency and domestic yield headwinds. This result was better than our initial guide due to stronger demand than we had anticipated during the peak holiday season. Domestic unit revenues declined approximately 1 point as the yield environment remains competitive, similar to what we have been experiencing for most of the year. Overall, the domestic business is performing well. We remained focused on expanding service in higher-margin areas within our networks such as New York, Seattle and Los Angeles, which is also contributing to a RASM premium to our competitors. Atlanta also performed well with domestic RASM outpacing the system average despite competitive capacity growth in our largest hub.  
Our international business continues to face headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges, and we are seeing the benefits of the capacity reductions we have made in our performance. The trans-Atlantic entity saw unit revenues decline 4 points, entirely driven by FX and surcharges. The Paris attacks caused a 0.5-point reduction in our Atlantic RASM in the quarter, roughly $10 million impact. Core European market demand held up reasonably well in the quarter, and the capacity actions we had implemented in Africa, the Middle East and Russia helped results. Our joint ventures with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic continued to see margin expansion despite currency pressures and increased competitive capacity. 
In Latin America, our unit revenues were down 7 points due to currency, primarily in Brazil. Our capacity growth in the region was flat, and we are focusing growth on bright spots like Mexico and the Caribbean while reducing capacity in challenging markets like Brazil. During the quarter, we announced our intent to increase our stake in Aeromexico to up to 49%. We expect to close that transaction during the June quarter. This investment will bring the companies closer and allow us to participate in the financial improvements the Aeromexico team can deliver going forward in addition to the benefits we realize from our commercial partnership.
In the Pacific, unit revenues declined 3%, a solid improvement from where we were trending earlier in the year, helped by our significant network restructuring. Currency and fuel surcharges were a 13-point drag on unit revenue in the quarter. Pacific profitability improved again with margins up by 3 points this quarter.
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We will continue to leverage those opportunities with the greatest profit potential in our network while adjusting capacity in challenging regions. We currently expect capacity growth of 2% to 3% for the first quarter and 0 to 2% for the full year. Remember that our first quarter capacity includes 1 point of growth from leap day. We are planning for roughly 4% to 5% growth in the domestic region in the first quarter and 1% to 3% growth for the full year, in line with how we see demand and economic growth in the U.S. Domestic growth will come predominantly from higher gauge and targeting those markets where our past investments are allowing us to drive revenue and margin improvements.
Our margin-accretive upgauging actions will continue as we'll take out an additional 40- and 50-seaters in 2016 while adding seats to 23% of our narrow-body fleet. International capacity will decline 2% to 3% this quarter as the large reductions we've made during the fourth quarter in places like Japan, Brazil, Russia and the Middle East remain in place. For the year, we expect our international capacity to be flat to down 2 points.
Domestically, the demand environment remains solid although we continue to see yield pressure during the off-peak parts of the quarter, primarily in January and early February. This trend is consistent with what we have seen in the domestic entity over the last 6 months. 
Internationally, we expect the currency headwinds we've experienced in the December quarter to persist at similar levels in the March quarter, but begin to improve thereafter. In addition, we have seen further surcharge reductions through Q4 as fuel prices move lower.
Broader Europe continues to see an impact following the events in Paris in November and we had slowed our capacity growth into the region. We expect this will be roughly a 0.5-point headwind for system unit revenue for the quarter. 
In the Pacific, we expect to see good improvement in profitability again in 2016 as we reallocate additional capacity from Japan to growth markets, primarily China, an important pillar of our Pacific and overall company long-term strategy. We'll also benefit from downgauging efforts in the Pacific, and we'll retire the 9 remaining 747s in our fleet by the end of next year. 
We expect overall system unit revenues to decline 2.5% to 4.5% for the March quarter, which includes a 1.5-point headwind from currency. We expect the off-peak periods in January and February to be more challenging than March when we'll benefit from Easter and spring break.  We expect unit revenue trends to stabilize this summer. While lower fuel prices have resulted in RASM declines for longer than we initially expected, we are getting significantly larger cost savings from fuel there, driving strong margin and cash flow improvements. And as a result, we expect a record first quarter with an operating margin of 18% to 20%, a roughly 10-point improvement from the prior first quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Paul to go through details on costs and cash flow."
266311,321967369,919297,"Delta Air Lines, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Delta Air Lines, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everybody.

I'll start by highlighting another strong cost performance by the Delta team this quarter. Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to a roughly $570 million decline in total operating expenses despite nearly $120 million in higher profit share. Nonoperating expenses declined by $9 million even with the $75 million loss associated with the write-off of our remaining Venezuelan currency exposure, which was included in our results. Nonfuel CASM increased 1.9% on flat capacity including about a point of pressure from the pay raises we implemented in early December. That was offset by a little more than a point due to the currency benefits on the expense line.
As we have said previously, we have built a good foundation for cost productivity and we will continue to benefit from several of our ongoing initiatives including upgauging for several more years. Modifications on 20% of the fleet, as Ed mentioned, are in the early innings including on the 757s, the A320s, the A319s and the CRJ700s.
You should remember that in conjunction with the December 1 wage increase for most of our employees, we made a change to our profit-sharing plan, which affects our CASM due to the geography shift. Given the timing of those increases in 2015, our core cost growth will be more weighted towards the front half of 2016. We expect nonfuel CASM including profit sharing to increase roughly 5% for the first quarter, with approximately half of that growth driven by year-over-year profit share. 
For the fourth quarter, our total fuel expense declined by over $700 million, driven by lower mark to -- lower market fuel prices, which was net of $340 million in hedge losses including early settlements. Our all-in fuel price was $1.85 per gallon, down 30% from the prior year. 
The refinery contributed $8 million this quarter versus $105 million on the same period in 2014. The decline was primarily driven by considerably lower distillate cracks, which are of a substantial benefit to the airline, but a headwind for the refinery.
We currently expect our March quarter fuel expense to be $1.5 million lower year-over-year given the significantly lower hedge losses and the continued decline in market fuel prices. For the full year, we expect our fuel expense will be $3 billion lower than 2015, and we are forecasting an all-in first quarter fuel price of $1.20 to $1.25 based on last week's prices. 
As a result of the uncertainty in the markets, we have closed out our hedge book and have full participation to further downward movements in 2016.  For the full year, we expect our hedge losses to be in the $100 million to $200 million range per quarter -- throughout the year.
Moving on to cash flow. We're using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the investments we're making in the business for the long term while also derisking the balance sheet. Also, we are increasing our returns to our shareholders. This quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, just over $1 billion of which we reinvested into the business including 6 slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport as well as aircraft acquisitions and continued fleet modifications. 
For the first quarter, we expect capital spending to again be roughly $1 billion. For the full year, we expect our core CapEx to be approximately $3 billion with over -- a little bit higher in the first half of the year primarily due to the timing of aircraft spend. 
During the quarter, we returned $530 million to shareholders and expect to return a similar level of cash to our owners during the first quarter. For 2015 full year, we returned $2.6 billion, which equates to approximately 7% of our market cap. $360 million was paid in the form of dividends with the remaining $2.2 billion returned through repurchases. Specifically, we bought back a total of 48 million shares of our stock at an average price of $45.50.
Adjusted net debt at the end of December was $6.7 billion. Debt reduction was the biggest driver of $35 million in lower interest expense for the quarter relative to last year and $170 million below 2014 levels for the full year. Additionally, our pension liability declined by $1.3 billion as a result of a 50% -- 50 basis point increase in the discount rate. We remain committed to behaving as a high-value, cash return-focused, investment-grade company going forward and we're optimistic that an investment-grade rating is in sight this year. 
In closing, I'd like to echo Richard and Ed's comments and thank the entire Delta team for another record 2015. These results don't come easy. They come through hard work and we look forward to celebrating with them next month. Thank you.

And the reason why is that is really the optimal number that we can execute on any given 12-month period and a have high confidence of delivering the benefits on the time line we lay out.

We do believe that we're going to have substantially better operating cash flows because low fuel prices is very good for our business overall. We have a bias toward applying that to share buyback. So I think it's reasonable to expect, just as we said in our prepared remarks, that in 2015, we hit nearly 70% of returning our cash to our owners. And I would expect that -- we would expect that given the performance that we're on pace to achieve, that our share buyback number will be materially higher in 2016 than it was 2015. Now also understand that we're going to close the Aeromexico transaction, expected to close in the first half of the year, which will drive about $800 million of cash.

Our revenues were down about 2 points, but that was almost entirely due to the FX impacts on international. So by definition, we drove all the recovery of savings to fuel to the bottom line or certainly the vast majority of it. As fuel continues to decline, that continues to put some incremental pressure on it. But the pricing environment, where we stand today, is allowing us to do that because we're taking some pretty aggressive network actions to accommodate. So maybe one other way to think about this is if you look at full year 2015 results and we expect to be able to repeat this, at least this performance in 2016, in 2015, our operating revenues were up 1% so top line was up 1%, our fuel expenses were down 20% and our EPS was up 38%.

In terms of early summer, it's a little early to call that, but we see demand as very strong and I think one of the issues that we've talked to our investors about it is dividend or the American consumer has gotten from lower fuel, whether or not it's heating their home or whether or not it's filling up their car with gas and where they're reinvesting that and they seem to be willing to reinvest that into airline purchases, but at slightly lower fares and those lower fares are being generated by lower price of fuel. But core demand strength seems very strong in terms of corporate. And core demand strength in terms of leisure seems strong as well as far as we can see in the next 30, 60, 90 days."

Our corporate demand in the fourth quarter was up 3% across-the-board. Obviously, internationally was down a bit in Europe given some of the effects of the Paris attacks. But broadly speaking, our corporates continue to tell us that they expect growth in 2016 over 2015 levels. So I think this really gets down to a question of the volumes are there. We flew the Christmas season and the Thanksgiving season with some of the strongest load factors in our history. And people translate that into what it means when revenue -- there's certainly pricing pressure out there from the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago, but our yield's run average were down about 4% in the quarter. So most of that fall in the bottom line and our business looks pretty healthy."

One is continuing upgauge of the airline, which we have a lot of great and I think innovative programs in place, whether or not it's the densification that Paul talked about or whether it's the continued retiring of the 50-seat airplanes and upgauging the airline or to be a main line airline. So we have that as a couple of points. And actually, the fleet count remains flat. So when you're asked about the commitment, and really Jamie asked before what the lower boundary was, and we have plenty of space in the lower boundary, what we really plan for the upper boundary in terms of how many airplanes do we have coming in and how many pilots have we hired and that's really what determines and that's why we can say with confidence 0 to 2% because that's really running our factory as sufficiently as we could. We can always step back for now if the economic conditions change. But the investments this year are really in filling out the things we started before, continuing to get Kennedy to its full 250 departures a day. We think at 250 departures a day, since connectivity is exponential, that we will really see some aggressive improvements in returns in Kennedy as well as Seattle, which more and more is relying not only on the Seattle local traffic, but on the connectivity that we're generating through Seattle at this point from the entire Pacific Northwest. So really, those are our 2 key linchpins along with upgauging and making our existing hubs more efficient."

Good morning, everyone. This morning, Delta reported a $1.45 billion pretax profit and delivered earnings per share of $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result marks a 42% improvement year-on-year and was in line with consensus expectations. For the full year, we generated a $5.9 billion pretax profit, an increase of 29% over 2014. We grew our top line by 1% and realized substantial fuel savings, which allowed us to expand operating margins by over 3 points to 16.2%. Our return on invested capital was 28.3% for 2015. We generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $2.6 billion of that back to our owners this year. 
Our 2015 financial performance ranks Delta among the top 10% of S&P industrials. We are poised to continue outperforming as low fuel prices will allow us to produce further earnings and margin expansion in 2016 in the face of a strong dollar and some global economic uncertainty.
I want to thank the entire Delta team for all their hard work that contributed to another record year in 2015. For their efforts, we accrued $1.5 billion in profit-sharing for the full year 2015. We are looking forward to our largest profit-sharing payout in our history on Valentine's Day 2016. Our people are the primary reason Delta is the top-performing airline in the world and we are thankful for their commitment to our company. 
Our foundation at Delta is quite strong. Similar to other high-quality industrial companies, our focus is to drive value for our owners through top line growth, margin expansion, double-digit EPS growth and prudent deployment of our strong cash generation. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we have built a durable business model that can deliver strong results throughout the economic cycle. 
We continue to run the best operations by a wide margin of all the airlines in the world with a full year completion factor of 99.6% and an on-time rate of 85.9%. We had 161 100% mainline completion factor days in 2015, which significantly outpaces American, United and Southwest even if you combine their operations for the last several years. That operational excellence, along with the investments we've made in products and services, drove increases in our customer satisfaction with year-to-date domestic Net Promoter Score increasing more than 4 points to 38% compared to 2014.
The 4Q results show again that high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry. We are consistently generating 108% of industry average revenues across our system and north of 114% in the domestic entity. Through our capacity actions and commercial initiatives, we offset nearly $700 million of currency pressure this year and held our top line revenues intact year-on-year. This performance allowed us to capture more than 75% of the fuel savings in 2015, which drove strong margin improvements. 
We expect to improve upon this great performance in 2016. The scale and scope of our network allow us to focus on regions of strength, adjust capacity in regions that are economically challenged and move our capital assets to markets with strong returns. As we continue to globalize our network through our uniquely Delta joint ventures and equity investments, we will further enhance the flexibility and durability of our business, which will allow us to continue to drive strong revenue margin and cash flow growth for our owners over the long term.
Our focus on our long-term goals is unwavering. We will continue to reinvest in the business at an appropriate level to sustain long-term growth. That disciplined reinvestment has delivered high levels of returns to our owners. The substantial free cash flow we are generating allows us to continue to derisk the balance sheet. Our adjusted net debt declined $600 million to $6.7 billion in 2015, which is more than $10 billion lower than when we started almost a decade ago, and we think an investment-grade rating will occur in 2016.
At the same time, we are accelerating capital returns to our shareholders and repurchased 7% of our market cap in 2015. Including the dividend, this is the equivalent of 70% of our free cash flow going back to our owners, well above our 50% long-term target. 
We remain strongly committed to exceeding our long-term commitments to our owners. You'll recall from our Investor Day our long-term goal is to sustain operating margins of 14% to 16%, to have EPS growth year-on-year at 15%, to maintain a return on invested capital of 20% to 25%, to generate at least $7 billion to $8 billion of operating cash flow and at least $4 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow and to reach $4 billion in adjusted net debt by 2020. We expect to significantly exceed these goals in 2016. We have a significant opportunity in 2016 as the decline in fuel prices will provide us with a $3 billion tailwind in 2016 at current levels. Low fuel prices do put some pressure on our unit revenues, which we saw throughout 2015.
It is important for us to produce unit revenue improvements and we are committed to doing so in 2016. However, our capacity discipline and service excellence are contributing to unit revenue outperformance for Delta relative to the industry. We expect to grow capacity between 0% and 2% in 2016, an appropriate level of growth to balance capital investment with supply and demand and ensure the momentum in our business continues. 
Strong nonfuel cost discipline is critical to our long-term success. In 2015, we kept our nonfuel costs flat. Since the merger, we have grown nonfuel costs at a rate of less than 2% on an annual basis while investing significantly in our people, customers, operation, fleet and product. 
We are on track to meet or exceed the targets we laid out for you last May at our Investor Day of growing annual EPS greater than 15% and achieving returns on capital in excess of 20% and generating free cash flow in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion in 2016. We have consistently achieved our long-term goals. We will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices. 
Our first quarter 2016 performance will break all records as we expect an operating margin of 18% to 20% in what is seasonally Delta's lower-margin quarter. As we lay out the framework for 2016 and beyond, we see big opportunities ahead for our business. The key message of our Investor Day last month was that we are a high-quality industrial company built to deliver consistent and sustainable returns through the cycle. We believe executing on this commitment should result in a premium valuation that is in line with our peers who produce financial results similar to Delta. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Thank you."

For the December quarter, our pretax income increased 42% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. We expanded our operating margin more than 4.5 points to 17.1%. We are able to drive a significant improvement in our margins because we remained disciplined and strategic about our growth, which allowed us to capture more than 75% of the savings from lower fuel prices. For the quarter, we saw a 5-point improvement in domestic margins while international margins improved by 4 points. 
Thanks to our Delta employees for their contributions to another strong quarter, performance that drove a profit-sharing accrual of nearly $400 million bringing full year total to $1.5 billion. 2015 was another record year on all fronts, and we look forward to rewarding the Delta team for driving industry-leading operational and financial results on February 12. We have the best employees in the industry driving superior performance, which allows us to pay industry-leading total compensation.
Our revenues declined 2 points for the quarter versus the prior year driven by a $160 million headwind from foreign exchange, which means we were able to successfully push most of these fuel savings to the bottom line.
Corporate demand remained solid with volume growth of 3%. Domestic continues to be strong, particularly in the transcon and West Coast markets. Corporate travel buyers recently named Delta the leading airline for the fifth consecutive year, rating us #1 in the Business Travel News Annual Airline Survey. This is the first time BTN voters who manage tens of billions of dollars in annual travel spend have selected the same airline for 5 years in a row. 
We continue to invest in our ability to upsell in delta.com, which is driving our ancillary revenue growth. We have strong momentum with our plan to make our products available to all Delta customers with the recent introduction of Delta Comfort+ as a fare product and our first-mover branded fares launch with Expedia. Sales of Comfort+ increased nearly 60% to $125 million in the quarter and we see significant opportunity ahead now that we have started selling the product as a separate fare class. First-class upsell increased 20% driven by a 6-point payload factor improvement. Our agreement with American Express produced over $100 million in incremental value again this quarter and more than $400 million in incremental value for the year.
For the December quarter, our passenger unit revenues declined 1.6% as our winter capacity actions and holiday demand strength offset foreign currency and domestic yield headwinds. This result was better than our initial guide due to stronger demand than we had anticipated during the peak holiday season. Domestic unit revenues declined approximately 1 point as the yield environment remains competitive, similar to what we have been experiencing for most of the year. Overall, the domestic business is performing well. We remained focused on expanding service in higher-margin areas within our networks such as New York, Seattle and Los Angeles, which is also contributing to a RASM premium to our competitors. Atlanta also performed well with domestic RASM outpacing the system average despite competitive capacity growth in our largest hub.  
Our international business continues to face headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges, and we are seeing the benefits of the capacity reductions we have made in our performance. The trans-Atlantic entity saw unit revenues decline 4 points, entirely driven by FX and surcharges. The Paris attacks caused a 0.5-point reduction in our Atlantic RASM in the quarter, roughly $10 million impact. Core European market demand held up reasonably well in the quarter, and the capacity actions we had implemented in Africa, the Middle East and Russia helped results. Our joint ventures with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic continue to see margin expansion despite currency pressures and increased competitive capacity. 
In Latin America, our unit revenues were down 7 points due to currency, primarily in Brazil. Our capacity growth in the region was flat, and we are focusing growth on bright spots like Mexico and the Caribbean while reducing capacity in challenging markets like Brazil. During the quarter, we announced our intent to increase our stake in Aeromexico to up to 49%. We expect to close that transaction during the June quarter. This investment will bring the companies closer and allow us to participate in the financial improvements the Aeromexico team can deliver going forward in addition to the benefits we realize from our commercial partnership.
In the Pacific, unit revenues declined 3%, a solid improvement from where we were trending earlier in the year, helped by our significant network restructuring. Currency and fuel surcharges were a 13-point drag on unit revenue in the quarter. Pacific profitability improved again with margins up by 3 points this quarter.
Now turning to the first quarter of 2016. We will continue to leverage those opportunities with the greatest profit potential in our network while adjusting capacity in challenging regions. We currently expect capacity growth of 2% to 3% for the first quarter and 0% to 2% for the full year. Remember that our first quarter capacity includes 1 point of growth from leap day. We are planning for roughly 4% to 5% growth in the domestic region in the first quarter and 1% to 3% growth for the full year, in line with how we see demand and economic growth in the U.S. Domestic growth will come predominantly from higher gauge and targeting those markets where our past investments are allowing us to drive revenue and margin improvements.
Our margin-accretive upgauging actions will continue as we'll take out an additional 40 50-seaters in 2016 while adding seats to 23% of our narrow-body fleet. International capacity will decline 2% to 3% this quarter as the large reductions we've made during the fourth quarter in places like Japan, Brazil, Russia and the Middle East remain in place. For the year, we expect our international capacity to be flat to down 2 points.
Domestically, the demand environment remains solid although we continue to see yield pressure during the off-peak parts of the quarter, primarily in January and early February. This trend is consistent with what we have seen in the domestic entity over the last 6 months. 
Internationally, we expect the currency headwinds we've experienced in the December quarter to persist at similar levels in the March quarter, but begin to improve thereafter. In addition, we have seen further surcharge reductions through Q4 as fuel prices move lower.
Broader Europe continues to see an impact following the events in Paris in November and we have slowed our capacity growth into the region. We expect this will be roughly a 0.5-point headwind for system unit revenue for the quarter. 
In the Pacific, we expect to see good improvement in profitability again in 2016 as we reallocate additional capacity from Japan to growth markets, primarily China, an important pillar of our Pacific and overall company long-term strategy. We'll also benefit from downgauging efforts in the Pacific, and we'll retire the 9 remaining 747s in our fleet by the end of next year. 
We expect overall system unit revenues to decline 2.5% to 4.5% for the March quarter, which includes a 1.5-point headwind from currency. We expect the off-peak periods in January and February to be more challenging than March when we'll benefit from Easter and spring break.  We expect unit revenue trends to stabilize this summer. While lower fuel prices have resulted in RASM declines for longer than we initially expected, we are getting significantly larger cost savings from fuel there, driving strong margin and cash flow improvements. And as a result, we expect a record first quarter with an operating margin of 18% to 20%, a roughly 10-point improvement from the prior first quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Paul to go through details on costs and cash flow."

I'll start by highlighting another strong cost performance by the Delta team this quarter. Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to a roughly $570 million decline in total operating expenses despite nearly $120 million in higher profit share. Nonoperating expenses declined by $9 million even with the $75 million loss associated with the write-off of our remaining Venezuelan currency exposure, which was included in our results. Nonfuel CASM increased 1.9% on flat capacity including about a point of pressure from the pay raises we implemented in early December. That was offset by a little more than a point due to the currency benefits on the expense line.
As we have said previously, we have built a good foundation for cost productivity and we will continue to benefit from several of our ongoing initiatives including upgauging for several more years. Modifications on 20% of the fleet, as Ed mentioned, are in the early innings including on the 757s, the A320s, the A319s and the CRJ700s.
You should remember that in conjunction with the December 1 wage increase for most of our employees, we made a change to our profit-sharing plan, which affects our CASM due to the geography shift. Given the timing of those increases in 2015, our core cost growth will be more weighted towards the front half of 2016. We expect nonfuel CASM including profit sharing to increase roughly 5% for the first quarter, with approximately half of that growth driven by year-over-year profit share. 
For the fourth quarter, our total fuel expense declined by over $700 million, driven by lower mark to -- lower market fuel prices, which was net of $340 million in hedge losses including early settlements. Our all-in fuel price was $1.85 per gallon, down 30% from the prior year. 
The refinery contributed $8 million this quarter versus $105 million on the same period in 2014. The decline was primarily driven by considerably lower distillate cracks, which are of a substantial benefit to the airline, but a headwind for the refinery.
We currently expect our March quarter fuel expense to be $1.5 million lower year-over-year given the significantly lower hedge losses and the continued decline in market fuel prices. For the full year, we expect our fuel expense will be $3 billion lower than 2015, and we are forecasting an all-in first quarter fuel price of $1.20 to $1.25 based on last week's prices. 
As a result of the uncertainty in the markets, we have closed out our hedge book and have full participation to further downward movements in 2016.  For the full year, we expect our hedge losses to be in the $100 million to $200 million range per quarter -- throughout the year.
Moving on to cash flow. We're using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the investments we're making in the business for the long term while also derisking the balance sheet. Also, we are increasing our returns to our shareholders. This quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, just over $1 billion of which we reinvested into the business including 6 slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport as well as aircraft acquisitions and continued fleet modifications. 
For the first quarter, we expect capital spending to again be roughly $1 billion. For the full year, we expect our core CapEx to be approximately $3 billion with over -- a little bit higher in the first half of the year primarily due to the timing of aircraft spend. 
During the quarter, we returned $530 million to shareholders and expect to return a similar level of cash to our owners during the first quarter. For 2015 full year, we returned $2.6 billion, which equates to approximately 7% of our market cap. $360 million was paid in the form of dividends with the remaining $2.2 billion returned through repurchases. Specifically, we bought back a total of 48 million shares of our stock at an average price of $45.50.
Adjusted net debt at the end of December was $6.7 billion. Debt reduction was the biggest driver of $35 million in lower interest expense for the quarter relative to last year and $170 million below 2014 levels for the full year. Additionally, our pension liability declined by $1.3 billion as a result of a 50% -- 50 basis point increase in the discount rate. We remain committed to behaving as a high-value, cash return-focused, investment-grade company going forward and we're optimistic that an investment-grade rating is in sight this year. 
In closing, I'd like to echo Richard and Ed's comments and thank the entire Delta team for another record 2015. These results don't come easy. They come through hard work and we look forward to celebrating with them next month. Thank you.

We have a bias to holding our core CapEx at around the $3 billion number. And the reason why is that is really the optimum number that we can execute on any given 12-month period and have a high confidence of delivering the benefits on the time line we lay out. So that really is the linchpin to our capital allocation strategy. We do believe that we're going to have substantially better operating cash flows because low fuel prices is very good for our business overall. We have a bias toward applying that to share buyback. So I think it's reasonable to expect, just as we said in our prepared remarks, that in 2015, we hit nearly 70% of returning our cash to our owners. And I would expect that -- we would expect that given the performance that we're on pace to achieve, that our share buyback number will be materially higher in 2016 than it was 2015. Now also understand that we're going to close the Aeromexico transaction, expected to close in the first half of the year, which will drive about $800 million of cash. But that will have a quick and immediate return just as our investment in Virgin did. So core CapEx at $3 billion, we have the Aeromexico investment coming.

Our revenues were down about 2 points, but that was almost entirely due to the FX impacts on international. So by definition, we drove all the recovery of savings to fuel to the bottom line or certainly the vast majority of it. As fuel continues to decline, that continues to put some incremental pressure on it. But the pricing environment, where we stand today, is allowing us to do that because we're taking some pretty aggressive network actions to accommodate. So maybe one other way to think about this is if you look at full year 2015 results and we expect to be able to repeat this, at least this performance in 2016, in 2015, our operating revenues were up 1% so top line was up 1%, our fuel expenses were down 20% and our EPS was up 38%. We took a lot of that to the bottom line. That -- I mean, it's pretty remarkable that our top line went up 1% in 2015 and we were able to take 20%, which was 2.2 -- and this was after fuel hedge losses, we took 2.286 lower fuel and produced a 38% improvement in EPS."

But broadly speaking, our corporates continue to tell us that they expect growth in 2016 over 2015 levels. So I think this really gets down to a question of the volumes are there. We flew the Christmas season and the Thanksgiving season with some of the strongest load factors in our history. And people translate that into what it means when revenue -- there's certainly pricing pressure out there from the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago, but our yield's run average were down about 4% in the quarter.

So when you're asked about the commitment, and really Jamie asked before what the lower boundary was, and we have plenty of space in the lower boundary, what we really plan for is the upper boundary in terms of how many airplanes do we have coming in and how many pilots have we hired and that's really what determines and that's why we can say with confidence 0% to 2% because that's really running our factory as sufficiently as we could. We can always step back for now if the economic conditions change. But the investments this year are really in filling out the things we started before, continuing to get Kennedy to its full 250 departures a day. We think at 250 departures a day, since connectivity is exponential, that we will really see some aggressive improvements in returns in Kennedy as well as Seattle, which more and more is relying not only on the Seattle local traffic, but on the connectivity that we're generating through Seattle at this point from the entire Pacific Northwest.

This morning, we reported a $1.56 billion pretax profit, our 12th consecutive record quarter results as the business continues to benefit from low fuel prices and solid demand. We held our top line roughly flat and realized substantial fuel savings, which allowed us to expand operating margins by nearly 10 points to 18.5% and generate $1.4 billion in operating cash flows. These are nothing short of outstanding results in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year where we also saw additional pressure from the tragic events that occurred in Brussels in late March. 
Operationally, we again led the global industry with a 99.4% completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 86.5%. We had 49 perfect mainline completion days and 6 additional days where the only canceled flights in our network were in Brussels. It's now more rare to have a day with a cancellation than not on our mainline product. 
We also had 8 days of no cancellations across the entire Delta system, both mainline and regional carriers, what we called brand perfect days and we are focusing more and more on the system level performance and working hard to improve on this basis. 
With these results, the Delta team proved yet again they are the very best in the industry. I'm proud to announce we accrued $272 million of profit-sharing this quarter on top of the $23 million in Shared Rewards they earned. 
I want to thank the Delta team for a terrific quarter. It's an honor to be able you to disagree company and serve all of you. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank Richard for his leadership and vision in transforming Delta. Richard has been a great partner and mentor for me for the past decade and while he'll be enjoying a well-earned retirement, he will always be a trusted friend and adviser and we also benefit from his leadership as of the Executive Chairman of our board. 
Our strategy is working and our team is fully in place. We've got Gayle West, our Chief Operating Officer, who leads the best team of operators in the industry. Glen Hauenstein, our new President, has led our network in revenue transformation over the last decade. Steve Sear [ph] has taken us to 5 consecutive Business Travel News victories as head of our sales organization. Paul, Joanne, Peter, Kevin, the list goes on. Our bench is deep and we're going to keep building on our momentum. 
While we continue to post record profits, we are aware that fuel prices remain volatile and have increased nearly 60% from the lows earlier this year. For this reason, we are determined to get our business back on the path to positive unit revenues because this is how we ensure that the margins and cash flows that we are producing are sustainable through good times and bad. Glen will be describing our actions along this course. 
As we look ahead at Delta, we have tremendous momentum in the business. While lower for longer fuel prices have added some painful uncertainty to our time line, I'm getting back to unit revenue growth. They are also driving roughly $3 billion of fuel savings this year and we are committed to pushing as much of that fuel savings to the bottom line as possible. 
We estimate that we retained 50% of fuel savings in the first quarter on an ex-hedged basis. On a net hedged basis, our fuel savings retention was 75%. 
We're using the cash flow generated by these record earnings to invest in long-term profitable growth opportunities for the business, improving the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding the pension and continuing to return cash to owners. As we've done for the past several years, we plan to update you on our long-term plan and capital deployment strategy at our upcoming spring Analyst Meeting, which will be held this year on May 16. 
I've you been asked many times over the last couple of months as I take over as CEO as to what my priorities ability as we look to the future. Our goal as a team will be to continue to invest in the initiatives that are producing a durable, sustainable and industry-leading foundation at Delta. 
First, our top priority is running a safe, reliable and customer focus operation. This is at the very core of what we do. It is producing meaningful improvement and customer satisfaction. It also translates into our industry-leading RASM premium and a more efficient cost structure, both of which contribute to more sustainable margins over the long term. 
Second is enhancing our brand premium. We said before that our product is not a commodity. In order to earn a premium price from customers, we need to produce a premium product and a brand that drives loyalty, that starts with thoughtful service and reliable operations, but also includes consistent innovation across the entire travel experience. 
Third, you'll see us continue on the path towards globalization. Whether through initiatives like headquartering our trans-Atlantic operations in Amsterdam or through our equity stakes in Virgin Atlanta, Atlanta, China Eastern, Aeromexico and GOL, we see the international marketplace as the source of long-term profitable growth opportunities. Our goal is to be the best U.S. global airline. 
And finally, we'll maintain the balanced approach for all our stakeholders, our employees, our owners and the customers and communities we serve share in Delta's success. This strategy has driven tremendous value for all our stakeholders and is the foundation for sustainable performance over the long term. 
I'm excited about the future of Delta Air Lines and honored to lead the very beast best team of airlines professionals in the world. I thank our investors for the trust they place in us and assure you we are working hard be great stewards of your investment. 
With that, I'll happy to turn happy turn the call over to my good friend, Glen Hauenstein."

Taking great care of our customers everyday has resulted in another record quarterly performance. I am honored and humbled to be taking on the role of President at this very exciting time for our company. There are enormous opportunities ahead for our business and I look forward to driving our continued success together. 
Our revenues for the quarter were roughly flat to last year, including $125 million headwind from currency and $5 million impact from the recent events in Brussels. We also maintained our top line performance despite a 40% decline in market fuel prices. 
Our corporate demand remained solid with volume growth of 2% this quarter. So our increases across most sectors, including health care, financial services and technology. However, the improvement in volumes is being more than offset by lower yields. 
The outlook for corporate demand remains favorable with 82% of respondents to our latest travel managers survey protecting their overall travel spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of the year. This is consistent with outlooks from previous surveys. 
We continue to see good performance with our branded fare initiatives. Total merchandising revenues grew over 30% for the quarter, led by Comfort+ growth of 45% and First Class revenue growth of 12%. 
Basic Economy drove roughly $20 million in incremental revenue and we began our broad city level expansion initiative during the quarter. 
Our partnership with American Express produced $80 million in incremental value this quarter and we expect $265 million in incremental value for the year. 
Year-to-date, new card acquisitions are at record levels and up substantially from 2015. Spend on our cards is up double digits. We continue to work with our great partners at AmEx to produce innovative program offerings for our customers and continue to grow our portfolio. 
Our passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with roughly 2 points of the decline attributable to currency. This result was at the low end of our initial guidance as we continue to see choppiness in the domestic close and yield environment during the quarter.
Focusing on our domestic business, unit revenues declined 5% on 6% more capacity, 1 point of that growth attributable to leap day. 
All of our domestic improved margins in the quarter with the best performances in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Minneapolis. 
Our investments in markets like New York and Seattle are continuing to pay off as we drove margin expansion in excess of the domestic air rage in both of these cities. 
Our international business is still facing headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges, as well as economic and geopolitical challenges in certain regions, all of which we continue to address with capacity actions.
The trans-Atlantic entity saw unit revenue decline of 6% on a 3.5% reduction in capacity, driven by a 4 point headwind from currency and pressure on yields as industry capacity grew into high single digits during the normally slow season. 
In our core European markets, U.S. point of sales demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels. On the flip side, European point-of-sale demand has been softer largely due to the weaker euro. 
We are pleased with our performance in London and we continue to benefit from a deeper integration with Virgin Atlantic and the network changes we made together in 2015. 
Paris unit revenues improved year-over-year as travel to the region rebounded following the events of last November.
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 9% with 5% of the decline attributable to currency, largely driven by the Brazilian real. 
Mexico and Caribbean markets performed well during the quarter and have remained resilient throughout the peak spring travel period. [indiscernible] related cancellations had a very small impact on Latin America. 
Our Brazil capacity has been reduced by nearly 30% from peak levels, while our modest capacity growth has been well observed in Mexico and the Caribbean. 
In the Pacific, PRASM declines are moderating with unit revenues down 5%, including roughly 8 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges. 
The yen was a $35 million headwind in the quarter, $30 million of which was driven by lower year-on-year hedge gains. While the recent appreciation of the yen is a positive for our business. We will see roughly a 4 point headwind to trans-Pacific RASM from lower hedge gains through the remainder of the year. 
Capacity to the Pacific declined 9% this quarter, primarily driven by Japan. This is part of our continuing Pacific restructuring, which includes the ongoing retirement of our 747 fleet. 
Our China business continues to mature as our partnerships with China Eastern and China Southern. Today, between 15% and 20% of our customers are traveling beyond Shanghai and Beijing to our partners' networks. We expect that number to steadily increase over time. 
Demand in China and the broader Pacific held up well for the first quarter, although yields remained under pressure due to higher level of industry capacity growth in the region. 
Looking ahead, we are forecasting that second quarter unit revenues will be down 2.5% to 4.5%, a sequential improvement from our first quarter revenue results, on a 2% year-on-year capacity increase.
While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive RASMs. Volatility and yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected, but we continue to target to reaching the inflection point this year. We have a good line of sight in domestic, encouraged by the recent yielded trends, which are now beginning to turn positive after being down for roughly a year.
In addition to our domestic capacity -- in addition, our domestic capacity growth moderates with each successive quarter during the year. 
In LatAm and the Pacific actions and restructuring efforts will continue to benefit us, while currency headwinds are also easing. We continue to expect unit revenues to inflect in both entities in the summer time frame. 
In the trans-Atlantic, which accounts for 15% to 20% of our revenues is where we have the greatest challenge. Yields remain under pressure as industry capacity growth continues to add strip demand. 
Peak season volumes from U.S. to Europe remained very strong and will drive record profits this summer given the lower fuel prices. And when positive is that we will get a big help from currency trends from the headwind into a tailwind beginning in the next quarter. 
In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are focused on taking the necessary actions to get positive RASM in 2016 and ahead of our network competitors. If for no other reason than to get off my back. We will have a line of sight to achieving our goal in domestic, the Pacific and Latin America, we are addressing the headwinds we face in Europe and we will add quickly to move all the levers in our business, including capacity, if we do not see sufficient progress in the coming months. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won't stay low permanently. As a result",801,"Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won't stay low permanently. As a result, we remain focused on staying disciplined with our costs. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter however were down more than $1 billion as this decline in fuel cost offset wage increases as well as higher profit-sharing expense, which doubled versus last year this quarter. 
Nonfuel CASM increased 4.5%, including profit sharing, better than our initial expectation with roughly half of that increase coming from higher profit-sharing in the quarter. 
As you may recall, our cost growth is more weighted toward the front half of the year given the timing of last year's wage increases and this quarter is the peak. 
During the quarter, we retired 10 older mainline aircraft, including 9, 757s and 1, 767300. We removed 6, 50-seaters from our schedule also during the quarter. We continue to expect our re-fleeting efforts to drive another $350 million of savings in 2016. 
Our maintenance initiatives benefited us by $90 million in the quarter and we continue to target a $400 million benefit for the whole -- for the full year. 
For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel CASM, including profit sharing to increase roughly 2% as our productivity and other cost initiatives help offset higher wages and product and services investments. CASM growth in the second quarter will be well below 1Q levels as we lap last year's April 1 wage increase. We remain on track to keep nonfuel cost ex profit-sharing below 2% for the full year.
Moving on to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $1.5 billion due to lower market fuel prices and lower year-over-year hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down 55% from the prior year. 
The refinery lost a modest $28 million in the quarter. While lower crack spreads are a headwind for the refinery, they are obviously a significant net benefit for Delta as a whole. 
Looking ahead, we expect an all-in June quarter fuel price of $1.48 to $1.53, which is down 40% from prior year. We continue to have no open hedges going forward and anticipate hedge losses of approximately $200 million in each of the remaining quarters this year. 
With the combination of the fuel tailwind, our nonfuel cost discipline and the sequential improvement in RASM performance Glen discussed, we expect another record quarter in June with an operating margin of 21% to 23%, a roughly 5-point improvement from the prior year.
On cash flow, we are using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the long-term investments we are making in the business, while continuing to return cash to our owners and derisking the balance sheet. 
As Ed mentioned, we generated $1.35 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. This was net of $1.5 billion in profit-sharing payouts to employees for 2015 and an $825 million cash contribution to the pension plan. We also contributed $350 million in Delta stock during -- to the pension during the quarter. 
With the additional $100 million in cash we put in the plans this month, we have contributed $1.3 billion in cash and stock since the beginning of the year. This completes our funding for 2016. 
We reinvested $870 million back into the business during the quarter. As you may recall, we expect higher capital spending in the first half of the year due to the timing of aircraft spend and we'll spend roughly $1 billion again in the second quarter. Additionally, this year, we expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the third quarter. 
In the March quarter, we returned $880 million to shareholders, including the $350 million accelerated share repurchase we completed to offset the dilution from the contribution to the pension plan. 
Adjusted net debt at the end of the March was $7 billion, up slightly from year end due to the timing of cash flows, including pension funding and profit sharing and the decision we made to stay on track for a run rate for buybacks during the quarter. We expect our adjusted net debt to be below $6 billion by year-end with our cash flow. 
We've made significant progress on delevering our business over the last decade and we are pleased to have this recognized with an upgrade by Moody's to investment-grade during the quarter. 
In closing, I'd like to thank and congratulate the entire Delta team not only for another record quarter, but also for achieving our long-held goal of returning as an investment-grade company. These accomplishments would have not been possible without your determination, dedication and hard work each and every day. Jill, back to you."

I appreciate, and I'm sure most equity investors on this call probably appreciates your admirable goal of getting back to positive year-over-year unit revenue growth. I guess what I'm less certain of is whether just saying unit revenue is actually achievable over the next few years with returns running as high as there are across the industry, which, to me, would appear likely to drive continued that is mid-single digit supply growth, which is kind of what we've been seeing. So just wondering and maybe perhaps just focusing on the domestic markets assuming the current status quo of low single-digit GDP growth, fuel in kind of the low to mid-40s per barrel and then continued mid-single-digit domestic supplier across the industry, how do you really establish any confidence that you can get to sustain unit revenue growth and understandably, demand is going to kind of ebb and flow and maybe you can get there for a quarter or 2, but just any color on sort of how you can get there and sustain there given the return profile across the industry?"

It'll be about 2 years of contraction, which were caused really by the fuel price being cut in less than half. And I think if you look at the correlation to fuel and unit revenues, over time, you'll see a very tight correlation in the longer term. And so as you -- depending on where your fuel assumption is, if you see fuel bottoming at 27 in the December time period and then you see a gradual improvement, although longer -- lower for longer, I think that ultimately will be reflected in ticket prices, and that's one of the reasons I think we're relatively confident that we will get to our unit revenue in the back half of the year than we did in the first half of the year. And couple that with the foreign exchanges moving from a negative to a positive, I think that shows where we get to back to. Back to the domestic arena, I do think that most of this a decline is being caused by the decrease in fuel."

This morning, we reported a $1.56 billion pretax profit, our 12th consecutive record quarterly result, as the business continues to benefit from low fuel prices and solid demand. We held our top line roughly flat and realized substantial fuel savings, which allowed us to expand operating margins by nearly 10 points to 18.5% and generate $1.4 billion in operating cash flows. These are nothing short of outstanding results in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, where we also saw additional pressure from the tragic events that occurred in Brussels in late March.
Operationally, we again led the global industry with a 99.4% completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 86.5%. We had 49 perfect mainline completion days and 6 additional days where the only canceled flights in our network were to Brussels. It's now more rare to have a day with a cancellation than not on our mainline product.
We also had 8 days of no cancellations across the entire Delta system, both mainline and regional carriers, what we call brand perfect days, and we are focusing more and more on the system level performance and working hard to improve on this basis.
With these results, the Delta team proved yet again they are the very best in the industry. I'm proud to announce we accrued $272 million in profit-sharing this quarter on top of the $23 million in Shared Rewards they earned.
I want to thank the Delta team for a terrific quarter. It's an honor to be able to lead this great company and serve all of you.
I'd like to take a moment to thank Richard for his leadership and vision in transforming Delta. Richard has been a great partner and mentor for me for the past decade. And while he'll be enjoying a well-earned retirement, he will always be a trusted friend and adviser, and we all benefit from his leadership as the Executive Chairman of our board.
Our strategy is working, and our team is fully in place. We've got Gil West, our Chief Operating Officer, who leads the best team of operators in the industry. Glen Hauenstein, our new President, has led our network in revenue transformation over the last decade. Steve Sear has taken us to 5 consecutive Business Travel News victories as head of our sales organization. Paul, Joanne, Peter, Kevin, the list goes on. Our bench is deep, and we're going to keep building on our momentum.
While we continue to post record profits, we are very aware that fuel prices remain volatile and have increased nearly 60% from the lows earlier this year. For this reason, we are determined to get our business back on the path to positive unit revenues, because this is how we ensure that the margins and cash flows that we are producing are sustainable, through good times and bad. Glen will be describing our actions along this course.
As we look ahead at Delta, we have tremendous momentum in the business. While lower for longer fuel prices have added some painful uncertainty to our time line and getting back to unit revenue growth, they are also driving roughly $3 billion of fuel savings this year, and we are committed to pushing as much of that fuel savings to the bottom line as possible.
We estimate that we retained 50% of fuel savings in the first quarter on an ex-hedged basis. On a net-hedged basis, our fuel savings retention was 75%.
We're using the cash flow generated by these record earnings to invest in long-term profitable growth opportunities for the business, improving the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding the pension and continuing to return cash to owners. As we've done for the past several years, we plan to update you on our long-term plan and capital deployment strategy at our upcoming Spring Analyst Meeting, which will be held this year on May 16.
I've been asked many a times over the last couple of months, as I take over as CEO, as to what my priorities will be as we look to the future. Our goal as a team will be to continue to invest in the initiatives that are producing a durable, sustainable and industry-leading foundation at Delta.
First, our top priority is running a safe, reliable and customer-focused operation. This is at the very core of what we do. It is producing meaningful improvements and customer satisfaction. It also translates into our industry-leading RASM premium and a more efficient cost structure, both of which contribute to more sustainable margins over the long term.
Second is enhancing our brand premium. We said before that our product is not a commodity. In order to earn a premium price from customers, we need to produce a premium product and a brand that drives loyalty, that starts with thoughtful service and reliable operations, but also includes consistent innovation across the entire travel experience.
Third, you'll see us continue on the path towards globalization. Whether through initiatives like headquartering our trans-Atlantic operations in Amsterdam or through our equity stakes in Virgin Atlanta -- Atlantic, China Eastern, Aeromexico and GOL, we see the international marketplace as the source of long-term profitable growth opportunities. Our goal is to be the best U.S. global airline.
And finally, we'll maintain the balanced approach for all our stakeholders, our employees, our owners and the customers and communities we serve share in Delta's success. This strategy has driven tremendous value for all our stakeholders and is the foundation for sustainable performance over the long term.
I'm excited about the future of Delta Air Lines and honored to lead the very best team of airlines professionals in the world. I thank our investors for the trust they place in us, and assure you we are working hard be great stewards of your investment.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to my good friend, Glen Hauenstein."

I am honored and humbled to be taking on the role of President at this very exciting time for our company. There are enormous opportunities ahead for our business, and I look forward to driving our continued success together.
Our revenues for the quarter were roughly flat to last year, including $125 million headwind from currency and $5 million impact from the recent events in Brussels. We also maintained our top line performance despite a 40% decline in market fuel prices.
Our corporate demand remained solid with volume growth of 2% this quarter. We saw increases across most sectors, including health care, financial services and technology. However, the improvement in volumes is being more than offset by lower yields.
The outlook for corporate demand remains favorable with 82% of respondents to our latest corporate travel manager survey projecting their overall travel spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of the year.This is consistent with outlooks from previous surveys.
We continue to see good performance with our branded fare initiatives. Total merchandising revenues grew over 30% for the quarter, led by Comfort+ growth of 45% and First Class revenue growth of 12%.
Basic Economy drove roughly $20 million in incremental revenue, and we began our broad city level expansion initiative during the quarter.
Our partnership with American Express produced $80 million in incremental value this quarter, and we expect $265 million in incremental value for the year.
Year-to-date, new card acquisitions are at record levels and up substantially from 2015. Spend on our cards is up double digits. We continue to work with our great partners at AmEx to produce innovative program offerings for our customers and continue to grow our portfolio.
Our passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with roughly 2 points of the decline attributable to currency. This result was at the low end of our initial guidance as we continue to see choppiness in the domestic close and yield environment during the quarter.
Focusing on our domestic business, unit revenues declined 5% on 6% more capacity, 1 point of that growth attributable to leap day.
All of our domestic hubs improved margins in the quarter with the best performances in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Minneapolis.
Our investments in markets like New York and Seattle are continuing to pay off as we drove margin expansion in excess of the domestic average in both of these cities.
Our international business is still facing headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges as well as economic and geopolitical challenges in certain regions, all of which we continue to address with capacity actions.
The trans-Atlantic entity saw unit revenue decline of 6% on a 3.5% reduction in capacity, driven by a 4-point headwind from currency and pressure on yields, as industry capacity grew in the high single digits during the normally slow season.
In our core European markets, U.S. point of sales demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels. On the flip side, European point-of-sale demand has been softer, largely due to the weaker euro.
We are pleased with our performance in London, and we continue to benefit from a deeper integration with Virgin Atlantic and the network changes we made together in 2015.
Paris unit revenues improved year-over-year, as travel to the region rebounded following the events of last November.
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 9% with 5% of the decline attributable to currency, largely driven by the Brazilian Real.
Mexico and Caribbean markets performed well during the quarter and have remained resilient throughout the peak spring travel period. 
Zika-related cancellations had a very small impact on Latin America.
Our Brazil capacity has been reduced by nearly 30% from peak levels, while our modest capacity growth has been well observed in Mexico and the Caribbean. 
In the Pacific, PRASM declines are moderating with unit revenues down 5%, including roughly 8 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges.
The yen was a $35 million headwind in the quarter, $30 million of which was driven by lower year-on-year hedge gains. While the recent appreciation of the yen is a positive for our business, we will see roughly a 4-point headwind to trans-Pacific RASM from lower hedge gains through the remainder of the year.
Capacity to the Pacific declined 9% this quarter, primarily driven by Japan. This is part of our continuing Pacific restructuring, which includes the ongoing retirement of our 747 fleet.
Our China business continues to mature as do our partnerships with China Eastern and China Southern. Today, between 15% and 20% of our customers are traveling beyond Shanghai and Beijing to our partners' networks. We expect that number to steadily increase over time.
Demand in China and the broader Pacific held up well for the first quarter, although yields remained under pressure due to high levels of industry capacity growth in the region.
Looking ahead, we are forecasting that second quarter unit revenues will be down 2.5% to 4.5%, a sequential improvement from our first quarter revenue results, on a 2% year-on-year capacity increase.
While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive RASMs. Volatility in [indiscernible] yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected. But we continue to target reaching the inflection point this year. We have a good line of sight to getting there in domestic, we're encouraged by the recent yielded trends, which are now beginning to turn positive after being down for roughly a year.
In addition to our domestic capacity -- in addition, our domestic capacity growth moderates with each successive quarter during the year.
In LatAm and the Pacific, our capacity actions and restructuring efforts will continue to benefit us, while currency headwinds are also easing. We continue to expect unit revenues to inflect in both entities in the summer time frame.
In the trans-Atlantic, which accounts for 15% to 20% of our revenues is where we have the greatest challenge. Yields remain under pressure as industry capacity growth continues to add strip demand.
Peak season volumes from U.S. to Europe remain very strong and will drive record profits this summer given the lower fuel prices. And one positive is that we will get a big help from currency that turns from a headwind into a tailwind beginning in the next quarter.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are focused on taking the necessary actions to get to positive RASM in 2016 and ahead of our network competitors, if for no other reason than to get Ed off my back. We will have a line of sight to achieving our goal in domestic, the Pacific and Latin America, we are addressing the headwinds we face in Europe and we will add quickly to move all the levers in our business, including capacity, if we do not see sufficient progress in the coming months.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul."

While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment, and we know fuel won't stay low permanently. As a result, we remain focused on staying disciplined with our costs.
Total operating expenses for the quarter, however, were down more than $1 billion as this decline in fuel cost offset wage increases as well as higher profit-sharing expense, which doubled versus last year this quarter.
Nonfuel CASM increased 4.5%, including profit sharing, better than our initial expectation, with roughly half of that increase coming from higher profit-sharing in the quarter.
As you may recall, our cost growth is more weighted toward the front half of the year given the timing of last year's wage increases and this quarter is the peak.
During the quarter, we retired 10 older mainline aircraft, including 9, 757s and 1, 767-300. We removed 6, 50-seaters from our schedule also during the quarter. We continue to expect our re-fleeting efforts to drive another $350 million of savings in 2016.
Our maintenance initiatives benefited us by $90 million in the quarter, and we continue to target a $400 million benefit for the whole -- for the full year.
For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel CASM, including profit sharing to increase roughly 2% as our productivity and other cost initiatives help offset higher wages and product and services investments. CASM growth in the second quarter will be well below 1Q levels as we lap last year's April 1 wage increase. We remain on track to keep nonfuel cost ex profit-sharing below 2% for the full year.
Moving on to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $1.5 billion due to lower market fuel prices and lower year-over-year hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down 55% from the prior year.
The refinery lost a modest $28 million in the quarter. While lower crack spreads are a headwind for the refinery, they are obviously a significant net benefit for Delta as a whole.
Looking ahead, we expect an all-in June quarter fuel price of $1.48 to $1.53, which is down 40% from prior year. We continue to have no open hedges going forward and anticipate hedge losses of approximately $200 million in each of the remaining quarters this year.
With the combination of the fuel tailwind, our nonfuel cost discipline and the sequential improvement in RASM performance Glen discussed, we expect another record quarter in June with an operating margin of 21% to 23%, roughly 5-point improvement from the prior year.
On cash flow, we are using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the long-term investments we are making in the business, while continuing to return cash to our owners and derisking the balance sheet. 
As Ed mentioned, we generated $1.35 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. This was net of $1.5 billion in profit-sharing payouts to employees for 2015 and an $825 million cash contribution to the pension plan. We also contributed $350 million in Delta stock during -- to the pension during the quarter.
With the additional $100 million in cash we put in the plans this month, we have contributed $1.3 billion in cash and stock since the beginning of the year. This completes our funding for 2016.
We reinvested $870 million back into the business during the quarter. As you may recall, we expect higher capital spending in the first half of the year due to the timing of aircraft spend, and we'll spend roughly $1 billion again in the second quarter. Additionally, this year, we expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the third quarter.
In the March quarter, we returned $880 million to shareholders, including the $350 million accelerated share repurchase we completed to offset the dilution from the contribution to the pension plan.
Adjusted net debt at the end of March was $7 billion, up slightly from year-end due to the timing of cash flows, including pension funding and profit sharing, and the decision we made to stay on track for a run rate for buybacks during the quarter. We expect our adjusted net debt to be below $6 billion by year-end with our cash flow.
We've made significant progress on delevering our business over the last decade. And we are pleased to have this recognized with an upgrade by Moody's to investment grade during the quarter.
In closing, I'd like to thank and congratulate the entire Delta team not only for another record quarter, but also for achieving our long-held goal of returning as an investment-grade company. These accomplishments would not have been possible without your determination, dedication and hard work each and every day. Jill, back to you."

So just wondering and maybe perhaps just focusing on the domestic market, assuming the current status quo of low single-digit GDP growth, fuel in kind of the low to mid-40s per barrel and then continued mid-single-digit domestic supply growth across the industry, how do you really establish any confidence that you can get to sustain unit revenue growth and understandably, demand is going to kind of ebb and flow and maybe you can get there for a quarter or 2, but just any color on sort of how you can get there and sustain there given the return profile across the industry?"

There will be about 2 years of contraction, which were caused really by the fuel price being cut in less than half. And I think if you look at the correlation to fuel and unit revenues, over time, you'll see a very tight correlation in the longer term. And so as you -- depending on what your fuel assumption is, if you see fuel bottoming at 27 in the December time period and then you see a gradual improvement, although longer -- lower for longer, I think that ultimately will be reflected in ticket prices, and that's one of the reasons I think we're relatively confident that we will get to a -- our unit revenue in the back half of the year than we did in the first half of the year. And couple that with the foreign exchanges moving from a negative to a positive, and I think that shows where we could get to.

This morning, we reported a $1.56 billion pretax profit, our 12th consecutive record quarterly result, as the business continues to benefit from low fuel prices and solid demand. We held our top line roughly flat and realized substantial fuel savings, which allowed us to expand operating margins by nearly 10 points to 18.5% and generate $1.4 billion in operating cash flows. These are nothing short of outstanding results in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, where we also saw additional pressure from the tragic events that occurred in Brussels in late March.
Operationally, we again led the global industry with a 99.4% completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 86.5%. We had 49 perfect mainline completion days and 6 additional days where the only canceled flights in our network were to Brussels. It's now more rare to have a day with a cancellation than not on our mainline product.
We also had 8 days of no cancellations across the entire Delta system, both mainline and regional carriers, what we call brand perfect days, and we are focusing more and more on the system level performance and working hard to improve on this basis.
With these results, the Delta team proved yet again they are the very best in the industry. I'm proud to announce we accrued $272 million in profit-sharing this quarter on top of the $23 million in Shared Rewards they earned.
I want to thank the Delta team for a terrific quarter. It's an honor to be able to lead this great company and serve all of you.
I'd like to take a moment to thank Richard for his leadership and vision in transforming Delta. Richard has been a great partner and mentor for me for the past decade. And while he'll be enjoying a well-earned retirement, he will always be a trusted friend and adviser, and we all benefit from his leadership as the Executive Chairman of our board.
Our strategy is working, and our team is fully in place. We've got Gil West, our Chief Operating Officer, who leads the best team of operators in the industry. Glen Hauenstein, our new President, has led our network in revenue transformation over the last decade. Steve Sear has taken us to 5 consecutive Business Travel News victories as head of our sales organization. Paul, Joanne, Peter, Kevin, the list goes on. Our bench is deep, and we're going to keep building on our momentum.
While we continue to post record profits, we are very aware that fuel prices remain volatile and have increased nearly 60% from the lows earlier this year. For this reason, we are determined to get our business back on the path to positive unit revenues, because this is how we ensure that the margins and cash flows that we are producing are sustainable, through good times and bad. Glen will be describing our actions along this course.
As we look ahead at Delta, we have tremendous momentum in the business. While lower for longer fuel prices have added some painful uncertainty to our time line and getting back to unit revenue growth, they are also driving roughly $3 billion of fuel savings this year, and we are committed to pushing as much of that fuel savings to the bottom line as possible.
We estimate that we retained 50% of fuel savings in the first quarter on an ex-hedged basis. On a net-hedged basis, our fuel savings retention was 75%.
We're using the cash flows generated by these record earnings to invest in long-term profitable growth opportunities for the business, improving the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding the pension and continuing to return cash to owners. As we've done for the past several years, we plan to update you on our long-term plan and capital deployment strategy at our upcoming Spring Analyst Meeting, which will be held this year on May 16.
I've been asked many a times over the last couple of months, as I take over as CEO, as to what my priorities will be as we look to the future. Our goal as a team will be to continue to invest in the initiatives that are producing a durable, sustainable and industry-leading foundation at Delta.
First, our top priority is running a safe, reliable and customer-focused operation. This is at the very core of what we do. It is producing meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction. It also translates into our industry-leading RASM premium and a more efficient cost structure, both of which contribute to more sustainable margins over the long term.
Second is enhancing our brand premium. We said before that our product is not a commodity. In order to earn a premium price from customers, we need to produce a premium product and a brand that drives loyalty, that starts with thoughtful service and reliable operations, but also includes consistent innovation across the entire travel experience.
Third, you'll see us continue on the path towards globalization. Whether through initiatives like headquartering our trans-Atlantic operations in Amsterdam or through our equity stakes in Virgin Atlanta -- Atlantic, China Eastern, Aeromexico and GOL, we see the international marketplace as the source of long-term profitable growth opportunities. Our goal is to be the best U.S. global airline.
And finally, we'll maintain the balanced approach for all our stakeholders, our employees, our owners and the customers and communities we serve share in Delta's success. This strategy has driven tremendous value for all our stakeholders and is the foundation for sustainable performance over the long term.
I'm excited about the future of Delta Air Lines and honored to lead the very best team of airline professionals in the world. I thank our investors for the trust they place in us, and assure you we are working hard be great stewards of your investment.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to my good friend, Glen Hauenstein."

Our revenues for the quarter were roughly flat to last year, including $125 million headwind from currency and a $5 million impact from the recent events in Brussels. We also maintained our top line performance despite a 40% decline in market fuel prices.
Our corporate demand remained solid with volume growth of 2% this quarter. We saw increases across most sectors, including health care, financial services and technology. However, the improvement in volumes is being more than offset by lower yields.
The outlook for corporate demand remains favorable with 82% of respondents to our latest corporate travel manager survey projecting their overall travel spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of the year. This is consistent with outlooks from previous surveys.
We continue to see good performance with our Branded Fare initiatives. Total merchandising revenues grew over 30% for the quarter, led by Comfort+ growth of 45% and First Class revenue growth of 12%.
Basic Economy drove [ph] roughly $20 million in incremental revenue, and we began our broad city level expansion initiative during the quarter.
Our partnership with American Express produced $80 million in incremental value this quarter, and we expect $265 million in incremental value for the year.
Year-to-date, new card acquisitions are at record levels and up substantially from 2015. Spend on our cards is up double digits. We continue to work with our great partners at AmEx to produce innovative program offerings for our customers and continue to grow our portfolio.
Our passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with roughly 2 points of the decline attributable to currency. This result was at the low end of our initial guidance as we continued to see choppiness in the domestic close-in yield environment during the quarter.
Focusing on our domestic business, unit revenues declined 5% on 6% more capacity, 1 point of that growth attributable to leap day.
All of our domestic hubs improved margins in the quarter with the best performances in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Minneapolis.
Our investments in markets like New York and Seattle are continuing to pay off as we drove margin expansion in excess of the domestic average in both of these cities.
Our international business is still facing headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges as well as economic and geopolitical challenges in certain regions, all of which we continue to address with capacity actions.
The trans-Atlantic entity saw unit revenue decline of 6% on a 3.5% reduction in capacity, driven by a 4-point headwind from currency and pressure on yields, as industry capacity grew in the high single digits during the normally slow season.
In our core European markets, U.S. point-of-sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels. On the flip side, European point-of-sale demand has been softer, largely due to the weaker euro.
We are pleased with our performance in London, and we continue to benefit from a deeper integration with Virgin Atlantic and the network changes we made together in 2015.
Paris unit revenues improved year-over-year, as travel to the region rebounded following the events of last November.
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 9% with 5% of the decline attributable to currency, largely driven by the Brazilian real.
Mexico and Caribbean markets performed well during the quarter and have remained resilient throughout the peak spring travel period. 
Zika-related cancellations had a very small impact on Latin America.
Our Brazil capacity has been reduced by nearly 30% from peak levels, while our modest capacity growth has been well absorbed in Mexico and the Caribbean. 
In the Pacific, PRASM declines are moderating with unit revenues down 5%, including roughly 8 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges.
The yen was a $35 million headwind in the quarter, $30 million of which was driven by lower year-on-year hedge gains. While the recent appreciation of the yen is a positive for our business, we will see roughly a 4-point headwind to trans-Pacific RASM from lower hedge gains through the remainder of the year.
Capacity to the Pacific declined 9% this quarter, primarily driven by Japan. This is part of our continuing Pacific restructuring, which includes the ongoing retirement of our 747 fleet.
Our China business continues to mature as do our partnerships with China Eastern and China Southern. Today, between 15% and 20% of our customers are traveling beyond Shanghai and Beijing to our partners' networks. We expect that number to steadily increase over time.
Demand in China and the broader Pacific held up well for the first quarter, although yields remained under pressure due to high levels of industry capacity growth in the region.
Looking ahead, we are forecasting that second quarter unit revenues will be down 2.5% to 4.5%, a sequential improvement from our first quarter revenue results, on a 2% year-on-year capacity increase.
While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive RASMs. Volatility in close-in yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected. But we continue to target reaching the inflection point this year. We have a good line of sight to getting there in domestic, encouraged by the recent yield trends, which are now beginning to turn positive after being down for roughly a year.
In addition to our domestic capacity -- in addition, our domestic capacity growth moderates with each successive quarter during the year.
In LatAm and the Pacific, our capacity actions and restructuring efforts will continue to benefit us, while currency headwinds are also easing. We continue to expect unit revenues to inflect in both entities in the summer time frame.
In the trans-Atlantic, which accounts for 15% to 20% of our revenues is where we have the greatest challenge. Yields remained under pressure as industry capacity growth continues to outstrip demand.
Peak season volumes from U.S. to Europe remained very strong and will drive record profits this summer given the low fuel prices. And one positive is that we will get a big help from currency as it turns from a headwind into a tailwind beginning in the next quarter.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are focused on taking the necessary actions to get to positive RASM in 2016 and ahead of our network competitors, if for no other reason than to get Ed off my back. We will have a line of sight to achieving our goal in domestic, the Pacific and Latin America, we are addressing the headwinds we face in Europe and we will act quickly to move all the levers in our business, including capacity, if we do not see sufficient progress in the coming months.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul."

While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment, and we know fuel won't stay low permanently. As a r",802,"Thanks, Glen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment, and we know fuel won't stay low permanently. As a result, we remain focused on staying disciplined with our costs.
Total operating expenses for the quarter, however, were down more than $1 billion as this decline in fuel costs offset wage increases as well as higher profit-sharing expense, which doubled versus last year at this quarter.
Nonfuel CASM increased 4.5%, including profit sharing, better than our initial expectation, with roughly half of that increase coming from higher profit-sharing in the quarter.
As you may recall, our cost growth is more weighted toward the front half of the year given the timing of last year's wage increases and this quarter is the peak.
During the quarter, we retired 10 older mainline aircraft, including 9 757s and 1 767-300. We removed 6 50-seaters from our schedule also during the quarter. We continue to expect our re-fleeting efforts to drive another $350 million of savings in 2016.
Our maintenance initiatives benefited us by $90 million in the quarter, and we continue to target a $400 million benefit for the whole -- for the full year.
For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel CASM, including profit sharing to increase roughly 2% as our productivity and other cost initiatives help offset higher wages and product and service investments. CASM growth in the second quarter will be well below 1Q levels as we lap last year's April 1 wage increase. We remain on track to keep nonfuel costs ex profit-sharing below 2% for the full year.
Moving on to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $1.5 billion due to lower market fuel prices and lower year-over-year hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down 55% from the prior year.
The refinery lost a modest $28 million in the quarter. While lower crack spreads are a headwind for the refinery, they are obviously a significant net benefit for Delta as a whole.
Looking ahead, we expect an all-in June quarter fuel price of $1.48 to $1.53, which is down 40% from prior year. We continue to have no open hedges going forward and anticipate hedge losses of approximately $200 million in each of the remaining quarters this year.
With the combination of the fuel tailwind, our nonfuel cost discipline and the sequential improvement in RASM performance Glen discussed, we expect another record quarter in June with an operating margin of 21% to 23%, a roughly 5-point improvement from the prior year.
On cash flow, we are using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the long-term investments we are making in the business, while continuing to return cash to our owners and derisking the balance sheet. 
As Ed mentioned, we generated $1.35 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. This was net of $1.5 billion in profit-sharing payouts to employees for 2015 and an $825 million cash contribution to the pension plan. We also contributed $350 million in Delta stock during -- to the pension during the quarter.
With the additional $100 million in cash we put in the plans this month, we have contributed $1.3 billion in cash and stock since the beginning of the year. This completes our funding for 2016.
We reinvested $870 million back into the business during the quarter. As you may recall, we expect higher capital spending in the first half of the year due to the timing of aircraft spend, and we'll spend roughly $1 billion again in the second quarter. Additionally, this year, we expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the third quarter.
In the March quarter, we returned $880 million to shareholders, including the $350 million accelerated share repurchase we completed to offset the dilution from the contribution to the pension plan.
Adjusted net debt at the end of March was $7 billion, up slightly from year-end due to the timing of cash flows, including pension funding and profit sharing, and the decision we made to stay on track for a run rate for buybacks during the quarter. We expect our adjusted net debt to be below $6 billion by year-end with our cash flow.
We've made significant progress on delevering our business over the last decade. And we are pleased to have this recognized with an upgrade by Moody's to investment grade during the quarter.
In closing, I'd like to thank and congratulate the entire Delta team not only for another record quarter, but also for achieving our long-held goal of returning as an investment-grade company. These accomplishments would not have been possible without your determination, dedication and hard work each and every day. Jill, back to you."

This is not a short-term need, it's a medium-term need because the MD-88s do need to retire, and we have roughly 115 of them currently. And we also need to continue to upgauge our regional flying to the mainline, which we've had a lot of success in, and there's much more to go and I think we can do it cost effectively. There's been a lot of media reports. We have nothing to report at this time. There is no decisions taken. So I will not comment on any media reports.

And on the other side in Europe itself, you have some of the growth from the ultra-low cost carriers that are attempting now to fly in the trans-Atlantic, such as Norwegian as well as some of the majors like Air Canada. So when you add all that together, you get a trans-Atlantic capacity increase that is in the high single digits, low double digit through the peak summer season.

But whether or not we include the fuel, there's traditionally been more improvement from the first quarter to the second, historically, for Delta anywhere from, call it, 500 to 800 basis points. So today's guide is obviously below that range. Shouldn't consolidated industry be showing a little bit more seasonality not less as we move into peak periods? Any idea what might be contributing to this?"

I think when you look at just where we are in this particular quarter-to-quarter, you've got a move in fuel that if you just look at our -- the midpoint of our guide for 2Q against our 1Q actual, has moved up almost $200 million for that impact. And while RASM is improving sequentially, it's not keeping up with that pace in the very, very short term. I don't think that's a judgment on consolidation. I think it's just on the volatility of where we are. Despite that move in fuel, we're sitting roughly at where we ended up at year-end, so I think there's a little bit of intra-quarter noise movement going on with those short term market generations."

I appreciate, and I'm sure most equity investors on this call probably appreciate your admirable goal of getting back to positive year-over-year unit revenue growth. I guess what I'm less certain of is whether sustained unit revenue growth is actually achievable over the next few years with returns running as high as they are across the industry which, to me, would appear likely to drive continued at least mid-single digit supply growth, which is kind of what we've been seeing. So just wondering and maybe perhaps just focusing on the domestic market, assuming the current status quo of low single-digit GDP growth, fuel in kind of the low to mid-40s per barrel and then continued mid-single-digit domestic supply growth across the industry, how do you really establish any confidence that you can get to sustained unit revenue growth and understandably, demand is going to kind of ebb and flow and maybe you can get there for a quarter or 2, but just any color on sort of how you can get there and sustain there given the return profile across the industry?"

There will be about 2 years of contraction, which were caused really by the fuel price being cut in less than half. And I think if you look at the correlation to fuel and unit revenues, over time, you'll see a very tight correlation in the longer term. And so as you -- depending on what your fuel assumption is, if you see fuel bottoming at 27 in the December time period and then you see a gradual improvement, although longer -- lower-for-longer, I think that ultimately will be reflected in ticket prices, and that's one of the reasons I think we're relatively confident that we will get to a higher unit revenue in the back half of the year than we did in the first half of the year. And couple that with the foreign exchanges moving from a negative to a positive, and I think that shows where we could get to.

For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47 beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset the decline in revenues as we continue to face persistence unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service and in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. 
More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. We have achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take 1 point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we have decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner Virgin Atlanta who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. 
For Delta, these changes along with other network actions will take roughly 1 point of capacity out of the system. And we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year. Glen will take you through the details. But I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we are working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if ultimately it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident that we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a market improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, and easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions as you saw announced this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings, driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. 
All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer-term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. Strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain our rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business, day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15% plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long-term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry-leading revenues while delivering unparalleled lever of reliability and great customer service every day. 
Turning to our June quarter performance. Revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see closing domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes, producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply demand imbalances primarily in the trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiatives remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see a strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-over-year. Comfort+ paid load factory increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of upsell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout, scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic and Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage some time in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter and we expect over $300 million for the year. New current acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over our record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express team for the great success we've had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading cobrand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team has focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with sales growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other had, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remained strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post-summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength and leisure demand and yields reduce capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion for unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter. But June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remains solid and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM, consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge days. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partially offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. As the business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we have more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. $70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. 
Excluding hedges. We achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, our focus on higher you yielding U.S. point of sales traffic and recovery in the Japan point-of-sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter and we continue to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions, along with a stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2%. While the industry compete increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. 
In the second quarter, Delta and Air France KLM began a code share agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the seasonal nature of the India market, we expect to have a positive impact on the fourth quarter trans-Atlantic revenues. In the U.K., Delta's British pound denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K. or in leisure markets. These changes combined with other actions we're taking will results in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. 
Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the trans-Atlantic to inflect until sometime in '17. At a system-level with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit and as currency and fuel surcharge ease and the bulk capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. While we haven't seen a desire traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."

Good morning, everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution again this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range before the 4-point headwind from the early fuel hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and products and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our upgauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings, drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost including profit sharing to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we are forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter, with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries in modification projects. We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we are driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or returns to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With an additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we have completed our funding commitment for the year. The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We are now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with a strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. As we announced in our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure and we are focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

I think what we didn't expect in the beginning of the year was the continuation and acceleration of the declines in the business traffic sector. So what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure. And that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and is in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the closing yield weakness that we've seen. So that's how it played out and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be as we have said in the earnings call, it's stubbornly low close in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat. Because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that is in the minus 4 or 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out. That's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned for the summer capacity, that is back in the February, March time period. And while we -- we're looking in the rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47, beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset the decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service, and in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. 
We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or one out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. 
We have achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores, and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take one point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. 
Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we've decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner, virgin Atlantic, who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. For Delta, these changes, along with other network actions, will take roughly one point of capacity out of the system, and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year.   
Glen will take you through the details, but I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we're working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if, ultimately, it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a market improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, an easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. 
And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions, as you saw us announced this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. 
Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. 
First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. A strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business, day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15% plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry-leading revenues by delivering an unparalleled lever of reliability and great customer service every day. 
Turning to our June quarter performance. Revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see close-in domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes, producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply demand imbalances, primarily in the trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-over-year. 
Comfort+ paid load factor increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing our product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. 
Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter, and we expect over $300 million for the year. New card acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over a record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express team for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading co-brand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team is focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. 
Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with Delta's growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other had, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remained strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength in leisure demand and yields, reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long-AP leisure fares. T should provide a cushion to unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter, but June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid, and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points, and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. 
As a business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we had more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. $70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly one point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. Excluding hedges. We achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, a focus on higher-yielding U.S. point-of-sale traffic and recovery in the Japan point-of-sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. 
The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter, and we continue to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners, China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. 
For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions, along with a stronger yen, to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2% while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM, and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. 
In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France-KLM began a codeshare agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the contra-seasonal nature of the Indian market, we expect to have a positive impact on fourth quarter trans-Atlantic revenues. 
In the U.K., Delta's British pound-denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned, along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K.-origin leisure markets. These changes, combined with other actions we're taking, will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the trans-Atlantic to reflect until sometime in '17. 
At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the bulk capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven't seen the desired traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."

We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contributo",833,"Thanks, Glen, and thanks to your entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. 
Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range, before the 4-point headwind from the early fuel hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment, and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry, and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost including profit sharing to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter, and we expect the lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we are forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries and modification projects. 
We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we're driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we have completed our funding commitment for the year. 
The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We're now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with a strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. 
As we announced in our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure, and we're focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

So what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure, and that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we've seen. And so that's how it played out, and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be, as we have said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat, because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that's in the minus 4 or 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 and a 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out, and that's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity, that was back in the February, March time period, and while we  were looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust, and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

And the lag time that produces the highest R-squared is about 9 months. So that's over a very, very long period of time within the industry. And I think that's what we are counting on as that -- on the margin, when fuel was $25, there were players who were pricing their products at the incremental marginal cost to $25 fuel. That marginal cost of production has gone up substantially since the low point, and normally, it would take about 9 months for that to flow through to airline revenues."

Thanks to everyone for joining us. For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47, beating consensus by $0.05. Stro",947,"Thanks, Jill. Good morning. Thanks to everyone for joining us. 
For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47, beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset a decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service, that in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. 
We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. 
We've achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores, and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. 
Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take 1 point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. 
Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we've decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. For Delta, these changes, along with other network actions, will take roughly 1 point of capacity out of the system, and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year.   
Glen will take you through the details, but I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we're working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if, ultimately, it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a marked improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, an easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. 
And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions, as you saw us announce this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. 
Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. 
First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. A strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15%-plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

We continue to see close-in domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply/demand imbalances primarily in the Trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-on-year. 
Comfort+ paid load factor increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. 
Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter, and we expect over $300 million for the year. New card acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over a record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express teams for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading cobrand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team is focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. 
Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with Delta's growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum-stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other hand, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remains strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength in leisure demand and yields, reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long-AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion to unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter, but June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. 
Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid, and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. 
For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points, and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. 
As a business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we had more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. 
$70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. Excluding hedges, we achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, a focus on higher-yielding U.S. point of sale traffic and recovery in the Japan point of sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. 
The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter, and we continued to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners, China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. 
For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions along with a stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the Trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2% while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the Trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM, and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. 
In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France-KLM began a codeshare agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the contra-seasonal nature of the Indian market, we expect that to have a positive impact on fourth quarter Trans-Atlantic revenues. 
In the U.K., Delta's British pound-denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned, along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K.-origin leisure markets. These changes, combined with other actions we're taking, will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the Trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the Trans-Atlantic to reflect until sometime in '17. 
At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the fall capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven't seen the desired traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."
266311,372485795,1006932,"Delta Air Lines, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Delta Air Lines, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Glen, and thanks to your entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone, and appreciate you joining us this morning.

Good morning, everyone, and appreciate you joining us this morning. 
Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range before the 4-point headwind from the early fuel hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment, and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. 
I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry, and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost, including profit sharing, to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. 
The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter, and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we're forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries and modification projects. 
We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we're driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we've completed our funding commitment for the year. 
The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We're now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with this strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. 
As we announced at our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure, and we're focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we've seen. And so that's how it played out, and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be as we've said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that's in the minus 4, 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out, and that's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity, that was back in the February, March time period, and while we were looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust, and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

Thanks to everyone for joining us. For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow.

For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47, beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset a decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service, that in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. 
We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. 
We've achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores, and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. 
Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take one point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. 
Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we've decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. For Delta, these changes, along with other network actions, will take roughly one point of capacity out of the system, and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year.   
Glen will take you through the details, but I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we're working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if, ultimately, it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a marked improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, an easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. 
And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions, as you saw us announce this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. 
Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. 
First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. A strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15%-plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry-leading revenues by delivering an unparalleled level of reliability and great customer service every day. 
Turning to our June quarter performance. Revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see close-in domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply/demand imbalances primarily in the Trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-on-year. 
Comfort+ paid load factor increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. 
Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter, and we expect over $300 million for the year. New card acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over a record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express teams for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading cobrand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team is focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. 
Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with Delta's growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum-stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other hand, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remains strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength in leisure demand and yields, reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long-AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion to unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter, but June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. 
Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid, and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. 
For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points, and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. 
As a business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we had more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. 
$70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. Excluding hedges, we achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, a focus on higher-yielding U.S. point of sale traffic and recovery in the Japan point of sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. 
The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter, and we continued to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners, China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. 
For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions along with a stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the Trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2% while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the Trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM, and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. 
In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France-KLM began a codeshare agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the contra-seasonal nature of the Indian market, we expect that to have a positive impact on fourth quarter Trans-Atlantic revenues. 
In the U.K., Delta's British pound-denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned, along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K.-origin leisure markets. These changes, combined with other actions we're taking, will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the Trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the Trans-Atlantic to reflect until sometime in '17. 
At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the fall capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven't seen the desired traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."

While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment, and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. 
I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry, and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost, including profit sharing, to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. 
The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter, and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we're forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries and modification projects. 
We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we're driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we've completed our funding commitment for the year. 
The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We're now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with this strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. 
As we announced at our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure, and we're focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

So what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure, and that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we've seen. And so that's how it played out, and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be as we've said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that's in the minus 4, 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out, and that's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity, that was back in the February, March time period, and while we were looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust, and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

It's the way you're approaching the time value for time-sensitive customers and are you getting what people would be willing to pay for their time versus what the market is charging for time. And if you look, business fares -- as these quarters roll out with government -- we can all look at it. But what I think you'll see is that the business fares are well below where they have been historically. And in a lot of markets where there have been little capacity, even no capacity, even negative capacity changes over the medium term. So I hear your question, and I wish I had the best answer for why that is there. But I think, like everything, it's a part of a cycle. I think it has to do with lower fuel, and I think as higher fuel rolls through, everybody's P&Ls that there'll be a lot more focus on that. But that's not -- we're a small percentage of the industry. We represent less than 20% of the total industry. So we don't have that kind of power of predictions to be able to go out and say those things."

For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47 beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset the decline in revenues as we continue to face persistence unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service and in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. 
More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. We have achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take 1 point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we have decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner Virgin Atlanta who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. 
For Delta, these changes along with other network actions will take roughly 1 point of capacity out of the system. And we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year. Glen will take you through the details. But I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we are working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if ultimately it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident that we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a market improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, and easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions as you saw announced this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings, driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. 
All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer-term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. Strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain our rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business, day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15% plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long-term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry-leading revenues while delivering unparalleled lever of reliability and great customer service every day. 
Turning to our June quarter performance. Revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see closing domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes, producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply demand imbalances primarily in the trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiatives remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see a strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-over-year. Comfort+ paid load factory increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of upsell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout, scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic and Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage some time in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter and we expect over $300 million for the year. New current acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over our record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express team for the great success we've had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading cobrand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team has focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with sales growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other had, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remained strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post-summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength and leisure demand and yields reduce capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion for unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter. But June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remains solid and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM, consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge days. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partially offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. As the business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we have more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. $70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. 
Excluding hedges. We achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, our focus on higher you yielding U.S. point of sales traffic and recovery in the Japan point-of-sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter and we continue to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions, along with a stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2%. While the industry compete increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. 
In the second quarter, Delta and Air France KLM began a code share agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the seasonal nature of the India market, we expect to have a positive impact on the fourth quarter trans-Atlantic revenues. In the U.K., Delta's British pound denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K. or in leisure markets. These changes combined with other actions we're taking will results in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. 
Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the trans-Atlantic to inflect until sometime in '17. At a system-level with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit and as currency and fuel surcharge ease and the bulk capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. While we haven't seen a desire traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."

Good morning, everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution again this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range before the 4-point headwind from the early fuel hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and products and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our upgauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings, drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost including profit sharing to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we are forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter, with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries in modification projects. We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we are driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or returns to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With an additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we have completed our funding commitment for the year. The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We are now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with a strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. As we announced in our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure and we are focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

I think what we didn't expect in the beginning of the year was the continuation and acceleration of the declines in the business traffic sector. So what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure. And that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and is in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the closing yield weakness that we've seen. So that's how it played out and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be as we have said in the earnings call, it's stubbornly low close in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat. Because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that is in the minus 4 or 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out. That's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned for the summer capacity, that is back in the February, March time period. And while we -- we're looking in the rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

And I think that's what we are counting on as that on the margin when the fuel was $25, there were players who were pricing their products at the incremental marginal cost to $25 fuel. That marginal cost of production has gone up substantially since the low point. And normally, it's a take about 9 months for that to flow through to airline revenues."

For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47, beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset the decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service, and in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. 
We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or one out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. 
We have achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores, and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take one point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. 
Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we've decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner, virgin Atlantic, who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. For Delta, these changes, along with other network actions, will take roughly one point of capacity out of the system, and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year.   
Glen will take you through the details, but I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we're working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if, ultimately, it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a market improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, an easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. 
And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions, as you saw us announced this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. 
Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. 
First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. A strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business, day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15% plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry-leading revenues by delivering an unparalleled lever of reliability and great customer service every day. 
Turning to our June quarter performance. Revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see close-in domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes, producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply demand imbalances, primarily in the trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-over-year. 
Comfort+ paid load factor increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing our product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. 
Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter, and we expect over $300 million for the year. New card acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over a record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express team for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading co-brand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team is focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. 
Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with Delta's growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other had, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remained strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength in leisure demand and yields, reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long-AP leisure fares. T should provide a cushion to unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter, but June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid, and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points, and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. 
As a business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we had more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. $70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly one point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. Excluding hedges. We achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, a focus on higher-yielding U.S. point-of-sale traffic and recovery in the Japan point-of-sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. 
The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter, and we continue to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners, China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. 
For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions, along with a stronger yen, to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2% while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM, and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. 
In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France-KLM began a codeshare agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the contra-seasonal nature of the Indian market, we expect to have a positive impact on fourth quarter trans-Atlantic revenues. 
In the U.K., Delta's British pound-denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned, along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K.-origin leisure markets. These changes, combined with other actions we're taking, will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the trans-Atlantic to reflect until sometime in '17. 
At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the bulk capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven't seen the desired traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."
266311,372485795,1007285,"Delta Air Lines, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Delta Air Lines, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Glen, and thanks to your entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contributo",833,"Thanks, Glen, and thanks to your entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. 
Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range, before the 4-point headwind from the early fuel hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment, and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry, and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost including profit sharing to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter, and we expect the lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we are forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries and modification projects. 
We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we're driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we have completed our funding commitment for the year. 
The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We're now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with a strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. 
As we announced in our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure, and we're focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

So what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure, and that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we've seen. And so that's how it played out, and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be, as we have said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat, because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that's in the minus 4 or 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 and a 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out, and that's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity, that was back in the February, March time period, and while we  were looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust, and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

And certainly, by the time we get to the planning for the spring, if conditions are the same, we're going to continue to take the same path on capacity."

For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit, and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47, beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset a decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it's more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service, that in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry's best operation. 
We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with 0 mainline cancellations. More importantly, we had 23 days of 0 system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. 
We've achieved all-time highs in our Net Promoter Scores, and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. 
Congratulations to the entire Delta team, and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million accrued towards our profit-sharing program, bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. 
Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take 1 point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. 
Now with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we've decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the U.K. for the winter IATA season. We've also been working closely with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall U.K. capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. For Delta, these changes, along with other network actions, will take roughly 1 point of capacity out of the system, and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year.   
Glen will take you through the details, but I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we're working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if, ultimately, it takes a little bit longer than year-end, we're confident we're on the right path. 
We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we're anticipating a marked improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives, an easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. 
And if we're not seeing the right progress in our results as we move through the fall, we're prepared to take additional actions, as you saw us announce this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us. Market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pretax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. 
Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we'll continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. 
First, we'll continue to strengthen our brand around the world. A strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we'll maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides a solid foundation for the business day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15%-plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we'll use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. 
So to conclude. Our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track, and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn the call now over to Glen."

While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry-leading revenues by delivering an unparalleled level of reliability and great customer service every day. 
Turning to our June quarter performance. Revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see close-in domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply/demand imbalances primarily in the Trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. 
While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-on-year. 
Comfort+ paid load factor increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of '17. 
We now have rolled out our Basic Economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun, and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year '18. 
Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter, and we expect over $300 million for the year. New card acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over a record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express teams for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading cobrand offering to our mutual customers. 
While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team is focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year-end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. 
Domestically, our unit revenues declined 6% on a 5% capacity growth for the June quarter. And while absolute volumes for business traffic remains solid, quite simply, they did not keep pace with Delta's growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum-stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other hand, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remains strong. So going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post summer schedule that begins late August. 
With continued strength in leisure demand and yields, reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher-yielding, long-AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion to unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September time frame and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. 
In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter, but June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. 
Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand, and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid, and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. 
For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 to 3 points, and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. 
Moving to the Pacific. The 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from -- negative fuel searches -- surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. 
As a business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However, in 2015, we had more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. 
$70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. Excluding hedges, we achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter, held by our capacity adjustments, a focus on higher-yielding U.S. point of sale traffic and recovery in the Japan point of sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. 
The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter, and we continued to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners, China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. 
For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions along with a stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. 
Finally, in the Trans-Atlantic entity, Delta's second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2% while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressure in yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the Trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM, and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. 
In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of 5, but double-digit low-cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France-KLM began a codeshare agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the contra-seasonal nature of the Indian market, we expect that to have a positive impact on fourth quarter Trans-Atlantic revenues. 
In the U.K., Delta's British pound-denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven't seen a material impact on volumes. But as Ed mentioned, along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the U.K. for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on U.K.-origin leisure markets. These changes, combined with other actions we're taking, will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the Trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the Trans-Atlantic to reflect until sometime in '17. 
At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the fall capacity changes begin to be implemented. 
So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven't seen the desired traction in our unit revenues, we're taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year-end and ahead of our network peers. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson."
266311,372485795,1007286,"Delta Air Lines, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Delta Air Lines, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Glen, and thanks to your entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone, and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contribut",831,"Thanks, Glen, and thanks to your entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they're undergoing. Good morning, everyone, and appreciate you joining us this morning. 
Consistent cost execution, again, this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range before the 4-point headwind from the early fuel hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment, and we must remain vigilant on those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. 
Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. 
I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry, and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our nonfuel unit cost, including profit sharing, to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. 
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. 
The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter, and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don't expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. 
Now let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we're forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. 
Moving on to cash flow. We generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries and modification projects. 
We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we're driving for with each dollar we spend, whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners. 
We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we've completed our funding commitment for the year. 
The progress we have made on derisking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We're now proud that 2 of the 3 rating agencies have provided us with this strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. 
As we announced at our May analyst meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. 
In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We're going to continue to stretch ourselves. We're going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure, and we're focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company.

So what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure, and that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we've seen. And so that's how it played out, and that leaves us with really no other choice but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward because we can't count on it to be as we've said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So what we need to do now is not go into a month flat because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that's in the minus 4, 5 range. So we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month, knowing we're going to give away some of that yield within the month. So that's kind of how it played out, and that's how we're looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity, that was back in the February, March time period, and while we were looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So it's not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it's really robust, and we're going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward."

So I hear your question, and I wish I had the best answer for why that is there. But I think, like everything, it's a part of a cycle.

This morning, Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65. The resiliency of our business and our people stood out this quarter as we generated a solid 19% operating margin, $1.1 billion of free cash flow despite the weakest revenue environment in recent memory and the impact of the $150 million technology outage.
We apologize once more to those who were impacted by the outage and have already taken action to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their great efforts not only through the disruption, but also as [indiscernible] to restore customers' confidence in Delta's reliability.
Even with the impact of the outage, we delivered solid operations with a 99% mainline completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 84% for the quarter. Importantly, of the 22 systemwide perfect completion factor days we had this quarter, what we call brand perfect days with both Delta and Delta Connection having perfect completion on all 5,500 daily flights, 21 of them came after the events in August. So the operation is back and running stronger than ever and our team proved once more why they are the very best.
I'm pleased to say we've added another $325 million towards next year's profit sharing for our employees, bringing the total so far this year to $920 million.
While the outage was a onetime event, the bigger challenge we face is from continued unit revenue declines, a trend that has persisted for the last 7 quarters. And while our strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to keep margins consistent with last year and the September quarter, market fuel prices looked to be higher in the upcoming quarter for the first time in several years. Therefore, it continues to be a top priority for us to return to positive RASM in order to stabilize our margin performance and demonstrate the durability of the business model we have built.
Capacity is a significant lever. We can use to impact that performance. And based on our RASM results earlier this year, we made the decision to lower our capacity growth to below 2% for the September quarter. And while the pace of improvement has been slower than we hoped, our unit revenues have started to move in the right direction with these lower capacity levels to which Glen will provide greater detail. That said, RASM remains negative and we'll stay conservative with our capacity, capping growth at 1% for the fourth quarter, a level of growth that we plan to carry over throughout 2017.
With this cautious approach, we can focus on firming the trends that have us on track for positive unit revenues likely sometime early next year. This will go a long way towards demonstrating that Delta can sustain solid profits, margins and cash flows throughout the business cycle and provide further evidence that we have built a durable and sustainable model that warrants an improved valuation.
I want to thank the management and ALPA negotiating teams who worked tirelessly to get to the agreement in principle that we reached with our pilots 2 weeks ago. The potential agreement recognizes the important leadership role our pilots play in Delta's long-term success. It is now going through ALPA's approval and ratification process and, to respect that process, we're not going to comment any further than what I've just said.
Finally, in closing, I want to thank Richard for his leadership, his courage and his friendship to us all at Delta as he is now fully retired. Richard has been a transformative leader at Delta as well as for the industry. He is a true servant leader as he served all 80,000 of us from his heart.
We are fortunate to have Frank Blake, another outstanding leader, as our new Chairman. We look forward to working closely with Frank as we build an even stronger and more durable franchise for the future.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Glen."

I would also like to start by thanking the Delta people for their perseverance through a challenging quarter. It is your hard work and dedication that sets Delta apart in our customers' eyes, and that translates into the revenue premium we realized for the industry.
As Ed mentioned, the biggest challenge we face as a company is the persistent decline of unit revenue. This quarter, our RASM was down 6.8%, including roughly one point of impact from the August outage and an additional point of headwind as we lapped the yen hedge gained from last year.
Excluding our outage, our unit revenues were at the bottom end of our initial guidance range and we attribute that shortfall primarily to 2 factors. First, the transatlantic proved more challenging than we expected given the supply demand imbalance in the region caused by multiple terrorist events, low-cost carrier growth and Brexit, which we are primarily seeing in the devaluation of the British pound.  Second, the domestic close-in yield environment was weaker than expected in the first half of the quarter, particularly in early August.
Overall domestic unit revenues declined 7% on 4% capacity growth in the September quarter, with nearly 2 points of the decline attributable to the August outage. While this result was weaker than we initially anticipated, we did see improvement as we went through the quarter, particularly as we lowered our capacity levels with our forced -- fall schedule in mid-August and adjusted some revenue management strategies. The improvement was most evident in September when domestic unit revenue declines moderated to 2.5% for the month, driven primarily by improving business revenues.
It is these trends that give us cautious optimism that we will have a path to positive RASM in the domestic entity in the December, January time frame; if not, shortly thereafter. To get there, we will slow our domestic capacity growth further in the fourth quarter to 2.5% year-over-year, which is less than half the rate we grew during the first 3 quarters of the year. We believe this lower capacity profile will position us to achieve a better RASM result during the upcoming off-peak season.
As I mentioned, we adjusted our revenue management strategies. As we have rolled out this new approach, we have seen close-in yields strengthen and we are working to build on this trend going forward. In September, over 1/3 of our domestic networks our RASM improved year-over-year, up from a low of 15% that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that percentage to exceed 50% over the next 90 days.
There are some calendar delays over the next few months, but we believe, on a combined basis, domestic RASM for November through January should be flattish as travel patterns shift between months due to holiday placements. And with domestic, the biggest driver of our overall system performance, this will be the major push we need to get our overall unit revenues back into positive territory.
Moving on to LatAm. I am pleased to say this is the first region to have turned the corner with a unit revenue improvement of 1.5% this quarter, the first time the LatAm entity has achieved a positive unit revenue in 2.5 years. After 16 consecutive quarters of negative results, Brazil unit revenues improved 30% year-on-year, with momentum building through the quarter as strengthening real drove more Brazil point-of-sale demand. We are seeing this positive trend continue as we head into the peak demand season.
Mexico business markets have also been a key driver on LatAm's path to positive RASM, achieving the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues. U.S. and Mexico Open Skies were ratified and took it back late August and we expect the U.S. DOT will grant antitrust immunity by year-end, paving the way for the implementation of our joint venture with Aeromexico. Delta's U.S.-Mexico scale will triple as a result of the partnership and allow us to build on the strong momentum we already have in the largest revenue market for U.S. travel to Latin America.
Regarding our 4Q '16 outlook, capacity in Latin America will remain flat as we continue to look to improve our RASM performance before growing further in the region.
Turning to the Pacific. In the September quarter, the region saw a positive RASM ex-hedge for the first time since 2013. Japan was a notable bright spot with RASM ex-hedge up 4% year-over-year spurred by a stronger yen. On the other hand, China continues to be challenged as industry capacity growth outpaced increases in demand.
Looking ahead, the industry supply demand imbalance in the Pacific will become more acute in the winter off-peak season, with industry capacity of 11% in the fourth quarter while demand is only up mid to high single digits.
We will also continue to face the headwinds as we lap last year's hedge gains. For the fourth quarter, it is a $30 million impact or about 0.5 points on system PRASM, which translates to nearly a 5 point drag on Pacific unit revenues.
While we were able to secure 2 daylight frequencies with the limiting opening of Haneda, it's forcing us to split our Tokyo operations between 2 airports, Haneda and Narita. As a result, we announced in August that we will be further restructuring the Narita hub with the winter schedule. The network changes will result in a 30% capacity reduction to and from Japan this winter and allow us to retire 2 additional 747s by the end of the year.
For the Pacific broadly, we will reduce our winter capacity by 9% to 10% as we continue to restructure our network for long-term profitability and sustainability in the region.
And finally, we get to the transatlantic. September quarter unit revenues were down 9.7% driven by overcapacity, particularly from LCCs and Middle East carriers, while terrorism concerns, sluggish economies and Brexit all lead on the demand set.
While the revenue environment was probably the most challenging, we also had a solidly profitable summer because of lower fuel. That said, as we go into the seasonally weaker period, we will reduce our capacity offering by 3 to 4 points starting in November to address the unit revenue challenges we are facing.
While we are expecting to take a bit longer to get to unit revenue growth in the transatlantic, we do expect that the pace of declines will moderate going forward. As we look out further, the transatlantic has some of the most unique competitive dynamics and we need to adopt our model to continue to leverage our existing joint ventures and seek new partners as we have done recently with Jet Airways, in addition to carefully managing our capacity in the region.
Now let me address our fourth quarter outlook. We expect system unit revenues to be down in the 3% to 5% range on a 1% capacity increase.
In closing, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the unit revenue trends we are starting to see significant portions of our network. And we expect that with a lot of hard work, we can continue to drive improvement and get to positive unit revenues by early next year. But as we have commented before, if we do not see the performance we expect as we move through the quarter, we will move quickly to make the changes we need to get the right outcome.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Thank you for joining us this morning.
Once again, this quarter, the Delta team was able to show, with our continued discipline on costs and focus on free cash flow, that we've built a solid foundation that has put us in a good position to weather the inevitable challenges we face in this business to deliver sustainable results.
Lower fuel prices drove a roughly $300 million decline in total operating expenses on a 1.5% increase in capacity. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat, including the 0.5 points impact of the outage. This result is consistent with our initial guidance as we continue to leverage the solid cost foundation we have built and deliver strong productivity savings, while we also continue to benefit from our upgauging initiatives.
We expect our nonfuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2% in the December quarter, which doesn't include any impact for a potential pilot agreement. This is slightly higher than our run rate from the past couple of quarters, but still comfortably below our 2% annual target as we're seeing some pressure from our lower capacity levels and timing of maintenance spend.
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $350 million or 18% year-over-year. We had no hedge impact during the current period given our decision to early settle our remaining 2016 positions during the June quarter.
The refinery lost $45 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations, driven by lower crack spreads. The hard work of our fuel team, coupled with the expertise we have with the refinery, has allowed us to harvest about a $0.03 per gallon unhedged fuel cost advantage over our competitors and we are focused on widening that lead. This advantage will become even more important as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, with market fuel prices already higher year-over-year for the first time in over 2 years.
We expect an all-in December quarter fuel price of $1.60 to $1.65 per gallon, which is down for us year-over-year as we paid above-market rates during the same period in 2015, but higher on a market basis.
Now let me address our margin outlook. While we expect another quarter of solid cost performance, given a waning fuel tailwind and continued RASM headwinds, we are forecasting a December quarter operating margin in the 14% to 16% range which is down roughly 2 points year-over-year. As Ed and Glen both mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment and combined with our conservative capacity plans, reinforces our focus on maintaining our margin performance. 
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We continued our balanced approach of deploying that cash with more than $650 million going back into the business as we took delivery of 11 mainline aircraft and our fleet modification projects continue. 
We expect core capital spending will be roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and we expect to spend an additional $520 million on the Aeromexico tender offer. 
We ended the September quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, down roughly $400 million sequentially from June. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and returned $650 million to our shareholders during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash we have returned to our owners year-to-date to $2.7 billion, which already exceeds the level returned during all of 2015. We remain on track to meet our goal of returning at least 70% of our free cash flow this year to our owners. 
In closing, I also want to express my gratitude to the Delta family for all of your hard work and perseverance during the quarter that allowed us to deliver cost performance that was consistent with our initial outlook despite the headwinds we experience. I'm confident that our efforts will allow us to continue to deliver sustainable results regardless of the challenges we face. Jill?"

This morning, Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65. The resiliency of our business and our people stood out this quarter as we generated a solid 19% operating margin, $1.1 billion of free cash flow despite the weakest revenue environment in recent memory and the impact of the $150 million technology outage.
We apologize once more to those who were impacted by the outage and have already taken action to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their great efforts not only through the disruption, but also as a resort to restore customers' confidence in Delta's reliability.
Even with the impact of the outage, we delivered solid operations with a 99% mainline completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 84% for the quarter. Importantly, of the 22 systemwide perfect completion factor days we had this quarter, what we call brand perfect days with both Delta and Delta Connection having perfect completion on all 5,500 daily flights, 21 of them came after the events in August. So the operation is back and running stronger than ever and our team proved once more why they are the very best.
I'm pleased to say we've added another $325 million towards next year's profit sharing for our employees, bringing the total so far this year to $920 million.
While the outage was a onetime event, the bigger challenge we face is from continued unit revenue declines, a trend that has persisted for the last 7 quarters. And while our strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to keep margins consistent with last year and the September quarter, market fuel prices looked to be higher in the upcoming quarter for the first time in several years. Therefore, it continues to be a top priority for us to return to positive RASM in order to stabilize our margin performance and demonstrate the durability of the business model we have built.
Capacity is a significant lever. We can use to impact that performance. And based on our RASM results earlier this year, we made the decision to lower our capacity growth to below 2% for the September quarter. And while the pace of improvement has been slower than we hoped, our unit revenues have started to move in the right direction with these lower capacity levels to which Glen will provide greater detail. That said, RASM remains negative and we'll stay conservative with our capacity, capping growth at 1% for the fourth quarter, a level of growth that we plan to carry over throughout 2017.
With this cautious approach, we can focus on firming the trends that have us on track for positive unit revenues likely sometime early next year. This will go a long way towards demonstrating that Delta can sustain solid profits, margins and cash flows throughout the business cycle and provide further evidence that we have built a durable and sustainable model that warrants an improved valuation.
I want to thank the management and ALPA negotiating teams who worked tirelessly to get to the agreement in principle that we reached with our pilots 2 weeks ago. The potential agreement recognizes the important leadership role our pilots play in Delta's long-term success. It is now going through ALPA's approval and ratification process and, to respect that process, we're not going to comment any further than what I've just said.
Finally, in closing, I want to thank Richard for his leadership, his courage and his friendship to us all at Delta as he is now fully retired. Richard has been a transformative leader at Delta as well as for the industry. He is a true servant leader as he served all 80,000 of us from his heart.
We are fortunate to have Frank Blake, another outstanding leader, as our new Chairman. We look forward to working closely with Frank as we build an even stronger and more durable franchise for the future.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Glen."

I would also like to start by thanking the Delta people for their perseverance through a challenging quarter. It is your hard work and dedication that sets Delta apart in our customers' eyes, and that translates into the revenue premium we realized for the industry.
As Ed mentioned, the biggest challenge we face as a company is the persistent decline of unit revenue. This quarter, our RASM was down 6.8%, including roughly one point of impact from the August outage and an additional point of headwind as we lapped the yen hedge gained from last year.
Excluding our outage, our unit revenues were at the bottom end of our initial guidance range and we attribute that shortfall primarily to 2 factors. First, the transatlantic proved more challenging than we expected given the supply demand imbalance in the region caused by multiple terrorist events, low-cost carrier growth and Brexit, which we are primarily seeing in the devaluation of the British pound.  Second, the domestic close-in yield environment was weaker than expected in the first half of the quarter, particularly in early August.
Overall domestic unit revenues declined 7% on 4% capacity growth in the September quarter, with nearly 2 points of the decline attributable to the August outage. While this result was weaker than we initially anticipated, we did see improvement as we went through the quarter, particularly as we lowered our capacity levels with our forced -- fall schedule in mid-August and adjusted some revenue management strategies. The improvement was most evident in September when domestic unit revenue declines moderated to 2.5% for the month, driven primarily by improving business revenues.
It is these trends that give us cautious optimism that we will have a path to positive RASM in the domestic entity in the December, January time frame; if not, shortly thereafter. To get there, we will slow our domestic capacity growth further in the fourth quarter to 2.5% year-over-year, which is less than half the rate we grew during the first 3 quarters of the year. We believe this lower capacity profile will position us to achieve a better RASM result during the upcoming off-peak season.
As I mentioned, we adjusted our revenue management strategies. As we have rolled out this new approach, we have seen close-in yields strengthen and we are working to build on this trend going forward. In September, over 1/3 of our domestic networks our RASM improved year-over-year, up from a low of 15% that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that percentage to exceed 50% over the next 90 days.
There are some calendar delays over the next few months, but we believe, on a combined basis, domestic RASM for November through January should be flattish as travel patterns shift between months due to holiday placements. And with domestic, the biggest driver of our overall system performance, this will be the major push we need to get our overall unit revenues back into positive territory.
Moving on to LatAm. I am pleased to say this is the first region to have turned the corner with a unit revenue improvement of 1.5% this quarter, the first time the LatAm entity has achieved a positive unit revenue in 2.5 years. After 16 consecutive quarters of negative results, Brazil unit revenues improved 30% year-on-year, with momentum building through the quarter as strengthening real drove more Brazil point-of-sale demand. We are seeing this positive trend continue as we head into the peak demand season.
Mexico business markets have also been a key driver on LatAm's path to positive RASM, achieving the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues. U.S. and Mexico Open Skies were ratified and took it back late August and we expect the U.S. DOT will grant antitrust immunity by year-end, paving the way for the implementation of our joint venture with Aeromexico. Delta's U.S.-Mexico scale will triple as a result of the partnership and allow us to build on the strong momentum we already have in the largest revenue market for U.S. travel to Latin America.
Regarding our 4Q '16 outlook, capacity in Latin America will remain flat as we continue to look to improve our RASM performance before growing further in the region.
Turning to the Pacific. In the September quarter, the region saw a positive RASM ex-hedge for the first time since 2013. Japan was a notable bright spot with RASM ex-hedge up 4% year-over-year spurred by a stronger yen. On the other hand, China continues to be challenged as industry capacity growth outpaced increases in demand.
Looking ahead, the industry supply demand imbalance in the Pacific will become more acute in the winter off-peak season, with industry capacity of 11% in the fourth quarter while demand is only up mid to high single digits.
We will also continue to face the headwinds as we lap last year's hedge gains. For the fourth quarter, it is a $30 million impact or about 0.5 points on system PRASM, which translates to nearly a 5 point drag on Pacific unit revenues.
While we were able to secure 2 daylight frequencies with the limiting opening of Haneda, it's forcing us to split our Tokyo operations between 2 airports, Haneda and Narita. As a result, we announced in August that we will be further restructuring the Narita hub with the winter schedule. The network changes will result in a 30% capacity reduction to and from Japan this winter and allow us to retire 2 additional 747s by the end of the year.
For the Pacific broadly, we will reduce our winter capacity by 9% to 10% as we continue to restructure our network for long-term profitability and sustainability in the region.
And finally, we get to the transatlantic. September quarter unit revenues were down 9.7% driven by overcapacity, particularly from LCCs and Middle East carriers, while terrorism concerns, sluggish economies and Brexit all lead on the demand set.
While the revenue environment was probably the most challenging, we also had a solidly profitable summer because of lower fuel. That said, as we go into the seasonally weaker period, we will reduce our capacity offering by 3 to 4 points starting in November to address the unit revenue challenges we are facing.
While we are expecting to take a bit longer to get to unit revenue growth in the transatlantic, we do expect that the pace of declines will moderate going forward. As we look out further, the transatlantic has some of the most unique competitive dynamics and we need to adopt our model to continue to leverage our existing joint ventures and seek new partners as we have done recently with Jet Airways, in addition to carefully managing our capacity in the region.
Now let me address our fourth quarter outlook. We expect system unit revenues to be down in the 3% to 5% range on a 1% capacity increase.
In closing, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the unit revenue trends we are starting to see significant portions of our network. And we expect that with a lot of hard work, we can continue to drive improvement and get to positive unit revenues by early next year. But as we have commented before, if we do not see the performance we expect as we move through the quarter, we will move quickly to make the changes we need to get the right outcome.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Thank you for joining us this morning.
Once again, this quarter, the Delta team was able to show, with our continued discipline on costs and focus on free cash flow, that we've built a solid foundation that has put us in a good position to weather the inevitable challenges we face in this business to deliver sustainable results.
Lower fuel prices drove a roughly $300 million decline in total operating expenses on a 1.5% increase in capacity. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat, including the 0.5 points impact of the outage. This result is consistent with our initial guidance as we continue to leverage the solid cost foundation we have built and deliver strong productivity savings, while we also continue to benefit from our upgauging initiatives.
We expect our nonfuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2% in the December quarter, which doesn't include any impact for a potential pilot agreement. This is slightly higher than our run rate from the past couple of quarters, but still comfortably below our 2% annual target as we're seeing some pressure from our lower capacity levels and timing of maintenance spend.
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $350 million or 18% year-over-year. We had no hedge impact during the current period given our decision to early settle our remaining 2016 positions during the June quarter.
The refinery lost $45 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations, driven by lower crack spreads. The hard work of our fuel team coupled with the expertise we have with the refinery has allowed us to harvest about a $0.03 per gallon unhedged fuel cost advantage over our competitors, and we are focused on widening that lead. This advantage will become even more important as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, with market fuel prices already higher year-over-year for the first time in over 2 years.
We expect an all-in December quarter fuel price of $1.60 to $1.65 per gallon, which is down for us year-over-year as we paid above-market rates during the same period in 2015, but higher on a market basis.
Now let me address our margin outlook. While we expect another quarter of solid cost performance giving a -- given a waning fuel tailwind and continued RASM headwinds, we are forecasting a December quarter operating margin in the 14% to 16% range, which is down roughly 2 points year-over-year. As Ed and Glen both mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment and, combined with our conservative capacity plans, reinforces our focus on maintaining our margin performance.
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We continued our balanced approach of deploying that cash with more than $650 million going back into the business as we took delivery of 11 mainline aircraft and our fleet modification projects continue. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect to spend an additional $520 million on the Aeromexico tender offer.
We ended the September quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, down roughly $400 million sequentially from June.
We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and returned $650 million to our shareholders during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash we have returned to our owners year-to-date to $2.7 billion, which already exceeds the level returned during all of 2015. We remain on track to meet our goal of returning at least 70% of our free cash flow this year to our owners.
In closing, I also want to express my gratitude to the Delta family for all of your hard work and perseverance during the quarter that allowed us to deliver cost performance that was consistent with our initial outlook despite the headwinds we experienced.

This morning, Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65. The resiliency of our business and our people stood out this quarter as we generated a solid 19% operating margin, $1.1 billion of free cash flow despite the weakest revenue environment in recent memory and the impact of the $150 million technology outage.
We apologize once more to those who were impacted by the outage and have already taken action to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their great efforts not only through the disruption, but also as we've worked to restore customers' confidence in Delta's reliability.
Even with the impact of the outage, we delivered solid operations with a 99% mainline completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 84% for the quarter. Importantly, of the 22 system-wide perfect completion factor days we had this quarter, what we call brand perfect days with both Delta and Delta Connection having perfect completion on all 5,500 daily flights, 21 of them came after the events in August. So the operation is back and running stronger than ever and our team proved once more why they are the very best.
I'm pleased to say we've added another $325 million towards next year's profit sharing for our employees, bringing the total so far this year to $920 million.
While the outage was a onetime event, the bigger challenge we face is from continued unit revenue declines, a trend that has persisted for the last 7 quarters. And while our strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to keep margins consistent with last year in the September quarter, market fuel prices look to be higher in the upcoming quarter for the first time in several years. Therefore, it continues to be a top priority for us to return to positive RASM in order to stabilize our margin performance and demonstrate the durability of the business model we have built.
Capacity is a significant lever we can use to impact that performance. And based on our RASM results earlier this year, we made the decision to lower our capacity growth to below 2% for the September quarter. And while the pace of improvement has been slower than we hoped, our unit revenues have started to move in the right direction with these lower capacity levels to which Glen will provide greater detail. That said, RASM remains negative and we'll stay conservative with our capacity, capping growth at 1% for the fourth quarter, a level of growth that we plan to carry over throughout 2017.
With this cautious approach, we can focus on firming the trends that have us on track for positive unit revenues, likely sometime early next year. This will go a long way towards demonstrating that Delta can sustain solid profits, margins and cash flows throughout the business cycle and provide further evidence that we have built a durable and sustainable model that warrants an improved valuation.
I want to thank the management and ALPA negotiating teams who worked tirelessly to get to the agreement in principle that we reached with our pilots 2 weeks ago. The potential agreement recognizes the important leadership role our pilots play in Delta's long-term success. It is now going through ALPA's approval and ratification process and, to respect that process, we're not going to comment any further than what I've just said.
Finally, in closing, I want to thank Richard for his leadership, his courage and his friendship to us all at Delta as he is now fully retired. Richard has been a transformative leader at Delta as well as for the industry. He is a true servant leader as he served all 80,000 of us from his heart.
We are fortunate to have Frank Blake, another outstanding leader, as our new Chairman. We look forward to working closely with Frank as we build an even stronger and more durable franchise for the future.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Glen."

I would also like to start by thanking the Delta people for their perseverance through a challenging quarter. It is your hard work and dedication that sets Delta apart in our customers' eyes, and that translates into the revenue premium we realized for the industry.
As Ed mentioned, the biggest challenge we face as a company is the persistent decline of unit revenue. This quarter, our RASM was down 6.8%, including roughly 1 point of impact from the August outage and an additional point of headwind as we lapped the yen hedge gain from last year.
Excluding our outage, our unit revenues were at the bottom end of our initial guidance range, and we attribute that shortfall primarily to 2 factors. First, the transatlantic proved more challenging than we expected given the supply/demand imbalance in the region caused by multiple terrorist events, low-cost carrier growth and Brexit, which we are primarily seeing in the devaluation of the British pound.  Second, the domestic close-in yield environment was weaker than expected in the first half of the quarter, particularly in early August.
Overall domestic unit revenues declined 7% on 4% capacity growth in the September quarter, with nearly 2 points of the decline attributable to the August outage. While this result was weaker than we initially anticipated, we did see improvement as we went through the quarter, particularly as we lowered our capacity levels with our forced -- fall schedule in mid-August and adjusted some revenue management strategies. The improvement was most evident in September when domestic unit revenue declines moderated to 2.5% for the month, driven primarily by improving business revenues.
It is these trends that give us cautious optimism that we will have a path to positive RASM in the domestic entity in the December, January time frame, if not shortly thereafter. To get there, we will slow our domestic capacity growth further in the fourth quarter to 2.5% year-over-year, which is less than half the rate we grew during the first 3 quarters of the year. We believe this lower capacity profile will position us to achieve a better RASM result during the upcoming off-peak season.
As I mentioned, we adjusted our revenue management strategies. As we have rolled out this new approach, we have seen close-in yields strengthen and we are working to build on this trend going forward. In September, over 1/3 of our domestic networks saw RASM improve year-over-year, up from a low of 15% that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that percentage to exceed 50% over the next 90 days.
There are some calendar delays [ph] over the next few months, but we believe, on a combined basis, domestic RASM for November through January should be flattish as travel patterns shift between months due to holiday placements. And with domestic, the biggest driver of our overall system performance, this will be the major push we need to get our overall unit revenues back into positive territory.
Moving on to LatAm. I am pleased to say this is the first region to have turned the corner with a unit revenue improvement of 1.5% this quarter, the first time the LatAm entity has achieved a positive unit revenue in 2.5 years. After 16 consecutive quarters of negative results, Brazil unit revenues improved 30% year-on-year, with momentum building through the quarter as a strengthening real drove more Brazil point-of-sale demand. We are seeing this positive trend continue as we head into the peak demand season.
Mexico business markets have also been a key driver on LatAm's path to positive RASM, achieving the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues. U.S. and Mexico Open Skies were ratified and took effect late August, and we expect the U.S. DOT will grant antitrust immunity by year-end, paving the way for the implementation of our joint venture with Aeromexico. Delta's U.S.-Mexico scale will triple as a result of the partnership and allow us to build on the strong momentum we already have in the largest revenue market for U.S. travel to Latin America.
Regarding our 4Q '16 outlook, capacity in Latin America will remain flat as we continue to look to improve our RASM performance before growing further in the region.
Turning to the Pacific. In the September quarter, the region saw a positive RASM ex hedge for the first time since 2013. Japan was a notable bright spot, with RASM ex hedge up 4% year-over-year spurred by a stronger yen. On the other hand, China continues to be challenged as industry capacity growth outpaced increases in demand.
Looking ahead, the industry supply/demand imbalance in the Pacific will become more acute in the winter off-peak season, with industry capacity up 11% in the fourth quarter while demand is only up mid to high single digits.
We will also continue to face the headwinds as we lap last year's hedge gains. For the fourth quarter, it is a $30 million impact or about 0.5 points on system PRASM, which translates to nearly a 5 point drag on Pacific unit revenues.
While we were able to secure 2 daylight frequencies with the limiting opening of Haneda, it's forcing us to split our Tokyo operations between 2 airports, Haneda and Narita. As a result, we announced in August that we will be further restructuring the Narita hub with the winter schedule. The network changes will result in a 30% capacity reduction to and from Japan this winter and allow us to retire 2 additional 747s by the end of the year.
For the Pacific broadly, we will reduce our winter capacity by 9% to 10% as we continue to restructure our network for long-term profitability and sustainability in the region.
And finally, we get to the transatlantic. September quarter unit revenues were down 9.7% driven by overcapacity, particularly from LCCs and Middle East carriers, while terrorism concerns, sluggish economies and Brexit all weighed on the demand set.
While the revenue environment was probably the most challenging, we also had a solidly profitable summer because of lower fuel. That said, as we go into the seasonally weaker period, we will reduce our capacity offering by 3 to 4 points starting in November to address the unit revenue challenges we are facing.
While we are expecting to take a bit longer to get to unit revenue growth in the transatlantic, we do expect that the pace of declines will moderate going forward. As we look out further, the transatlantic has some of the most unique competitive dynamics and we need to adopt [ph] our model to continue to leverage our existing joint ventures and seek new partners as we have done recently with Jet Airways, in addition to carefully managing our capacity in the region.
Now let me address our fourth quarter outlook. We expect system unit revenues to be down in the 3% to 5% range on a 1% capacity increase.
In closing, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the unit revenue trends we are starting to see in significant portions of our network. And we expect that with a lot of hard work, we can continue to drive improvement and get to positive unit revenues by early next year. But as we have commented before, if we do not see the performance we expect as we move through the quarter, we will move quickly to make the changes we need to get the right outcome.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Thank you for joining us this morning.
Once again, this quarter, the Delta team was able to show, with our continued discipline on costs and focus on free cash flow, that we've built a solid foundation that has put us in a good position to weather the inevitable challenges we face in this business to deliver sustainable results.
Lower fuel prices drove a roughly $300 million decline in total operating expenses on a 1.5% increase in capacity. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat, including the 0.5 points impact of the outage. This result is consistent with our initial guidance as we continue to leverage the solid cost foundation we have built and deliver strong productivity savings while we also continue to benefit from our upgauging initiatives.
We expect our nonfuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2% in the December quarter, which doesn't include any impact for a potential pilot agreement. This is slightly higher than our run rate from the past couple of quarters, but still comfortably below our 2% annual target as we're seeing some pressure from our lower capacity levels and timing of maintenance spend.
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $350 million or 18% year-over-year. We had no hedge impact during the current period given our decision to early settle our remaining 2016 positions during the June quarter.
The refinery lost $45 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations, driven by lower crack spreads. The hard work of our fuel team coupled with the expertise we have with the refinery has allowed us to harvest about a $0.03 per gallon unhedged fuel cost advantage over our competitors, and we are focused on widening that lead. This advantage will become even more important as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, with market fuel prices already higher year-over-year for the first time in over 2 years.
We expect an all-in December quarter fuel price of $1.60 to $1.65 per gallon, which is down for us year-over-year as we paid above-market rates during the same period in 2015, but higher on a market basis.
Now let me address our margin outlook. While we expect another quarter of solid cost performance giving a -- given a waning fuel tailwind and continued RASM headwinds, we are forecasting a December quarter operating margin in the 14% to 16% range, which is down roughly 2 points year-over-year. As Ed and Glen both mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment and, combined with our conservative capacity plans, reinforces our focus on maintaining our margin performance.
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We continued our balanced approach of deploying that cash with more than $650 million going back into the business as we took delivery of 11 mainline aircraft and our fleet modification projects continue. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect to spend an additional $520 million on the Aeromexico tender offer.
We ended the September quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, down roughly $400 million sequentially from June.
We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and returned $650 million to our shareholders during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash we have returned to our owners year-to-date to $2.7 billion, which already exceeds the level returned during all of 2015. We remain on track to meet our goal of returning at least 70% of our free cash flow this year to our owners.
In closing, I also want to express my gratitude to the Delta family for all of your hard work and perseverance during the quarter that allowed us to deliver cost performance that was consistent with our initial outlook despite the headwinds we experienced. I am confident that our efforts will allow us to continue to deliver sustainable results regardless of the challenges we face. Jill?"

I appreciate you joining us.This morning, Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65.

This morning, Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65. The resiliency of our business and our people stood out this quarter as we generated a solid 19% operating margin, $1.1 billion of free cash flow despite the weakest revenue environment in recent memory and the impact of the $150 million technology outage.
We apologize once more to those who were impacted by the outage and have already taken action to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their great efforts not only through the disruption, but also as we've worked to restore customers' confidence in Delta's reliability.
Even with the impact of the outage, we delivered solid operations with a 99% mainline completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 84% for the quarter. Importantly, of the 22 system-wide perfect completion factor days we had this quarter, what we call brand perfect days with both Delta and Delta Connection having perfect completion on all 5,500 daily flights, 21 of them came after the events in August. So the operation is back and running stronger than ever and our team proved once more why they are the very best.
I'm pleased to say we've added another $325 million towards next year's profit sharing for our employees, bringing the total so far this year to $920 million.
While the outage was a onetime event, the bigger challenge we face is from continued unit revenue declines, a trend that has persisted for the last 7 quarters. And while our strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to keep margins consistent with last year in the September quarter, market fuel prices look to be higher in the upcoming quarter for the first time in several years. Therefore, it continues to be a top priority for us to return to positive RASM in order to stabilize our margin performance and demonstrate the durability of the business model we have built.
Capacity is a significant lever we can use to impact that performance. And based on our RASM results earlier this year, we made the decision to lower our capacity growth to below 2% for the September quarter. And while the pace of improvement has been slower than we hoped, our unit revenues have started to move in the right direction with these lower capacity levels to which Glen will provide greater detail. That said, RASM remains negative and we'll stay conservative with our capacity, capping growth at 1% for the fourth quarter, a level of growth that we plan to carry over throughout 2017.
With this cautious approach, we can focus on firming the trends that have us on track for positive unit revenues, likely sometime early next year. This will go a long way towards demonstrating that Delta can sustain solid profits, margins and cash flows throughout the business cycle and provide further evidence that we have built a durable and sustainable model that warrants an improved valuation.
I want to thank the management and ALPA negotiating teams who worked tirelessly to get to the agreement in principle that we reached with our pilots 2 weeks ago. The potential agreement recognizes the important leadership role our pilots play in Delta's long-term success. It is now going through ALPA's approval and ratification process and, to respect that process, we're not going to comment any further than what I've just said.
Finally, in closing, I want to thank Richard for his leadership, his courage and his friendship to us all at Delta as he is now fully retired. Richard has been a transformative leader at Delta as well as for the industry. He is a true servant leader as he served all 80,000 of us from his heart.
We are fortunate to have Frank Blake, another outstanding leader, as our new Chairman. We look forward to working closely with Frank as we build an even stronger and more durable franchise for the future.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Glen."

I would also like to start by thanking the Delta people for their perseverance through a challenging quarter. It is your hard work and dedication that sets Delta apart in our customers' eyes, and that translates into the revenue premium we realized for the industry.
As Ed mentioned, the biggest challenge we face as a company is the persistent decline of unit revenue. This quarter, our RASM was down 6.8%, including roughly 1 point of impact from the August outage and an additional point of headwind as we lapped the yen hedge gain from last year.
Excluding our outage, our unit revenues were at the bottom end of our initial guidance range, and we attribute that shortfall primarily to 2 factors. First, the transatlantic proved more challenging than we expected given the supply/demand imbalance in the region caused by multiple terrorist events, low-cost carrier growth and Brexit, which we are primarily seeing in the devaluation of the British pound.  Second, the domestic close-in yield environment was weaker than expected in the first half of the quarter, particularly in early August.
Overall domestic unit revenues declined 7% on 4% capacity growth in the September quarter, with nearly 2 points of the decline attributable to the August outage. While this result was weaker than we initially anticipated, we did see improvement as we went through the quarter, particularly as we lowered our capacity levels with our forced -- fall schedule in mid-August and adjusted some revenue management strategies. The improvement was most evident in September when domestic unit revenue declines moderated to 2.5% for the month, driven primarily by improving business revenues.
It is these trends that give us cautious optimism that we will have a path to positive RASM in the domestic entity in the December, January time frame, if not shortly thereafter. To get there, we will slow our domestic capacity growth further in the fourth quarter to 2.5% year-over-year, which is less than half the rate we grew during the first 3 quarters of the year. We believe this lower capacity profile will position us to achieve a better RASM result during the upcoming off-peak season.
As I mentioned, we adjusted our revenue management strategies. As we have rolled out this new approach, we have seen close-in yields strengthen and we are working to build on this trend going forward. In September, over 1/3 of our domestic networks saw RASM improve year-over-year, up from a low of 15% that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that percentage to exceed 50% over the next 90 days.
There are some calendar delays [ph] over the next few months, but we believe, on a combined basis, domestic RASM for November through January should be flattish as travel patterns shift between months due to holiday placements. And with domestic, the biggest driver of our overall system performance, this will be the major push we need to get our overall unit revenues back into positive territory.
Moving on to LatAm. I am pleased to say this is the first region to have turned the corner with a unit revenue improvement of 1.5% this quarter, the first time the LatAm entity has achieved a positive unit revenue in 2.5 years. After 16 consecutive quarters of negative results, Brazil unit revenues improved 30% year-on-year, with momentum building through the quarter as a strengthening real drove more Brazil point-of-sale demand. We are seeing this positive trend continue as we head into the peak demand season.
Mexico business markets have also been a key driver on LatAm's path to positive RASM, achieving the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues. U.S. and Mexico Open Skies were ratified and took effect late August, and we expect the U.S. DOT will grant antitrust immunity by year-end, paving the way for the implementation of our joint venture with Aeromexico. Delta's U.S.-Mexico scale will triple as a result of the partnership and allow us to build on the strong momentum we already have in the largest revenue market for U.S. travel to Latin America.
Regarding our 4Q '16 outlook, capacity in Latin America will remain flat as we continue to look to improve our RASM performance before growing further in the region.
Turning to the Pacific. In the September quarter, the region saw a positive RASM ex hedge for the first time since 2013. Japan was a notable bright spot, with RASM ex hedge up 4% year-over-year spurred by a stronger yen. On the other hand, China continues to be challenged as industry capacity growth outpaced increases in demand.
Looking ahead, the industry supply/demand imbalance in the Pacific will become more acute in the winter off-peak season, with industry capacity up 11% in the fourth quarter while demand is only up mid to high single digits.
We will also continue to face the headwinds as we lap last year's hedge gains. For the fourth quarter, it is a $30 million impact or about 0.5 points on system PRASM, which translates to nearly a 5 point drag on Pacific unit revenues.
While we were able to secure 2 daylight frequencies with the limiting opening of Haneda, it's forcing us to split our Tokyo operations between 2 airports, Haneda and Narita. As a result, we announced in August that we will be further restructuring the Narita hub with the winter schedule. The network changes will result in a 30% capacity reduction to and from Japan this winter and allow us to retire 2 additional 747s by the end of the year.
For the Pacific broadly, we will reduce our winter capacity by 9% to 10% as we continue to restructure our network for long-term profitability and sustainability in the region.
And finally, we get to the transatlantic. September quarter unit revenues were down 9.7% driven by overcapacity, particularly from LCCs and Middle East carriers, while terrorism concerns, sluggish economies and Brexit all weighed on the demand set.
While the revenue environment was probably the most challenging, we also had a solidly profitable summer because of lower fuel. That said, as we go into the seasonally weaker period, we will reduce our capacity offering by 3 to 4 points starting in November to address the unit revenue challenges we are facing.
While we are expecting to take a bit longer to get to unit revenue growth in the transatlantic, we do expect that the pace of declines will moderate going forward. As we look out further, the transatlantic has some of the most unique competitive dynamics and we need to adopt [ph] our model to continue to leverage our existing joint ventures and seek new partners as we have done recently with Jet Airways, in addition to carefully managing our capacity in the region.
Now let me address our fourth quarter outlook. We expect system unit revenues to be down in the 3% to 5% range on a 1% capacity increase.
In closing, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the unit revenue trends we are starting to see in significant portions of our network. And we expect that with a lot of hard work, we can continue to drive improvement and get to positive unit revenues by early next year. But as we have commented before, if we do not see the performance we expect as we move through the quarter, we will move quickly to make the changes we need to get the right outcome.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Thank you for joining us this morning.
Once again, this quarter, the Delta team was able to show, with our continued discipline on costs and focus on free cash flow, that we've built a solid foundation that has put us in a good position to weather the inevitable challenges we face in this business to deliver sustainable results.
Lower fuel prices drove a roughly $300 million decline in total operating expenses on a 1.5% increase in capacity. Nonfuel CASM was essentially flat, including the 0.5 points impact of the outage. This result is consistent with our initial guidance as we continue to leverage the solid cost foundation we have built and deliver strong productivity savings while we also continue to benefit from our upgauging initiatives.
We expect our nonfuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2% in the December quarter, which doesn't include any impact for a potential pilot agreement. This is slightly higher than our run rate from the past couple of quarters, but still comfortably below our 2% annual target as we're seeing some pressure from our lower capacity levels and timing of maintenance spend.
Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $350 million or 18% year-over-year. We had no hedge impact during the current period given our decision to early settle our remaining 2016 positions during the June quarter.
The refinery lost $45 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations, driven by lower crack spreads. The hard work of our fuel team coupled with the expertise we have with the refinery has allowed us to harvest about a $0.03 per gallon unhedged fuel cost advantage over our competitors, and we are focused on widening that lead. This advantage will become even more important as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, with market fuel prices already higher year-over-year for the first time in over 2 years.
We expect an all-in December quarter fuel price of $1.60 to $1.65 per gallon, which is down for us year-over-year as we paid above-market rates during the same period in 2015, but higher on a market basis.
Now let me address our margin outlook. While we expect another quarter of solid cost performance giving a -- given a waning fuel tailwind and continued RASM headwinds, we are forecasting a December quarter operating margin in the 14% to 16% range, which is down roughly 2 points year-over-year. As Ed and Glen both mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment and, combined with our conservative capacity plans, reinforces our focus on maintaining our margin performance.
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We continued our balanced approach of deploying that cash with more than $650 million going back into the business as we took delivery of 11 mainline aircraft and our fleet modification projects continue. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect to spend an additional $520 million on the Aeromexico tender offer.
We ended the September quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, down roughly $400 million sequentially from June.
We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and returned $650 million to our shareholders during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash we have returned to our owners year-to-date to $2.7 billion, which already exceeds the level returned during all of 2015. We remain on track to meet our goal of returning at least 70% of our free cash flow this year to our owners.
In closing, I also want to express my gratitude to the Delta family for all of your hard work and perseverance during the quarter that allowed us to deliver cost performance that was consistent with our initial outlook despite the headwinds we experienced. I am confident that our efforts will allow us to continue to deliver sustainable results regardless of the challenges we face. Jill?"
