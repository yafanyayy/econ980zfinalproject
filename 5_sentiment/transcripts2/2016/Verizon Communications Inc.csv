As a reminder, our earnings release, fin",516,"Thanks, Carlos. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran those are our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I'd like to highlight. Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pretax $3.2 billion credit, which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily noncash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pretax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these 2 items amount to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrated basis, if we assumed 100% wireless ownership fall of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year. As a reminder, included in our Wireline results of the operations from the 3 states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognize the benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior-period results do not include AOL. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our three-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms and video an",3924,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our three-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms and video and Internet of Things and creating certain opportunities and applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital first mobile world in 2016 and beyond. 
As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic, competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1%, and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders. 
Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability, with sequential improvements in postpaid gross and net adds as well as net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight, with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total Wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year and our EBITDA margin expanded. 
Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduce costs. Overall, our full year Wireline segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points. 
We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things as well as prepositioning us for the future of 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 Spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion. 
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain Wireline properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers, and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends. As we disclosed in September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows. 
We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame, so overall, a strong, balanced 2015, which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future. 
Now let's get into fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2%, including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL's performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers. For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparatable full year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower Wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades and a less-than-projected take-rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter. 
Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in Wireless and FiOS. The change in the Wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to Wireless equipment volumes. We continue to manage through the transition to the device installment model. 
We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes n improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies have enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments. 
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. Free cash flow for the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $18.8 billion. We've been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continue to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources. 
Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion and a ratio of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% from the fourth quarter and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as activation rate for device payment plans increases. 
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take-rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9% and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience starting with the network, simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with a sequential improvement in the number 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base. Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 68% [ph] over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago. 
We continue to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our Spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer. 
Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. 
Let's move next our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and Mass Markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass Markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in Mass Markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year. The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers rightsize their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for Fios Broadband only is also increasing while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having a choice in selecting linear video packages. 
We had another quarter with Custom TV, representing about 1/3 of our Fios Video sales. In the fourth quarter, FiOS total revenue grew 6.8%, with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the Internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds. As I highlighted earlier, FiOS Internet subscriber growth remains strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year and now have a total of 7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter. 
In linear video, we are seeing strong market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year and now have a total of 5.8 million Fios Video subscribers, which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.3% and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, Global Enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4% to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016. 
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year. As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. 
As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level, and we'll report more details post transaction. Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the Wireline segment. 
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our three-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic, competitive environment as we work through the transition of our Wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparatable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continue to grow at double-digit rates even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends. As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016, we are confident in our three-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results to date through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appeal to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets. At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets and future spectrum bands that can be made available. 
Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year. Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in Wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities for Global AdTech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally, and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL's global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens. We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the Wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which uses our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter. We are encouraged by the use of Go90 not only on the Verizon network but also the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform. 
Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee Data, Verizon Wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free off data chargers, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past 2 quarters, we are offering Custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our FiOS TV offerings to take advantage of the secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend. 
We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experienced in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, Hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our connected city strategy beginning with Savanna and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThinkSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenues and streams from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%. 
Let's move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both Wireless and FiOS and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018, 2019 time frame. As previously stated, Verizon expects full year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparatable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction and the ramping up new business models in video and Internet of Things. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full year 2015 performance; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion. This includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier; and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So on earnings per share, yes, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level and comparatable to 2015 adjusted earnings.

So on earnings per share, yes, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level and comparatable to 2015 adjusted earnings. And the way to think about this is, we ended 2015 at $3.99. There's $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale. So that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about the plateauing, we are referring to the $3.99. So when you think about this, you're going from $3.86 from a jumpoff point to $3.99. So the way think about it is, we're actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that onetime adjustment. So we will grow through the benefit of the depreciation this year. Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just Math moving the Wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model. And of course, the ramping up our new businesses, which have been very clear in the beginning, these are like start of businesses. And most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in beginning until you can grow the customer bases and they start to generate the profitability. Moving into the bonus depreciation, yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year. But I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our tax, cash tax payments will decrease in '16. They will actually increase even with this benefit. And the piece of that is because the profitability from a pretax income perspective will continue to increase, and we're also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations. So from a cash tax perspective, you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now not to the extent of the 35 to 36 guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in '15 to the upper 20% in '16. On the cord shaving piece, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into FiOS on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending, but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point. So David, hopefully, that answers your question. Let's move to the next one."

But we will participate in the auction, and I'll leave it at that. But thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I've talked about previously and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead of 5G. As we said, we'll be at the forefront, and we are currently at the forefront globally, talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we're currently preparing for those field trials. The other thing I would say about 5G is, we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. And think about 5G, it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other case. It's not just about mobility. And then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied Consumer Electronics Show this past 2 weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who are running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi. And it's absolutely shows no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there, and it actually showed that the comparatability is it improves the WiFi performance by having it managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the SEC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers. And then, of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps, which we just completed this past quarter. We're working on another swap that we'll complete in the first quarter. And also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that's how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective. On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually reinstated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers as an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers. Is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon? There's no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory. And as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we'll execute on the transaction. If it doesn't, then we won't. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you, Simon."

Thanks, John. So on the churn rate, if you recall when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said the concentration of 2015 will be to protect our customer base, and that's exactly what we executed on throughout 2015 and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us. And I think that's proven to our very low churn rate this fourth quarter even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they're stealing customers. The churn rate does not group that, and port outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers, so they understand what they're getting, and this goes to our loyalty base. On the service revenue side, I guess, the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to mass, mass of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model where you get a break in service revenue, but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We're slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing so you've already seen the impact of that. As I said the last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will obtain mid-year. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take-rate of installment sale, but we do believe that, that take-rate will accelerate backup of 70% for the fourth quarter, and we're going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that we'll drive some of that behavior towards that. As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take devices -- the device payment or subsidy. And what we saw in the fourth quarter was, we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of Wireless because of the subsidy take. So having said that, John, I think that as we go through the year, we'll be able to give you more clarity here. But the other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the IR metric, which if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and the fourth quarter went up 0.9%. So you're already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I'll leave it at that for '16, but I'll come back to you as we break through the 50%."

So the answer to the question is, yes, absolutely. And I think we have to go back and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story.

And I think we have to go back and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. 92% of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled. The other 8% are microwave, which probably won't get fiber. So if you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber-enabled. And every small cell, 100% of every small cell with the point is fiber-backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marni has under IoT, Go90, but also for 5G. If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they're willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this. So when you look at Wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down by 1.9 million. So if you just do the backwards math on that, that's an excess of $1 billion of revenue that wasn't there this year that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon Wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon Wireless revenue streams. On the Wireline, FiOS is still the foundation. It's now 80% of the overall Wireline revenue. When you look at what we're doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and down loads, so that's something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I've said, yes, it has a limited life but you're going to see us refresh Custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is what they -- they want choice. They don't want to have the paper bundles that they never use. And then, of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this. Then you jump in to our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016. Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we've seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million. But the key to us is not the downloads, the key is viewership and it's around content. And we will continue to add content that's favorable to all generations of population. Obviously, we have a lot of content there for millennials, both sports and music attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we're attacking all viewership with this product and we'll have more to say about that probably mid-year. Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it's all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our smart cities, telematics. With the launch of Hum, we started that in the fourth quarter, and we've already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can keep the product within Verizon Wireless continually selling out of the product and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThinkSpace, this is really the adjuncts the Consumer Electronics Show where we've opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that's just since October 29 of this year. So yes, it was a transition year in '15, it will be a transition year in '16. But I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking that we will absolutely be our GDP-growth company post 2016. Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. So thanks, Phil."

But 40% of our customers to fulfill their subsidy contract have moved over to the pricing. So they're getting the discount, so we're absorbing that. And as I said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur. And we're already starting to see some of that in the IARPA-type metric. So it's hard for me to contact the second what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is that 50%, you start to see an inflection point. We'll talk more about that as we go through the quarters. As far as towers go, look, I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, the antenna system in building. But keep in mind that each of those small cells in building and antenna systems all gets fiber back to a main macro cell. So the macro cell still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that's at a much lower rate, but the importance of the tower is still there."

You had a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continue to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn't have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago. So that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. So the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn't what it was a year ago. And if you remember I said coming into this back, way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in the similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year. But if you go back to the previous years, I think you'll see similar lower-volume years and then you have iconic devices come out and then it stimulates some usage case there.

So on the cost cutting, look, I think the last 3 to 4 years, we've talked about this and we're an extremely disciplined corporation as far as cost go. With the launch of Verizon Lean Six Sigma program 3 years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there's a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There's a lot of progress being made within our logistics system. I mean, this year alone, we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the Wireless restructure this year was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon Wireless. So as we go into '16, you saw us take the severance charge, and I would tell you most of the severance charge was related to headcount that is already completed in the fourth quarter. So entering the 2016, we continue on the paht that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there's still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure. And if you look at Wireline, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of Wireline. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that. As far as overall economics, I'm not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at what everybody else looks at, and we'll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I'm certainly not going to predict any negativism there."

Thanks, Craig. So when I think about the whole portfolio of Go90, Verizon Digital Media Services and AOL, obviously, we just launched all these products, so there's a start-up with the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You're going to see that continue through the 4 quarters of '16, which was not there in '15. So there will be pressure from these start-up companies. What learnings on Go90 are very simple. We're looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in 1 day, and we're starting to see from positive there, where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that's important because that's what's viable to the advertising community. So the whole basis here is, we have to ramp viewership. I would tell you, internally, we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for '16 because we needed to build a viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you're seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Another there is seasonality to that. But as I mentioned, I'm looking for them to grow substantially in 2016. So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we're looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not, especially Go90 will not be a profitable product probably within 1- to 2-year Verizon rate now. When we launched it, we said 2 to 3, but that's probably up 2 years before that will become a top contributor to the enterprise. But it will certainly build on the top line perspective. But right now, we're focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product. So I'll stop there. As I said, we will come in with much more detail probably mid-year and start to give you some viewership into exactly some of the results of Go90 and AOL."

But we will be looking at potential public markets as well as private markets, but we will stay with the securitization model as well. So we're just looking at very different alternatives to support the program going forward because we do believe it will continue to grow in 2016. And more to say on that when we come to a conclusion on that one, Amir."

If you look at some of the small cell technology and also some of the technology that can be utilized at the cell sites, I know there's a fancy name for it but I'm at the engineered here, but it gives you the capability to be able to tilt the antennas and turn the antennas to where the capacity is. So if you think about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming. Obviously, when we launched 4G, we said it would be 4 to 5x more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we're going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G. So yes, I think that if you look at Spectrum, we are in a very, very good Spectrum holdings as we said with all my other comments around Spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with that when we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G. So utilizing all of these items, we feel that we are in very, very good shape from a capacity standpoint."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in the Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I'd like to highlight. Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pretax $3.2 billion credit, which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily noncash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pretax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these 2 items amount to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share.
Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis, if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year.
As a reminder, included in our Wireline results were the operations from the 3 states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized the benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior-period results do not include AOL.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms, in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond.
As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic, competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1%, and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders.
Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid gross and net adds as well as net phone additions.
Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total Wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year, and our EBITDA margin expanded.
Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year Wireline segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points.
We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things as well as prepositioning us for the future of 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion.
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain Wireline properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers, and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends. As we disclosed in September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.
We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. So overall, a strong, balanced 2015, which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future.
Now let's get into fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2%, including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL's performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers.
For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparatable full year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less-than-projected take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter.
Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in Wireless and FiOS. The change in the Wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to Wireless equipment volumes. We continue to manage through the transition to the device installment model.
We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. Free cash flow for the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $18.8 billion. We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources.
Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion and a ratio of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% from the fourth quarter and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base move to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. 
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. 
During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points.
We are very focused on improving the customer experience starting with the network, simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base.
Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago.
We continue to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer.
Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year. The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers rightsize their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for FiOS Broadband-only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having the choice in selecting linear video packages.
We had another quarter with Custom TV, representing about 1/3 of our FiOS video sales.
In the fourth quarter, FiOS total revenue grew 6.8%, with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the Internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we had shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds. As I highlighted earlier, FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year and now have a total of 7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter.
In linear video, we are seeing strong market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3% and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4% to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016.
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year.
As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings dependent on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level, and we'll report more details post transaction.
Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the Wireline segment.
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our 3-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic, competitive environment as we work through the transition of our Wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparatable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continue to grow at a double-digit rate even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year, excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends.
As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results to date through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appeal to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets. At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets and future spectrum bands that can be made available.
Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year.
Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in Wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities to the global ad tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally, and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL's global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens. We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the Wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which uses our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter. We are encouraged by the use of Go90, not only on the Verizon network but also the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform.
Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee Data, Verizon Wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past 2 quarters, we are offering Custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our FiOS TV offerings to take advantage of the secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend.
We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our connected city strategy beginning with Savannah and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThinkSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%.
Let's move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both Wireless and FiOS and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018, 2019 time frame.
As previously stated, Verizon expects full year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparatable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things.
Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full year 2015 performance. Consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion. This includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier. And a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

And then second, obviously, we had an extension of bonus tax depreciation last year. It's been something you've been benefiting from. Could you kind of scope the size of the benefit you're going to get this year? And if I could just one last one.

So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparatable to 2015 adjusted earnings. And the way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. T",440,"Thanks, David. So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparatable to 2015 adjusted earnings. And the way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There is $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale. So that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about plateauing, we're referring to the $3.99. So when you think about this, you're going from $3.86 from a jumpoff point to $3.99. So the way I think about it is we're actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that onetime adjustment. So we will grow through the benefit of the depreciation this year. Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math moving the Wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model. And of course, the ramping of our new businesses, which, I've been very clear in the beginning, these are like start-up businesses. And in most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and they start to generate the profitability. Moving into the bonus depreciation. Yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year. But I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our tax -- cash tax payments will decrease in '16. They will actually increase even with this benefit. And the piece of that is because the profitability from a pretax income perspective will continue to increase, and we're also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations. So from a cash tax perspective, you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now not to the extent of the 35% to 36% guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in '15 to the upper 20% in '16. On the cord shaving piece, as I -- we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into FiOS on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point. So David, hopefully, that answers your question. Let's move to the next one."

So on the auction, let's just -- I'll keep this one short on the incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can't say at this point. But we will participate in the auction, and I'll leave it at that. But thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I've talked about previously, and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead of 5G. As we said, we'll be at the forefront, and we are currently at the forefront globally, talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we're currently preparing for those field trials. The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. And think about 5G, it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other U-cases [ph], not just about mobility. And then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied Consumer Electronics Show this past 2 weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi. And it absolutely shows no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there, and it actually showed that the comparatability is it improves the WiFi performance by having the managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the SEC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers. And then, of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps, which we just completed this past quarter. We're working on another swap that we will complete in the first quarter. And also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that's how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective. On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers. Is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon? There's no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory. And as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we'll execute on the transaction. If it doesn't, then we won't. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you, Simon."

Thanks, John. So on the churn rate, if you recall, when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said the concentration of '15 will be to protect our customer base, and that's exactly what we executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us. And I think that's proven to our very lower churn rate this fourth quarter. Even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they're stealing customers, the churn rate does not reflect that. And port-outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers so they understand what they're getting, and this goes to our loyalty base. On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to mask, mask of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model where you get a break in service revenue, but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We're slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing, so you've already seen the impact of that. As I said the last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will obtain mid-year. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe that, that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter. And we're going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that. As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take devices -- the device payment or subsidy. And what we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of Wireless because of the subsidy take. So having said that, John, I think that as we go through the year, we'll be able to give you more clarity here. But the other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the IARPA metric, which, if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and in the fourth quarter went up 0.9%. So you're already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I'll leave it at that for '16, but I'll come back to you as we break through the 50%."

So the answer to the question is, yes, absolutely. And I think we have to go back to -- and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story.

And I think we have to go back to -- and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. 92% of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled. The other 8% are microwave, which probably won't get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber-enabled. And every small cell, 100% of every small cell we deployed is fiber-backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marni has under IoT, Go90, but also for 5G. If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they are willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this. So when you look at Wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down by 1.9 million. So if you just do the backwards math on that, that's an excess of $1 billion of revenue that wasn't there this year that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon Wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon Wireless revenue streams. On Wireline, FiOS is still the foundation. It's now 80% of the overall Wireline revenue. When you look at what we are doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads, so that's something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I've said, yes, it has a limited life, but you're going to see us refresh Custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is what -- they want choice. They don't want to have the paper bundles that they never use. And then, of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this. Then you jump in to our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016. Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we've seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads, the key is viewership, and it's around content. And we will continue to add content that's favorable to all generations of population. Obviously, we have a lot of content there for millennials, both sports and music, attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we're attacking all viewership with this product, and we'll have more to say about that probably mid-year. Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it's all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our smart cities, telematics, with the launch of hum. We started that in the fourth quarter, and we've already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can't keep the product within Verizon Wireless. They're continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThinkSpace, this is really the adjunct to Consumer Electronics Show where we've opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that's just since October 29 of this year. So yes, it was a transition year in '15, it will be a transition year in '16. But I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking that we will absolutely be a GDP-growth company post 2016. Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. So thanks, Phil."

But 40% of our customers who fulfill their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing. So they're getting the discount, so we're absorbing that. And as I said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur. And you're also already starting to see some of that in the IARPA-type metric. So it's hard for me to forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is that 50%, you start to see an inflection point. We'll talk more about that as we go through the quarters. As far as towers go, look, I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, diversified antenna systems in-building. But keep in mind that each of those small cells in-building and antenna systems all gets fiber back to a main macro cell. So the macro cells still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that's at a much slower rate, but the importance of the tower is still there."

You had a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continued to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn't have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago. So that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. So the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn't what it was a year ago. And if you remember, I said, coming into this back -- way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in the similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year. But if you go back to the previous years, I think you'll see similar lower-volume years, and then you have iconic devices come out and then it stimulates some usage case there. So for '16, it's too early to tell yet, but I would think that we'll see similar trends that we did in '15."

So on the cost cutting, look, I think the last 3 to 4 years, we've talked about this, and we're an extremely disciplined corporation as far as costs go. With the launch of Verizon Lean Six Sigma program 3 years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there's a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There's a lot of progress being made within our logistics system. I mean, this year alone, we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the Wireless restructure this year was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon Wireless. So as we go into '16, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you, most of that severance charge was related to headcount that was -- is already completed in the fourth quarter. So entering into 2016, we continue on the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there's still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure. And if you look at Wireline, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of Wireline. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that. As far as overall economics, I'm not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at what everybody else looks at, and we'll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I'm certainly not going to predict any negativism there."

So when I think about the whole portfolio of Go90, Verizon Digital Media Services and AOL, obviously, we just launched all these products, so there's a start-up. It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You're going to see that continue through the 4 quarters of '16, which was not there in '15. So there will be pressure from these start-up companies. Well, our learnings on Go90 are very simple. We're looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in 1 day, and we're starting to see some positive there, where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that's important because that's what's viable to the advertising community. So the whole basis here is we have to ramp viewership. I will tell you, internally, we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for '16 because we needed to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you're seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now there is seasonality to that. But as I mentioned, I'm looking at for them to grow substantially in 2016. So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we're looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not -- especially Go90, will not be a profitable product probably within a 1- to 2-year horizon rate now. When we launched it, we said 2 to 3, but that's probably up 2 years before that will become a top profit contributor to the enterprise. But it will certainly build on the top line perspective. But right now, we're focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product. So I'll stop there. We -- as I said, we will come in with much more detail probably mid-year and start to give you some viewership into exactly some of the results of Go90 and AOL."

So if you think about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming. Obviously, when we launched 4G, we said it would be 4 to 5x more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we're going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G. So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holdings as we said with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with that when we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in the Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I'd like to highlight. Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pretax $3.2 billion credit, which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily noncash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pretax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these 2 items amount to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share.
Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis, if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year.
As a reminder, included in our Wireline results were the operations from the 3 states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized the benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior-period results do not include AOL.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms, in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond.
As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic, competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1%, and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders.
Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid gross and net adds as well as net phone additions.
Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total Wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year, and our EBITDA margin expanded.
Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year Wireline segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points.
We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things as well as prepositioning us for the future of 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion.
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain Wireline properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers, and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends. As we disclosed in September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.
We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. So overall, a strong, balanced 2015, which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future.
Now let's get into fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2%, including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL's performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers.
For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparable full year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less-than-projected take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter.
Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in Wireless and FiOS. The change in the Wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to Wireless equipment volumes. We continue to manage through the transition to the device installment model.
We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. Free cash flow for the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $18.8 billion. We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources.
Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion and a ratio of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% from the fourth quarter and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. 
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. 
During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points.
We are very focused on improving the customer experience starting with the network, simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base.
Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago.
We continue to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer.
Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year. The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers rightsize their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for FiOS Broadband-only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having the choice in selecting linear video packages.
We had another quarter with Custom TV, representing about 1/3 of our FiOS video sales.
In the fourth quarter, FiOS total revenue grew 6.8%, with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the Internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds. As I highlighted earlier, FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year and now have a total of 7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter.
In linear video, we are seeing slowing of market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3% and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4% to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016.
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year.
As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings dependent on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level, and we'll report more details post transaction.
Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the Wireline segment.
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our 3-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic, competitive environment as we work through the transition of our Wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continued to grow at a double-digit rate even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year, excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends.
As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results to date through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appealed to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets. At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets and future spectrum bands that can be made available.
Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year.
Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in Wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities to the global ad tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally, and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL's global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens. We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the Wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which uses our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter. We are encouraged by the use of Go90, not only on the Verizon network but also the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform.
Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee Data, Verizon Wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past 2 quarters, we are offering Custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our FiOS TV offerings to take advantage of the secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend.
We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our connected city strategy beginning with Savannah and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThinkSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%.
Let's move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both Wireless and FiOS and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018, 2019 time frame.
As previously stated, Verizon expects full year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things.
Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full year 2015 performance. Consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion. This includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier. And a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

And then second, obviously, we had an extension of bonus tax depreciation last year. It's been something you've been benefiting from. Could you kind of scope the size of the benefit you're going to get this year? And if I could just one last one. You've talked about how cord shaving has been important for the new customers coming into the FiOS space.

So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings.

So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings. And the way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There is $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale. So that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about plateauing, we're referring to the $3.99. So when you think about this, you're going from $3.86 from a jumpoff point to $3.99. So the way I think about it is we're actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that onetime adjustment. So we will grow through the benefit of the depreciation this year. Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math moving the Wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model. And of course, the ramping of our new businesses, which, I've been very clear in the beginning, these are like start-up businesses. And in most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and they start to generate the profitability. Moving into the bonus depreciation. Yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year. But I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our tax -- cash tax payments will decrease in '16. They will actually increase even with this benefit. And the piece of that is because the profitability from a pretax income perspective will continue to increase, and we're also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations. So from a cash tax perspective, you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now not to the extent of the 35% to 36% guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in '15 to the upper 20% in '16. On the cord shaving piece, as I -- we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into FiOS on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point. So David, hopefully, that answers your question. Let's move to the next one."

So on the auction, let's just -- I'll keep this one short on the incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can't say at this point. But we will participate in the auction, and I'll leave it at that. But thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I've talked about previously, and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead to 5G. As we said, we'll be at the forefront, and we are currently at the forefront globally, talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we're currently preparing for those field trials. The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. And think about 5G, it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other U-cases [ph], not just about mobility. And then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied Consumer Electronics Show this past 2 weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi. And it absolutely shows no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there, and it actually showed that the comparability is it improves the WiFi performance by having the managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the FCC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers. And then, of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps, which we just completed this past quarter. We're working on another swap that we will complete in the first quarter. And also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that's how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective. On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers. Is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon? There's no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory. And as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we'll execute on the transaction. If it doesn't, then we won't. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you, Simon."

Thanks, John. So on the churn rate, if you recall, when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said the concentration of '15 will be to protect our customer base, and that's exactly what we executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us. And I think that's proven through our very lower churn rate this fourth quarter. Even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they're stealing customers, the churn rate does not reflect that. And port-outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers so they understand what they're getting, and this goes to our loyalty base. On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to math, math of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model where you get a break in service revenue, but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We're slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing, so you've already seen the impact of that. As I said the last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will obtain mid-year. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe that, that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter. And we're going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that. As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take devices -- the device payment or subsidy. And what we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of Wireless because of the subsidy take. So having said that, John, I think that as we go through the year, we'll be able to give you more clarity here. But the other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the IARPA metric, which, if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and in the fourth quarter went up 0.9%. So you're already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I'll leave it at that for '16, but I'll come back to you as we break through the 50%."

So the answer to the question is, yes, absolutely. And I think we have to go back to -- and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story.

And I think we have to go back to -- and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. 92% of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled. The other 8% are microwave, which probably won't get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber-enabled. And every small cell, 100% of every small cell we deployed is fiber-backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marni has under IoT, Go90, but also for 5G. If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they are willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this. So when you look at Wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down by 1.9 million. So if you just do the backwards math on that, that's an excess of $1 billion of revenue that wasn't there this year that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon Wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon Wireless revenue streams. On Wireline, FiOS is still the foundation. It's now 80% of the overall Wireline revenue. When you look at what we are doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads, so that's something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I've said, yes, it has a limited life, but you're going to see us refresh Custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is what -- they want choice. They don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use. And then, of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this. Then you jump in to our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016. Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we've seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads, the key is viewership, and it's around content. And we will continue to add content that's favorable to all generations of population. Obviously, we have a lot of content there for millennials, both sports and music, attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we're attacking all viewership with this product, and we'll have more to say about that probably mid-year. Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it's all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our smart cities, telematics, with the launch of hum. We started that in the fourth quarter, and we've already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can't keep the product within Verizon Wireless. They're continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThinkSpace, this is really the adjunct to Consumer Electronics Show where we've opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that's just since October 29 of this year. So yes, it was a transition year in '15, it will be a transition year in '16. But I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking that we will absolutely be a GDP-growth company post 2016. Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. So thanks, Phil."

But 40% of our customers who fulfill their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing. So they're getting the discount, so we're absorbing that. And as I said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur. And you're also already starting to see some of that in the IARPA-type metric. So it's hard for me to forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is that 50%, you start to see an inflection point. We'll talk more about that as we go through the quarters. As far as towers go, look, I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, diversified antenna systems in-building. But keep in mind that each of those small cells in-building and antenna systems all gets fiber back to a main macro cell. So the macro cells still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that's at a much slower rate, but the importance of the tower is still there."

You had a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continued to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn't have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago. So that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. So the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn't what it was a year ago. And if you remember, I said, coming into this back -- way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in the similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year. But if you go back to the previous years, I think you'll see similar lower-volume years, and then you have iconic devices come out and then it stimulates some usage case there.

So on the cost cutting, look, I think the last 3 to 4 years, we've talked about this, and we're an extremely disciplined corporation as far as costs go. With the launch of Verizon Lean Six Sigma program 3 years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there's a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There's a lot of progress being made within our logistics system. I mean, this year alone, we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the Wireless restructure this year was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon Wireless. So as we go into '16, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you, most of that severance charge was related to headcount that was -- is already completed in the fourth quarter. So entering into 2016, we continue on the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there's still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure. And if you look at Wireline, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of Wireline. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that. As far as overall economics, I'm not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at what everybody else looks at, and we'll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I'm certainly not going to predict any negativism there."

It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You're going to see that continue through the 4 quarters of '16, which was not there in '15. So there will be pressure from these start-up companies. Well, our learnings on Go90 are very simple. We're looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in 1 day, and we're starting to see some positive there, where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that's important because that's what's viable to the advertising community. So the whole basis here is we have to ramp viewership. I will tell you, internally, we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for '16 because we needed to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you're seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now there is seasonality to that. But as I mentioned, I'm looking at for them to grow substantially in 2016. So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we're looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not -- especially Go90, will not be a profitable product probably within a 1- to 2-year horizon right now. When we launched it, we said 2 to 3, but that's probably out 2 years before that will become a top profit contributor to the enterprise. But it will certainly build on the top line perspective. But right now, we're focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product. So I'll stop there.

Obviously, when we launched 4G, we said it would be 4 to 5x more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we're going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G. So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holdings as we said with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with that what we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G.

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in the Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I'd like to highlight. Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pretax $3.2 billion credit, which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily noncash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pretax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these 2 items amount to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share.
Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis, if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year.
As a reminder, included in our Wireline results were the operations from the 3 states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized the benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior-period results do not include AOL.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms, in video and In",3933,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms, in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond.
As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic, competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1%, and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders.
Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid gross and net adds as well as net phone additions.
Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total Wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year, and our EBITDA margin expanded.
Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year Wireline segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points.
We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things as well as prepositioning us for the future of 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion.
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain Wireline properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers, and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends. As we disclosed in September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.
We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame. So overall, a strong, balanced 2015, which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future.
Now let's get into fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2%, including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL's performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers.
For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparable full year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less-than-projected take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter.
Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in Wireless and FiOS. The change in the Wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to Wireless equipment volumes. We continue to manage through the transition to the device installment model.
We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. Free cash flow for the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $18.8 billion. We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables, resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources.
Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion and a ratio of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% from the fourth quarter and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. 
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. 
During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points.
We are very focused on improving the customer experience starting with the network, simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet Internet devices.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base.
Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago.
We continue to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer.
Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year. The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers rightsize their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for FiOS Broadband-only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having the choice in selecting linear video packages.
We had another quarter with Custom TV, representing about 1/3 of our FiOS video sales.
In the fourth quarter, FiOS total revenue grew 6.8%, with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the Internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds. As I highlighted earlier, FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year and now have a total of 7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter.
In linear video, we are seeing slowing of market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3% and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4% to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016.
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year.
As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings dependent on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level, and we'll report more details post transaction.
Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the Wireline segment.
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our 3-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic, competitive environment as we work through the transition of our Wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continued to grow at a double-digit rate even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year, excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends.
As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results to date through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appealed to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets. At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets and future spectrum bands that can be made available.
Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year.
Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in Wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities to the global ad tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally, and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL's global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens. We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the Wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which uses our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter. We are encouraged by the use of Go90, not only on the Verizon network but off of the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform.
Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee Data, Verizon Wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past 2 quarters, we are offering Custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our FiOS TV offerings to take advantage of the secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend.
We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our connected city strategy beginning with Savannah and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThinkSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%.
Let's move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both Wireless and FiOS and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018, 2019 time frame.
As previously stated, Verizon expects full year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things.
Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full year 2015 performance. Consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion. This includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier. And a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings. And the way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. The",440,"Thanks, David. So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think, mid-year in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings. And the way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There is $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale. So that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about plateauing, we're referring to the $3.99. So when you think about this, you're going from $3.86 from a jumpoff point to $3.99. So the way I think about it is we're actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that onetime adjustment. So we will grow through the benefit of the depreciation this year. Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math moving the Wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model. And of course, the ramping of our new businesses, which, I've been very clear in the beginning, these are like start-up businesses. And in most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and they start to generate the profitability. Moving into the bonus depreciation. Yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year. But I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our tax -- cash tax payments will decrease in '16. They will actually increase even with this benefit. And the piece of that is because the profitability from a pretax income perspective will continue to increase, and we're also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations. So from a cash tax perspective, you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now not to the extent of the 35% to 36% guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in '15 to the upper 20% in '16. On the cord shaving piece, as I -- we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into FiOS on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point. So David, hopefully, that answers your question. Let's move to the next one."

So on the auction, let's just -- I'll keep this one short on the incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can't say at this point. But we will participate in the auction, and I'll leave it at that. But thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I've talked about previously, and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead to 5G. As we said, we'll be at the forefront, and we are currently at the forefront globally, talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we're currently preparing for those field trials. The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. And think about 5G, it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other U-cases [ph], not just about mobility. And then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied Consumer Electronics Show this past 2 weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi. And it absolutely shows no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there, and it actually showed that the comparability is it improves the WiFi performance by having the managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the FCC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers. And then, of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps, which we just completed this past quarter. We're working on another swap that we will complete in the first quarter. And also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that's how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective. On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers. Is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon? There's no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory. And as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we'll execute on the transaction. If it doesn't, then we won't. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you, Simon."

Thanks, John. So on the churn rate, if you recall, when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said the concentration of '15 will be to protect our customer base, and that's exactly what we executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us. And I think that's proven through our very low churn rate this fourth quarter. Even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they're stealing customers, the churn rate does not reflect that. And port-outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers so they understand what they're getting, and this goes to our loyalty base. On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to math, math of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model where you get a break in service revenue, but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We're slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing, so you've already seen the impact of that. As I said the last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will attain mid-year. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe that, that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter. And we're going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that. As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take devices -- the device payment or subsidy. And what we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of Wireless because of the subsidy take. So having said that, John, I think that as we go through the year, we'll be able to give you more clarity here. But the other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the IARPA metric, which, if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and in the fourth quarter went up 0.9%. So you're already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I'll leave it at that for '16, but I'll come back to you as we break through the 50%."

And I think we have to go back to -- and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. 92% of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled. The other 8% are microwave, which probably won't get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber-enabled. And every small cell, 100% of every small cell we deployed is fiber-backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marni has under IoT, Go90, but also for 5G. If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they are willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this. So when you look at Wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down by 1.9 million. So if you just do the backwards math on that, that's an excess of $1 billion of revenue that wasn't there this year that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon Wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon Wireless revenue streams. On Wireline, FiOS is still the foundation. It's now 80% of the overall Wireline revenue. When you look at what we are doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads, so that's something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I've said, yes, it has a limited life, but you're going to see us refresh Custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is what -- they want choice. They don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use. And then, of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this. Then you jump in to our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016. Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we've seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads, the key is viewership, and it's around content. And we will continue to add content that's favorable to all generations of population. Obviously, we have a lot of content there for millennials, both sports and music, attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we're attacking all viewership with this product, and we'll have more to say about that probably mid-year. Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it's all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our smart cities, telematics, with the launch of hum. We started that in the fourth quarter, and we've already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can't keep the product within Verizon Wireless. They're continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThinkSpace, this is really the adjunct to Consumer Electronics Show where we've opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that's just since October 29 of this year. So yes, it was a transition year in '15, it will be a transition year in '16. But I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking that we will absolutely be a GDP-growth company post 2016. Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. So thanks, Phil."

But 40% of our customers who fulfill their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing. So they're getting the discount, so we're absorbing that. And as I said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur. And you're also already starting to see some of that in the IARPA-type metric. So it's hard for me to forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is that 50%, you start to see an inflection point. We'll talk more about that as we go through the quarters. As far as towers go, look, I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, diversified antenna systems in-building. But keep in mind that each of those small cells in-building and antenna systems all gets fiber back to a main macro cell. So the macro cells still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that's at a much slower rate, but the importance of the tower is still there."

You had a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continued to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn't have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago. So that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. So the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn't what it was a year ago. And if you remember, I said, coming into this back -- way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in the similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year.

We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there's a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There's a lot of progress being made within our logistics system. I mean, this year alone, we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the Wireless restructure this year was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon Wireless. So as we go into '16, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you, most of that severance charge was related to headcount that was -- is already completed in the fourth quarter. So entering into 2016, we continue on the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there's still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure. And if you look at Wireline, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of Wireline. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that. As far as overall economics, I'm not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive.

And just given your comments about roughly flat year-over-year EPS and the impact that Go90 might have on that, I think a lot of us have concluded that there's likely to be something significantly bigger coming this year with respect to marketing and content. Can you at least give us a time line for when we might see those kinds of developments on Go90?"

So when I think about the whole portfolio of Go90, Verizon Digital Media Services and AOL, obviously, we just launched all these products, so there's a start-up. It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launch",342,"Sure. Thanks, Craig. So when I think about the whole portfolio of Go90, Verizon Digital Media Services and AOL, obviously, we just launched all these products, so there's a start-up. It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You're going to see that continue through the 4 quarters of '16, which was not there in '15. So there will be pressure from these start-up companies. Well, our learnings on Go90 are very simple. We're looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in 1 day, and we're starting to see some positive there, where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that's important because that's what's viable to the advertising community. So the whole basis here is we have to ramp viewership. I will tell you, internally, we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for '16 because we needed to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you're seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now there is seasonality to that. But as I mentioned, I'm looking at for them to grow substantially in 2016. So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we're looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not -- especially Go90, will not be a profitable product probably within a 1- to 2-year horizon right now. When we launched it, we said 2 to 3, but that's probably out 2 years before that will become a top profit contributor to the enterprise. But it will certainly build on the top line perspective. But right now, we're focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product. So I'll stop there. We -- as I said, we will come in with much more detail probably mid-year and start to give you some viewership into exactly some of the results of Go90 and AOL."

So if you think about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming. Obviously, when we launched 4G, we said it would be 4 to 5x more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we're going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G. So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holdings as we said with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with that what we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G. So utilizing all of these items, we feel that we are in very, very good shape from a capacity standpoint."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. 
Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial result that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in the filings with the SEC. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $1.06 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $142 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, the loss and settlement accounting amounted to $102 million or $0.02 per share, and the gain on the spectrum transaction amounted to $88 million or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other, including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per share of $1.06 in the first quarter compared to $1.02 per share a year ago or a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the first quarter of 2015. 
As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the 3 states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pretax or about $0.03 per share due to these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pretax benefit or $0.02 per share that we recognized in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior-period results. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our three-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms and video and Internet of Things, and create incremental revenue opportunities and applications and content. In terms of progress on this multitier strategy, we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency while we develop new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. 
We are also developing a portfolio of unique content targeted that the millennial generation so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile. At the network connectivity layer, we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. Having the Best Network does matter as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later. 
We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage and implementing a number of optimization techniques such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year. Over the long term, densification of our Wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage these growing consumption trends as well as to pre-position ourselves for the 5G technology of the future. A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber. During the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications, which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide as well to lease millimeterwave spectrum for 5G testing purposes with the option to buy. We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston that will support wireless and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network-efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility to innovate, develop and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets. 
In terms of 5G, our technical testing is going well, and there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G forum to prepare for fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year. 
Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business and are making progress in driving efficiencies, reducing overhead costs and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that have already been taken and others that we plan to implement for 2016 and beyond. 
In the fourth quarter 2015, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first quarter. Overall, consolidated headcount since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3% as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016. 
We continue to streamline business support functions utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive consistency and improve speed of delivery in the market. Across Wireless, we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the store operations, call center operations and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model while improving the overall customer experience. 
Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs. Always more work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress. 
Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue streams through new ecosystems, platforms, content and solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens. 
The video platform continues to expand as we add more unique content that appeals to millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing 2 initial channels of video programming targeting the digital millennial audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms. Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire an equity stake in AwesomenessTV and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on Go90. Just over the past few days, we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investment in AwesomenessTV and Complex Media positions us as partial owners in the #1 digital media brands for the young millennials. 
On the Go90 application, we remain encouraged by the viewership of Go90. But as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining traction and engagement. Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts and original series content within Go90 on their mobile devices and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our freebie data service. We look forward to expanding our Go90 content to other media through our AOL brand and the web later this year. 
Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, we continued to develop platforms and our network to took advantage of the opportunities to innovate and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic and business challenges. We have launched our own utility, transportation healthcare solutions with products like Network Fleet, GridWide, Verizon Share, Hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent Track and Trace. Our ThinkSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster and more accessible to develop applications. 
New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of about 25%. While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority. 
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter. Earnings per share grew 3.9%, and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders. Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. AOL had its best first quarter revenues in the last 5 years, driven by growth in the platform layer. If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower Wireless phone activations on the device installment sales, lower upgrades and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing. In Wireline, the higher growth of Internet-only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. As we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile. Consistent with the prior year, consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion, and our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven by our ability to manage cost and expand margin even with the pressure on the top line. 
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash receipt from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations. We continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping the securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $4 billion. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was a result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. 
Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net debt of $104 million and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x. We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pretax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the current quarter. In early April, we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt balance. 
Now let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled 640,000 in a seasonally low-volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections including IoT. Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter as compared to a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year driven by customer retention. Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. We have taken many actions to improve and simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction. We ended the quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds, we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in phone net adds were basic devices. Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product, which we introduced last year. Net prepaid devices declined by 177,000. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base. As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrade in the first quarter. About 5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points. 
Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on Slide 9. In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7% and had in EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter to $22 billion. Service revenue was $16.8 billion, declined 6.2% for the quarter as a result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and then equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan. As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline midyear when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year, we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of 2017. 
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter compared with about 67% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70% due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which contributed to lower equipment revenue growth. We expect the second quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%. During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass Markets, which includes small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter, FiOS total revenue grew 5%, with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 4.7%. The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the FiOS growth. At the end of the quarter, about 78% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident as about 60% of our consumer FiOS Internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits and above. FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband, we added 98,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter. 
The consumer revenue growth trajectory continue to decline as customers downsize their existing bundles and core voice services are no longer desired. We introduced the next generation of our Custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content in value provided by the original Custom TV offer to appeal to even a wider range of value-conscious customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an essentials plan and a sports and more plan with the option to select up to 3 additional packs. The demand for Custom TV remained strong, and during the first quarter, Custom TV represented about 38% of our FiOS Video sales. Due to the lower sale of the bundle and the lower content cost associated with the Custom TV, a Custom TV customer generates less revenue but contributes more margin than the traditional FiOS Video customer. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant currency basis, it was down about 2.6%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both enterprise and global wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results. 
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment post the Frontier transaction. Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated with these 3 markets will be included in Corporate and Other beginning with the second quarter results. For illustrative purposes, on a preliminary basis, we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide 9 quarters of recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the 3 markets later in the second quarter. Recast total revenue for the first quarter of 2016, excluding these 3 markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year. As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with our fiber infrastructure and FiOS products. Recast Wireline margin, excluding these markets, decreased, as expected, since these properties were more profitable than the properties that remained. Without these properties, the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately 19%. We have been working on our post-Frontier transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated before, we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded cost at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to first quarter 2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. 
Let's move next to Slide 13 for an overview of our liability management. Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion, and at the end of the first quarter 2016, our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter of 2016. In early April 2016, we utilized Frontier proceeds plus cash on hand to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face value debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher-cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future. The Frontier-related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half of 2016 and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September, are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan. Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018 to 2019 time frame. At the same time, we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with a priority to invest for the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt profile and return value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each year. 
Let's move next to Slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities. We are off to a strong start in 2016 as we executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers, delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and on further developing new ecosystems. At the operational level, we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline revenues, improving our overall cost structure and ramping new revenue streams. At this point in the year, we continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations, we may need to update the full year guidance at a later time. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So we announced the intent to extend FiOS in Boston, understand that the LFA has to be negotiated with City Council, and that is a public process that will take approximately 6 months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework, but we need to go through that process. It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G. So obviously, when we look at Boston, it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we look at all of our current COs around the print and the fiber that we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say, we can do the fiber buildout to expand the LTE densification, but we also can use this opportunity with only an increment of about $300 million over the next 5 to 6 years to expand our FiOS footprint. So the $300 million, you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers. It's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent regardless of whether we expanded FiOS. So we will get to this, but we are starting to -- we will start this midyear this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the Internet capability with passing homes. But for the video product, we will have the way to go through the LFA City Council process."

Right, so one guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. Just t",701,"Sure. Thanks, Simon. Right, so one guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. Just to set the record here, I mean, again, we did not give revenue guidance. We gave EBITDA margin percent guidance, and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015. So if you step back a second and look at the earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our assets held for sale, so really the comparable number is $3.86. And as we said, we felt good about growing earnings back to the $3.99 through our normal operation results of the business. So if you take that fourth quarter and move it forward for the first quarter, $1.06, that would mean we're $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04, which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. So if you start out your baseline from last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken off the top of that. And then as we talked, there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded cost. And again, I want to reiterate that we've always said that the stranded cost would be offset on a consolidated basis not within total Wireline segment. So we do have some timing here. We're looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute and offset some of the stranded costs. So you can see we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis. But other things that we're looking at is around distribution centers, in call centers. As you know, call centers are very high turnover rate for employees. And with our decreasing calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not hire as many customer call centers, and we'll achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call centers. So there's opportunity to reduce force just through the attrition rate. And then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiency that we gain there. So as we look at this, there will be some timing. So Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04, but we're looking at -- we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the other things we're doing. Now finally, obviously, on this, the timing of the union agreement, we have planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we will come back in midyear. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning shareholder value for our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully, that clears it up a little bit. On the second question or the second part of your question around the strike. At this point, it's too early to tell the impacts. I mean, we've deployed thousands of management employees to take on the work. We obviously, always during this period of time, fall a little bit behind on the install work. We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective, so there's a little bit of the backlog there and we'll just have to work through this. But right now, really no financial impact per se in the second quarter that I'm anticipating unless this drags on for a much longer period of time. On the data center sale, look, I mean this is still, I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on but nothing at this point that I'm prepared to announce in a public forum, but we continue to explore that activity."

But if I do the Math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset, the earnings would be reasonably materially higher. And my math is that the year-over-year earnings power of Verizon had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here would have been about 10%. And Street estimates are really looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on kind of what you see is the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as you kind of think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for us second? And then just a second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter. But obviously, reports are that it's been lower than normal.

So look, I mean, we've been pretty open about 2016, and of course, we've got a lot of things going on in a lot of different directions. I mean, obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're still increasing the profitability of that business, and it's really the recurring revenue that we're focused in on and the quality of our customers. On the Wireline side of the house, again, you see there's pressure on top line because of Custom TV and Internet only now versus triple play. But again, we are improving the profitability of that business. So for this year, we'll stick with what we talk about on guidance. Mike and I have been pretty open and have been pretty open about '17. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in '17. But I would not attribute this to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio that's putting pressure on some of the bottom line. So I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture. I mean, we've got a really good value for that. We're going to put the cash to work that really benefits the earnings power of this company, and that's the way I look at it. On the upgrade rate, look, I mean if you look at year-over-year, we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate, and obviously, that had a lot of impact on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we're seeing is our embedded base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter, 70%, and fell short to 68%. So if you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, I mean you would think that the stronger uptake and device installment plan will drive more margin. But in fact, we missed that metric. We did lower. And we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving parts here. But to your question of where do I think upgrade rates are going to go, at this point, based on what we know, we think upgrade rates are relatively the same as '15. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at this point in time."

So on the investment side, look, I mean we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A- rated company and we're on track to do that. In everything we do, that continues to be the top priority. So even with all the M&A activity you've seen, I mean if you look back, we started this on a pre-Vodafone debt of -- post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to $109 billion. But keep in mind that was with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time. That was with $4 billion of purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase, and now we've just sold the Frontier properties that helps bring that debt down even to a lower level. So we are right on course, but that is top-of-mind at everything we do and will continue to be a commitment that Will and I made, that is forefront that we will commit to. On the AOL performance, look, I think I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL. But look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the last 5 years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year-over-year now. Of course, that's seasonal. But that's shows you, though, that the investments we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in-type investments that we made with acquisitions and these are small acquisitions, but they're real critical. I mean, if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with Riot, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really hub post for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news. But again, this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that, quite honestly, Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition, it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform. The other thing you're going to see us do this year, too, is around Go90. The Go90 product will start across all of the AOL platforms this year. That is going to enhance both the AOL platforms, and it's always also going to enhance the Go90 platform. So look, continuing with our strategy, we will, as I said before, we will open the box at some point in time to give you more viable -- visibility to this. And I continue to say that, that will be midyear to maybe third quarter of this year where we'll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms that we talked about."

Look, I mean, I'm not going to speak anything to deal with Yahoo!. So let's just talk about what we have on the table today.

So for example, if any party, third-party is interested in that, we will offer that on a [indiscernible] basis and we price it accordingly at a commercially favorable rate that we believe is in direct, really, compliance with the FCC net neutrality rules. We think that sponsor data and other FreeBee Data programs are good for the consumer, and as regular visit recognize that after concluding the review of our product. So based on the 0 data, we'll have to wait and see where they come out on that. As far as Title II gross, look, I mean we agree with all the principles with net neutrality rule. The thing that we disagree with in the post was applying Title II to broadband services and particularly wireless broadband. So we'll have to see where this comes out. But reclassing broadband under title II was not necessary to ensure an open Internet. I mean, there's been nothing ever that shows that it not has been an open internet. So this will obviously have some negative consequences on innovation as a whole. But look, I mean we're company that has operated under regulation for 100 years and has been very successful. So we'll wait to see what the FCC concludes and then we'll operate accordingly, but it's too early to say what exactly is going to happen here."

So on the competitive environment Verizon, I mean, look, coming into '15 and again '16, we said that the top priority would be to maintain the high quality of our base, and you see us doing that. I mean, we now have 48% of our base overall on the new pricing, and we continue to push for that. So you saw the 7 basis point increase in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say, though, is if you look ahead, last year second quarter, the churn was like 0.90. I would not anticipate nor should you anticipate that, that we will achieve that churn rates again because things have kind of flattened out now. So I would look out the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective. And part of that is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before where we gave a free tablet away, and we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. And they signed up for the 2-year agreement because they got a tablet for $10 a month or $240, and they disconnected it at the end of the agreement. So we stopped doing that promotion for that recent, but you see some of these tablets now coming up on the 2-year deal, so we anticipate that some of that the higher churn in that tablet environment will hit is over the next couple of quarters. So we should be prepared for that. But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate overall. So I think that's really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we're dedicating all of our concentration in our promos. On the prepaid side, absolutely. I mean, our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for all whole host of reasons, and it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high-quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product. If you look at the competitive nature, they're doing it with some brands. They're not really doing it with their brands. And quite honestly, we use the Tracfone brand as our prepaid product. And TracFone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller, but it continues to increase on the high-quality base of TracFone. So that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market. More to come on this during the year, but currently, that's how we operate under the prepaid model."

So on the video landscape, look, I mean we've set the bar where we're going with video, both in the home and outside the home. So in the home, we were the first to come out with our Custom TV package, which we bundle certain content, and it's been very successful. I mean this quarter, even with the rebundle of Custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle. And what I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top line pressure because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective, but the content cost is considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us. So it's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch of 17 on average. So we're trying to give customers what they want. And that's a fight obviously with all the content providers, but we're doing it within the legality of our contracts. And of course, we won't breach any of our contracts. But it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any approach to our in-home delivery. The other thing is there is confusion out there on the video side, which is everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset, and this is something new. This has been done to the last 2 years. Everybody who has a in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability to view that content as long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription. They can watch that on their mobile handset. We're taking really this strategy and a whole different in a different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home. It has nothing to do with in-home content. Now some of the content you could watch at home could be on this for like sports that has been very popular in the Go90 environment. But we're looking at a lot of different mobile-first, short clips, news, sports, and if you think about it, original content. And if you look at the strategy that we have taken in the last couple of quarters, we've added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home. So if you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create 2 very exclusive channels for us. One is called Video Red. One is called Seriously TV. And the target population is 12 to 24. We then, as I said in my preamble remarks, AwesomenessTV, we took a 25% ownership stake. Because what we saw was there were certain original content that we have contracted with them that they deploy in Go90, and we saw our viewership really jump when those original contents presented themselves. So this is another one where #1 digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24, 160 million views, up 53% year-over-year. And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying complex, 50% owner. This is another #1 digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24, monthly unique viewers of 54 million and over 300 million views per month. So this is really where we're taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than wat everyone else is talking about. And we believe that's where we are going to be differentiated brand with Go90 and AOL and everything else that we're doing around that video platform. So that's kind of where we're at on that. On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say, as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration of that base on the what I'll call the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out and we start to see accretion at the back end of '17. And we've run a number of models and we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we are at at this point in time."

So first one, on just the CapEx. Look, there's some timing here, and the reason that is, is because if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend really in Wireless to prepare for the super Bowl, and that was a whole densification strategy on the West Coast around San Francisco and Santa Clara. So really, what you're seeing here is a timing issue. We are right on track with our plan on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells. So there is nothing that I'm going to say here that should concern you about our plans, and you'll see us catch up on that spend in the second and through the third and the fourth quarter. So coming in right on guidance, the only thing I will say here is, keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier that will disappear in the second quarter. So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past, but again, right on track with where we thought we would be. On the 5G question, look, we are committed to being the first U.S. company to roll out 5G Wireless technology. We are currently, what I would call, doing sandbox. Sandbox is creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G technology forum, which includes all the major OEMs and handset OEMs. We will involve -- evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation. Currently, we're testing 5G technologies this year, and we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilots starting in 2017. And I want to reiterate that. This is a fixed wireless which is really one of the first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile. It's really about fixed wireless. We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz, and we're working with the FCC. And as you know, with XO, we have the ability for an option to buy around 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're doing our testing right now. And then keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G, so this is not a capital-intense overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about high-speed video delivery over wireless network in a very, very efficient way. You should think about 5G, again like we did without you where you see those 4 to 5 incremental cost decreases when delivering that video, that's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment. So right now, that's where we're at, but we continue to plow forward and we will be ready to go with the 5G technology."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial result that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in the filings with the SEC. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $1.06 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $142 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, the loss and settlement accounting amounted to $102 million or $0.02 per share and the gain on the spectrum transaction amounted to $88 million or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other, including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per share of $1.06 in the first quarter compared to $1.02 per share a year ago or a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the first quarter of 2015.
As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the 3 states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pretax or about $0.03 per share due to these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pretax benefit or $0.02 per share that we recognized in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior-period results.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our three-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms and video and Internet of Things and create incremental revenue opportunities and applications and content. In terms of progress on this multi-tier strategy, we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency, while we develop new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally.
We are also developing a portfolio of unique content targeted at the millennial generation, so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile. At the network connectivity layer, we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. Having the best network does matter, as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later.
We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage and implementing a number of optimization techniques, such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year. Over the long term, densification of our Wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage these growing consumption trends as well as to preposition ourselves for the 5G technology of the future. A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber.
During the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications, which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide as well as to lease millimeter wave spectrum for 5G testing purposes with the option to buy. We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston, that will support wireless and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network-efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility to innovate, develop and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets.
In terms of 5G, our technical testing is going well, and there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G forum to prepare for fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year.
Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business and are making progress in driving efficiencies, reducing overhead costs and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that have already been taken and others that we plan to implement for 2016 and beyond.
In the fourth quarter 2015, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first quarter. Overall, consolidated headcount since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3% as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016.
We continue to streamline business support functions utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive consistency and improve speed of delivery in the market. Across Wireless, we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the store operations, call center operations and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model while improving the overall customer experience.
Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs. Always more work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress.
Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue streams through new ecosystems, platforms, content and solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens.
The video platform continues to expand as we add more unique content that appeals to millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing 2 initial channels of video programming targeting the digital millennial audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms. Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire an equity stake in AwesomenessTV and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on go90. Just over the past few days, we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investments in AwesomenessTV and Complex Media position us as partial owners in the #1 digital media brands for young millennials.
On the go90 application, we remain encouraged by the viewership of go90. But as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining traction and engagement. Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts and original series content within go90 on their mobile devices and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our freebie data service. We look forward to expanding our go90 content to other media through our AOL brands and the web later this year.
Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, we continue to develop platforms and our network to took advantage of the opportunities to innovate and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic and business challenges. We have launched our own utility, transportation and healthcare solutions with products like Networkfleet, Grid Wide, Verizon Share, hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent Track and Trace. Our ThinkSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster and more accessible to develop applications.
New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of about 25%. While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority.
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter. Earnings per share grew 3.9% and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders. Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. AOL had its best first quarter revenues in the last 5 years, driven by growth in the platform layer. If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower Wireless phone activations on the device installment sales, lower upgrades and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing. In Wireline, the higher growth of Internet-only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. As we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile. Consistent with the prior year, consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion, and our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven by our ability to manage cost and expand margin, even with the pressure on the top line.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operation totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations. We continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping the securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $4 billion. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was a result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net debt of $104 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x. We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pretax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the current quarter. In early April, we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt balance.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled 640,000 in a seasonally low-volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections including IoT. Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter as compared to a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year, driven by customer retention. Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. We have taken many actions to improve and simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction. We ended the quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds, we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in phone net adds were basic devices. Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product, which we introduced last year. Net prepaid devices declined by 177,000.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base. As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrades in the first quarter. About 5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points.
Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on Slide 9. In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7% and had an EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter to $22 billion. Service revenue was $16.8 billion, declined 6.2% for the quarter as a result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan. As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline midyear when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year, we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of 2017.
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter compared with about 67% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70% due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which contributed to lower equipment revenue growth. We expect the second quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%. During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass Markets, which includes small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter, Fios total revenue grew 5%, with consumer Fios revenue growing at 4.7%. The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the Fios growth. At the end of the quarter, about 78% of our consumer Fios Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident as about 60% of our consumer Fios Internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits and above. Fios Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband, we added 98,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter. In Fios Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter.
The consumer revenue growth trajectory continues to decline as customers downsize their existing bundles and core voice services are no longer desired. We introduced the next generation of our Custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content and value provided by the original Custom TV offer to appeal to even wide range of value-conscious customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an essentials plan and a sports and more plan with the option to select up to 3 additional packs. The demand for Custom TV remained strong, and during the first quarter, Custom TV represented about 38% of our Fios Video sales. Due to the lower sale of the bundle and the lower content cost associated with the Custom TV, a Custom TV customer generates less revenue, but contributes more margin than the traditional Fios Video customer.
Let's turn to Slide x11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant currency basis, it was down about 2.6%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both enterprise and global wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results.
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment post the Frontier transaction. Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated with these 3 markets will be included in Corporate and Other, beginning with the second quarter results. For illustrative purposes, on a preliminary basis, we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide 9 quarters of recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the 3 markets later in the second quarter. Recast total revenue for the first quarter 2016, excluding these 3 markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year. As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with our fiber infrastructure and Fios products. Recast Wireline margin, excluding these markets, decreased as expected since these properties were more profitable than the properties that remained. Without these properties, the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately 19%. We have been working on our post-Frontier transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated before, we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded cost at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
Let's move next to Slide 13 for an overview of our liability management. Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion, and at the end of the first quarter 2016, our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter 2016. In early April 2016, we utilized Frontier proceeds plus cash on hand to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face value debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher-cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future. The Frontier-related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half of 2016 and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September, are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan. Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018 to 2019 time frame. At the same time, we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt profile and returned value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each year.
Let's move next to Slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities. We are off to a strong start in 2016 as we executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers, delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and on further developing new ecosystems. At the operational level, we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline revenues, improving our overall cost structure and ramping new revenue streams. At this point in the year, we continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations, we may need to update the full year guidance at a later time.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Well, I mean, Boston is a unique situation. So we announced the intent to extend Fios in Boston. Understand that the LFA has to be negotiated with City Council, and that is a public process that will take approximately 6 months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework, but we need to go through that process. It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G. So obviously, when we looked at Boston, it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we looked at all of our current COs around the footprint and the fiber that we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say we can do the fiber buildout to expand the LTE densification, but we also can use this opportunity with only an increment of about $300 million over the next 5 to 6 years to expand our Fios footprint. So the $300 million, you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers, it's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent regardless of whether we expanded Fios. So we will get to this, but we are starting to -- we will start this midyear this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the Internet capability with passing homes. But for the video product, we will have to wait to go through the LFA City Council process."

So one guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident that at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last y",704,"Sure. Thanks, Simon. All right. So one guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident that at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. Just to set the record here, I mean, again, we did not give revenue guidance, we gave EBITDA margin percent guidance, and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015. So if you step back a second and look at earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our assets held for sale, so really the comparable number is $3.86. And as we said, we felt good about growing earnings back to that $3.99 through our normal operation results of the business. So if you take that fourth quarter and move it forward for the first quarter, $1.06, that would mean we're $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04, which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. So if you start out your baseline from last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken right off the top for that. And then as we talked, there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded cost. And again, I want to reiterate that we've always said that the stranded cost would be offset on a consolidated basis, not within total Wireline segment. So we do have some timing here. We're looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute and offset some of the stranded costs. So you can see we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis. But other things that we're looking at is around distribution centers, in call centers. As you know, call centers are very high turnover rate for employees. And with our decreasing calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not hire as many customer call centers, and we'll achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call centers. So there's opportunity to reduce force just through the attrition rate. And then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiency that we gain there. So as we look at this, there will be some timing. So Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04, but we're looking at -- we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the other things we're doing. Now finally, obviously, on this, the timing of the union agreement, we have planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we will come back in midyear. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning shareholder value to our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully, that clears it up a little bit. On the second question or the second part of your question around the strike, at this point, it's too early to tell the impacts. I mean, we've deployed thousands of management employees to take on the work. We obviously, always during this period of time, fall a little bit behind on the install work. We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective, so there's a little bit of a backlog there, and we'll just have to work through this. But right now, really no financial impact per se in the second quarter that I'm anticipating, unless this drags on for a much longer period of time. On the data center sale, look, I mean this is still -- I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on, but nothing at this point that I'm prepared to announce in a public forum, but we continue to explore that activity."

But if I do the math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset, the earnings would be reasonably materially higher. And my math is that the year-over-year earnings power of Verizon, had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here, would have been about 10%. And Street estimates are really only looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on kind of what you see is the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as we kind of think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for a second? And then just the second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter, but obviously, reports are that it's been lower than normal. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see the cadence for the shape of the year with the iPhone 7 likely coming out the back part of the year and kind of the amount of upgrades you'd see kind of by that point in time?"

So on earnings, look, I mean, we've been pretty open about 2016, and of course, we've got a lot of things going on in a lot of different directions. I mean, obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're still increasing the profitability of that business, and it's really the recurring revenue that we're focused in on and the quality of our customers. On the Wireline side of the house, again, you see there's pressure on top line because of Custom TV and Internet only now versus triple play. But again, we are improving the profitability of that business. So for this year, we'll stick with what we talked about on guidance. Mike and I have been pretty open and Lo have been pretty open about '17. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in '17. But I would not attribute this to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio, that's putting pressure on some of the bottom line. So I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture. I mean, we've got a really good value for that, that we're going to put the cash to work, that really benefits the earnings power of this company, and that's the way I look at it. On the upgrade rate, look, I mean, if you look at year-over-year, we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate, and obviously, that had a lot of impact on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we're seeing is our embedded base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter of 70% and fell short to 68%. So if you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, I mean, you would think that the stronger uptake and device installment plan will drive more margin. But in fact, we missed that metric, we did lower, and we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving parts here. But to your question of where do I think upgrade rates are going to go, at this point, based on what we know, we think that upgrade rates will be relatively the same as '15. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at this point in time."

So on FCC special access, look, the FCC will take action this month some time on special access rulemaking, and it's tariff investigation of a certain discount that we and other large legacy providers offer for the DS1s and 3s. I mean, we've reached out -- we reached a deal with a lot of the CLECs in order to resolve a long-standing and contentious regulatory issue here. Our top priority, though, is to ensure that our business services are on a level playing field with all the other competitors, including cable companies. We intend to work with the industry and the FCC to develop a framework for that, that applies to all competitors equally and relies on the sound public policy to determine where and when regulation is appropriate. So we'll wait to see what the FCC does here, Phil, and then we'll respond accordingly. On the bond market and the recent press reports coming out of Bloomberg, look, we've been pretty open in public that we have been looking at an alternative financing arrangement for our installment sale receivables. The public asset-backed market is an alternative that we've explored. We've had a number of discussions. We are having discussions, continuing with alternative providers and various parties. But at this point in time, these are just discussions. It's something we're looking at. We're still doing a lot of analysis around it. And at this point, it's just something the we continue to look at and nothing to announce here today that we're going to change anything at this point in time."

So on the investment side, look, I mean we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A- rated company, and we're on track to do that. In everything we do, that continues to be the top priority. So even with all of the M&A activity you've seen, I mean, if you look back, we started this on a pre-Vodafone debt of -- post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to $109 billion. But keep in mind, that was with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time. That was with $4 billion of purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase, and now we've just sold the Frontier properties that, that helps bring that debt down even to a lower level. So we are right on course, but that is top-of-mind at everything that we do and will continue to be a commitment that Lo and I made, that is forefront that we will commit to. On the AOL performance, look, I think I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL, but look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the last 5 years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year-over-year now. Of course, that's seasonal, but that's shows you, though, that the investments that we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in-type investments that we made with acquisitions, and these are small acquisitions, but they're real critical. I mean, if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with Riot, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post, for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news. But again, this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that, quite honestly, Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition, it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform. The other thing you're going to see us do this year, too, is around go90. The go90 product will start across all of the AOL platforms this year. That is going to enhance both the AOL platforms, and it's always -- also going to enhance the go90 platform. So look, continuing with our strategy, we will -- as I said before, we will open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this. And I continue to say that, that will be midyear to maybe third quarter of this year where we'll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms that we talk about."

Well, look, I mean, I'm not going to speak anything to deal with Yahoo. So let's just talk about what we have on the table today. And under the sponsored data zero rating-type issue, I mean the net neutrality already advocates some of this. And we've structured our sponsor data program to comply with all the FCC net neutrality rules. So for example, if any party, third-party, is interested in that, we will offer that on a nondiscriminatory basis, and we priced it accordingly at a commercially favorable rate that we believe is in direct, really, compliance with the FCC net neutrality rule. We think that sponsored data and other FreeBee Data programs are good for the consumer, and regulars will recognize that after concluding their review on our product. So based on the zero data, we'll have to wait and see where they come out on that. As far as Title II goes, look, I mean, we agree with all the principles with net neutrality rule. The thing that we disagreed with and opposed was applying Title II to broadband services and particularly wireless broadband. So we'll have to see where this comes out. But reclassing broadband under Title II was not necessary to ensure an open Internet. I mean, there's been nothing ever that shows that it not has been an open internet. So this will obviously have some negative consequences on innovation as a whole. But look, I mean, we're a company that has operated under regulation for 100 years and has been very successful. So we'll wait to see what the FCC concludes and then we'll operate accordingly, but it's too early to say what exactly is going to happen here."

So on the competitive environment of Verizon, I mean, look, coming into '15 and again in '16, we said that the top priority would be to maintain the high quality of our base, and you see us doing that. I mean, we now have 48% of our base overall on the new pricing, and we continue to push for that. So you saw the 7 basis point increase in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say, though, is if you look ahead, last year second quarter, the churn was like 0.90. I would not anticipate nor should you anticipate that, that we will achieve that churn rates again because things have kind of flattened out now. So I would look at the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective. And part of that is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before where we gave a free tablet away, and we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. And they signed up for the 2-year agreement because they got a tablet for $10 a month or $240, and they disconnected it at the end of the agreement. So we stopped doing that promotion for that reason, but you see some of these tablets now coming up on the 2-year deal. So we anticipate that some of that higher churn in that tablet environment will hit is over the next couple of quarters. So we should be prepared for that. But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate, overall. So I think that's really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we're dedicating all of our concentration in our promos. On the prepaid side, absolutely. I mean, our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for a whole host of reasons, and it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high-quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product. If you look at the competitive nature, they're doing it with sub brands, they're not really doing it with their brands. And quite honestly, we use the TracFone brand as our prepaid product. And TracFone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller, but it continues to increase on the high-quality base of TracFone. So that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market. More to come on this during the year, but currently, that's how we operate under the prepaid model."

So on the video landscape, look, I mean we've set the bar on where we're going on video, both in the home and outside the home. So in the home, we were the first to come out with our Custom TV package, which rebundled certain content, and it's been very successful. I mean, this quarter, even with the rebundle of Custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle. And what I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top line pressure because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective, but the content cost is considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us. So it's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch 17 on average. So we're trying to give customers what they want. And that's a fight, obviously, with all the content providers, but we're doing it within the legality of our contracts. And of course, we won't breach any of our contracts. But it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any approach to our in-home delivery. The other thing is there is confusion out there on the video side, which is everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset, and this is something new. This has been done for the last 2 years. Everybody who has a in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability to view that content as long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription. They can watch that on their mobile handset. We're taking really the strategy in a whole different -- in a different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home and has nothing to do with in-home content. Now some of the content you could watch at home could be on this for like sports that has been very popular in the go90 environment. But we're looking at a lot of different mobile-first, short clips, news, sports, and if you think about it, original content. And if you look at the strategy that we have taken in the last couple of quarters, we've added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home. So if you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create 2 very exclusive channels for us. One is called RatedRed, one is called Seriously.TV. And the target population is 12 to 24. We -- then, as I said in my preambled remarks, AwesomenessTV, we took a 25% ownership stake. Because what we saw was there was certain original content that we had contracted with them, that they deployed in go90, and we saw our viewership really jump when those original contents presented themselves. So this is another one where #1 digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24, 160 million views, up 53% year-over-year. And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days, entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying Complex, 50% owner. This is another #1 digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24, monthly unique viewers of 54 million and over 300 million views per month. So this is really where we're taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than what everyone else is talking about. And we believe that's where we are going to a differentiated brand with go90 and AOL and everything else that we're doing around that video platform. So that's kind of where we're at on that. On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration of that based on the, what I'll call, the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out, and we start to see accretion at the backend of '17. And we run a number of models, and we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we are at, at this point in time."

Thanks, Amir. So first one, on just the CapEx. Look, there's some timing here, and the reason that is, is because if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend really in Wireless to prepare for the Super Bowl, and that was a whole densification project on the West Coast around San Francisco and Santa Clara. So really what you're seeing here is, is a timing issue. We are right on track with our plans on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells. So there is nothing that I'm going to say here that should concern you about our plans, and you'll see us catch up on that spend in the second and through to third and the fourth quarter. So coming in right on guidance. Now the only thing I will say here is keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier, that will disappear in the second quarter. So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past, but again, right on track with where we thought we would be. On the 5G question, look, we are committed to being the first U.S. company to roll out 5G Wireless technology. We are currently, what I would call, doing sandbox, sandboxes and creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G technology forum, which includes all the major OEMs and handset OEMs. We will involve -- evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE, to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation. Currently, we're testing 5G technology this year, and we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilot starting in 2017. And I want to reiterate that. This is a fixed wireless, which is really one of the first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile, it's really around fixed wireless. We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz, and we're working with the FCC. And as you know, with XO, we have the ability for an option to buy around the 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're doing our testing right now. And then keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G, so this is not a capital-intense overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about high-speed video delivery over a wireless network in a very, very efficient way. And you should think about 5G again like we did with LTE, where you see those 4 to 5 incremental cost decreases when delivering that video, that's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment. So right now, that's where we're at, but we continue to plow forward, and we will be ready to go with the 5G technology."

Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in the filings with the SEC. 
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $1.06 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. 
Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $142 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, the loss and settlement accounting amounted to $102 million or $0.02 per share and the gain on the spectrum transaction amounted to $88 million or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other. Including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per share of $1.06 in the first quarter compared to $1.02 per share a year ago or a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the first quarter of 2015.
As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the 3 states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pretax or about $0.03 per share due to these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pretax benefit or $0.02 per share that we recognized in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior-period results.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our 3-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve; develop new business models through global platforms and video and Internet",3536,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our 3-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve; develop new business models through global platforms and video and Internet of Things; and create incremental revenue opportunities and applications and content. In terms of progress on this multi-tier strategy, we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency, while we develop new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally.
We are also developing a portfolio of unique content targeted at the millennial generation, so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile. At the network connectivity layer, we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. Having the best network does matter, as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later.
We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage and implementing a number of optimization techniques, such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year. Over the long term, densification of our Wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage these growing consumption trends, as well as to preposition ourselves for the 5G technology of the future. A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber.
During the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications, which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide, as well as to lease millimeter wave spectrum for 5G testing purposes with the option to buy. We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston that will support wireless and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network-efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility to innovate, develop and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets.
In terms of 5G, our technical testing is going well, and there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G forum to prepare for fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year.
Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business and are making progress in driving efficiencies, reducing overhead costs and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that have already been taken and others that we plan to implement for 2016 and beyond.
In the fourth quarter 2015, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first quarter. Overall, consolidated headcount since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3% as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016.
We continue to streamline business support functions utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive consistency and improve speed of delivery in the market. Across Wireless, we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the store operations, call center operations and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model while improving the overall customer experience.
Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs. Always more work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress.
Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue stream through new ecosystems, platforms, content and solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens.
The video platform continues to expand as we add more unique content that appeals to millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing 2 initial channels of video programming targeting the digital millennial audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms. 
Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire an equity stake in AwesomenessTV and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on go90. Just over the past few days, we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investments in AwesomenessTV and Complex Media position us as partial owners in the #1 digital media brands for young millennials.
On the go90 application, we remain encouraged by the viewership of go90. But as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining traction and engagement. 
Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts and original series content within go90 on their mobile devices and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our FreeBee Data service. We look forward to expanding our go90 content to other media through our AOL brands and the web later this year.
Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, we continue to develop platforms and our network to take advantage of the opportunities to innovate and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic and business challenges. We have launched our own utility, transportation and healthcare solutions with products like Networkfleet, Grid Wide, Verizon Share, hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent Track and Trace. Our ThinkSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster and more accessible to develop applications.
New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of about 25%. While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority.
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter. Earnings per share grew 3.9% and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders. 
Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. AOL had its best first quarter revenues in the last 5 years, driven by growth in the platform layer. If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower Wireless phone activations on the device installment sales, lower upgrades and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing. In Wireline, the higher growth of Internet-only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. 
As we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile. Consistent with the prior year, consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion, and our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven by our ability to manage cost and expand margin, even with the pressure on the top line.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operation totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations. We continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping the securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $4 billion. 
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was a result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net debt of $104 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x. 
We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pretax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the current quarter. In early April, we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt balance.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled 640,000 in a seasonally low-volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections including IoT. Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter as compared to a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year, driven by customer retention. Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. 
We have taken many actions to improve and simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction. We ended the quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds, we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in phone net adds were basic devices. Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product, which we introduced last year. Net prepaid devices declined by 177,000.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base. As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrades in the first quarter. About 5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points.
Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on Slide 9. In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7% and had an EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter to $22 billion. Service revenue was $16.8 billion, declined 6.2% for the quarter as a result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan. As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline midyear when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year, we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of 2017.
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter compared with about 67% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70% due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which contributed to lower equipment revenue growth. We expect the second quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%. During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass Markets, which includes small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter, Fios total revenue grew 5%, with consumer Fios revenue growing at 4.7%. The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the Fios growth. At the end of the quarter, about 78% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident as about 60% of our consumer FiOS Internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits and above. FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband, we added 98,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter.
The consumer revenue growth trajectory continues to decline as customers downsize their existing bundles and core voice services are no longer desired. We introduced the next generation of our Custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content and value provided by the original Custom TV offer to appeal to even wider range of value-conscious customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an Essentials plan and a Sports & More plan, with the option to select up to 3 additional packs. The demand for Custom TV remained strong, and during the first quarter, Custom TV represented about 38% of our FiOS Video sales. Due to the lower PRICE of the bundle and the lower content cost associated with the Custom TV, a Custom TV customer generates less revenue, but contributes more margin than the traditional FiOS Video customer.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant-currency basis. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant-currency basis, it was down about 2.6%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both enterprise and global wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results.
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment post the Frontier transaction. Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated with these 3 markets will be included in Corporate and Other, beginning with the second quarter results. For illustrative purposes, on a preliminary basis, we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide 9 quarters of recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the 3 markets later in the second quarter. 
Recast total revenue for the first quarter 2016, excluding these 3 markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year. As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with our fiber infrastructure and Fios products. Recast Wireline margin, excluding these markets, decreased as expected since these properties were more profitable than the properties that remained. Without these properties, the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately 19%. 
We have been working on our post-Frontier transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated before, we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded cost at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
Let's move next to Slide 13 for an overview of our liability management. Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion, and at the end of the first quarter 2016, our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter 2016. In early April 2016, we utilized Frontier proceeds plus cash on hand to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face-value debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher-cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future. 
The Frontier-related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half of 2016 and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September, are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan. Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018 to 2019 time frame. At the same time, we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt profile and returned value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each year.
Let's move next to Slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities. We are off to a strong start in 2016 as we executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers, delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and on further developing new ecosystems. 
At the operational level, we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline revenues, improving our overall cost structure and ramping new revenue streams. At this point in the year, we continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations, we may need to update the full year guidance at a later time.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Well, I mean, Boston is a unique situation. So we announced the intent to extend Fios in Boston. Understand that the LFA has to be negotiated with City Council, and that is a public process that will take approximately 6 months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework, but we need to go through that process. It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G. So obviously, when we looked at Boston, it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we looked at all of our current COs around the footprint and the fiber that we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say we can do the fiber buildout to expand the LTE densification, but we also can use this opportunity with only an increment of about $300 million over the next 5 to 6 years to expand our Fios footprint. So the $300 million, you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers, it's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent regardless of whether we expanded Fios. So we will get to this, but we are starting to -- we will start this midyear this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the Internet capability with passing homes. But for the video product, we will have to wait to go through the LFA City Council process."

All right, so on guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. A",705,"Sure. Thanks, Simon. All right, so on guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. And just to set the record here, I mean, again, we did not give revenue guidance, we gave EBITDA margin percent guidance, and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015. So if you step back a second and look at earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our assets held for sale, so really, the comparable number is $3.86. And as we said, we felt good about growing earnings back to that $3.99 through our normal operation results of the business. So if you take that fourth quarter and move it forward for the first quarter, $1.06, that would mean we're $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04, which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. So if you start out your baseline from last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken right off the top for that. And then as we talked, there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded cost. And again, I want to reiterate that we've always said that the stranded cost would be offset on a consolidated basis, not within total Wireline segment. So we do have some timing here. We're looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute and offset some of the stranded costs. So you can see we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis. But other things that we're looking at is around distribution centers, in call centers. As you know, call centers are a very high turnover rate for employees. And with our decreasing calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not hire as many customer call centers, and we'll achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call centers. So there's opportunity to reduce force just through the attrition rate. And then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiencies that we gain there. So as we look at this, there will be some timing. So Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04, but we're looking at -- we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the other things we're doing. Now finally, obviously, on this, the timing of the union agreement, we have planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we will come back in midyear. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning shareholder value to our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully, that clears it up a little bit. On the second question or the second part of your question around the strike, at this point, it's too early to tell the impacts. I mean, we've deployed thousands of management employees to take on the work. We, obviously, always during this period of time, fall a little bit behind on the install work. We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective, so there's a little bit of a backlog there, and we'll just have to work through this. But right now, really no financial impact per se in the second quarter that I'm anticipating, unless this drags on for a much longer period of time. On the data center sale, look, I mean this is still -- I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on, but nothing at this point that I'm prepared to announce in a public forum, but we continue to explore that activity."

You highlight that you if you hadn't had the Frontier benefit last year, the earnings would have been more like $3.86. But if I do the math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset, the earnings would be reasonably materially higher. And my math is that the year-over-year earnings power of Verizon, had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here, would have been about 10%. And Street estimates are really only looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on kind of what you see is the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as we kind of think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for a second? And then just the second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter, but obviously, reports are that it's been lower than normal. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see the cadence for the shape of the year with the iPhone 7 likely coming out in the back part of the year and kind of the amount of upgrades you'd see kind of by that point in time?"

So on earnings, look, I mean, we've been pretty open about 2016, and of course, we've got a lot of things going in a lot of different directions. I mean, obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're still increasing the profitability of that business, and it's really the recurring revenue that we're focused in on and the quality of our customers. On the Wireline side of the house, again, you see there's pressure on top line because of Custom TV and Internet-only now versus triple play. But again, we're improving the profitability of that business. So for this year, we'll stick with what we talked about on guidance. Mike and I have been pretty open and Lowell have been pretty open about '17. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in '17. But I would not attribute this to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio, that's putting pressure on some of the bottom line. So I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture. I mean, we've got a really good value for that, that we're going to put the cash to work, that really benefits the earnings power of this company, and that's the way I look at it. On the upgrade rate, look, I mean, if you look at year-over-year, we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate, and obviously, that had a lot of impact on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we're seeing is our embedded base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter of 70% and fell short to 68%. So if you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, I mean, you would think that the stronger uptake and device installment plan will drive more margin, but, in fact, we missed that metric. We did lower and we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving parts here. But to your question of where do I think upgrade rates are going to go, at this point, based on what we know, we think that upgrade rates will be relatively the same as '15. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at this point in time."

So on FCC special access, look, the FCC will take action this month some time on special access rulemaking, and it's tariff investigation of the certain discounts that we and other large legacy providers offer for the DS1s and 3s.

Our top priority, though, is to ensure that our business services are on a level playing field with all the other competitors, including cable companies. We intend to work with the industry and the FCC to develop a framework for that, that applies to all competitors equally and relies on the sound public policy to determine where and when regulation is appropriate. So we'll wait to see what the FCC does here, Phil, and then we'll respond accordingly.

So on the investment side, look, I mean we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A- rated company, and we're on track to do that. In everything we do, that continues to be the top priority. So even with all of the M&A activity you've seen, I mean, if you look back, we started this at our pre-Vodafone debt of -- post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to $109 billion. But keep in mind, that was with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time. That was with $4 billion of purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase, and now we've just sold the Frontier properties that helps bring that debt down even to a lower level. So we are right on course, but that is top-of-mind at everything that we do and will continue to be a commitment that Lo and I made, that is forefront that we will commit to. On the AOL performance, look, I think I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL, but look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the last 5 years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year-over-year. Now, of course, that's seasonal, but that's shows you, though, that the investments that we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in-type investments that we made with acquisitions, and these are small acquisitions, but they're real critical. I mean, if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with RYOT, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post, for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news. But again, this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that, quite honestly, Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition, it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform. The other thing you're going to see us do this year, too, is around go90. The go90 product will start cross all of the AOL platforms this year. That is going to enhance both the AOL platforms, and it's also going to enhance the go90 platform. So look, continuing with our strategy, we will -- as I said before, we will open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this. And I continue to say that, that will be midyear to maybe third quarter of this year where we'll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms that we talk about."

We think that sponsored data and other FreeBee Data programs are good for the consumer, and that regulators will recognize that after concluding their review on our product. So based on the zero data, we'll have to wait and see where they come out on that. As far as Title II goes, look, I mean, we agree with all the principles with net neutrality rule. The thing that we disagreed with and opposed was applying Title II to broadband services and particularly wireless broadband. So we'll have to see where this comes out. But in reclassing broadband under Title II was not necessary to ensure an open Internet. I mean, there's been nothing ever that shows that this not has been an open Internet. So this will obviously have some negative consequences on innovation as a whole. But look, I mean, we're a company that has operated under regulation for 100 years and has been very successful. So we'll wait to see what the FCC concludes and then we'll operate accordingly, but it's too early to say what exactly is going to happen here."

I mean, we now have 48% of our base over on the new pricing, and we continue to push for that. So you saw the 7 basis point increase in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say, though is, is if you look ahead, last year second quarter, the churn was like 0.90. I would not anticipate nor should you anticipate that, that we will achieve that churn rates again because things have kind of flattened out now. So I would look at the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective. And part of that is, is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before where we gave a free tablet away, and we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. And they signed up for the 2-year agreement because they got a tablet for $10 a month or $240, and they disconnected it at the end of the agreement. So we stopped doing that promotion for that reason, but you see some of these tablets now coming up on the 2-year deal. So we anticipate that some of that higher churn in that tablet environment will hit us over the next couple of quarters. So we should be prepared for that. But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate, overall. So I think that's really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we're dedicating all of our concentration in our promos. On the prepaid side, absolutely. I mean, our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for a whole host of reasons, and it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high-quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product. If you look at the competitive nature, they're doing it with sub brands, they're not really doing it with their brands. And quite honestly, we use the TracFone brand as our prepaid product. And TracFone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller, but it continues to increase on the high-quality base of TracFone. So that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market. More to come on this during the year, but currently, that's how we operate under the prepaid model."

So on the video landscape, look, I mean I think we've set the bar on where we're going on video, both in the home and outside the home. So in the home, we were the first to come out with our Custom TV package, which rebundled certain content, and it's been very successful. I mean, this quarter, even with the rebundle of Custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle. And what I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top line pressure because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective, but the content cost is considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us. So it's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch 17 on average. So we're trying to give customers what they want. And that's a fight, obviously, with all the content providers, but we're doing it within the legality of our contracts. And of course, we won't breach any of our contracts. But it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any approach to our in-home delivery. The other thing is, is there's confusion out there on the video side, which is everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset, and this is something new. This has been done for the last 2 years. Everybody who has a in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability to view that content. As long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription, they can watch that on their mobile handset. We're taking really the strategy in a whole different -- in a different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home. It has nothing to do with in-home content. Now some of the content you could watch at home could be on this for like sports that has been very popular in the go90 environment. But we're looking at a lot of different mobile-first, short clips, news, sports, and if you think about it, original content. And if you look at the strategy that we have taken in the last couple of quarters, we've added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home. So if you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create 2 very exclusive channels for us. One is called RatedRed, one is called Seriously.TV. And the target population is 12 to 24. We -- then, as I said in my preambled remarks, AwesomenessTV, we took a 25% ownership stake. Because what we saw was there was certain original content that we had contracted with them, that they deployed in go90, and we saw viewership really jump when those original contents presented themselves. So this is another one where #1 digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24, 160 million views, up 53% year-over-year. And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days, entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying Complex, 50% owner. This is another #1 digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24, monthly unique viewers of 54 million and over 300 million views per month. So this is really where we're taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than what everyone else is talking about. And we believe that's where we are going to be a differentiated brand with go90 and AOL and everything else that we're doing around that video platform. So that's kind of where we're at on that. On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration of that base on the -- what I'll call, the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out, and we start to see accretion at the backend of '17. And we've run a number of models, and we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we're at, at this point in time."

In the near term, as you mentioned, your CapEx was down high single digits during the quarter, but you remain fully committed towards your guidance levels. What initiatives are top of mind for what seems to be an implied improving spending trajectory through the year? And I guess, longer term, I was wondering if you could briefly discuss some of your initiatives on 5G. You folks clearly seem to be pushing a timeline that is well ahead of your domestic peers and most of the global players as well. What is the impetus for this focus? And in order to meet the time when you expect, what type of assets do you think you need to ensure to be able to get to meet those expectations? Should we expect additional deals like XO or some organic investments in fiber or anything along those lines?"

So first, on just the CapEx. Look, there's some timing here, and the reason that is, is because if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend really in Wireless to prepare for the Super Bow",481,"All right. Thanks, Amir. So first, on just the CapEx. Look, there's some timing here, and the reason that is, is because if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend really in Wireless to prepare for the Super Bowl, and that was a whole densification project on the West Coast around San Francisco and Santa Clara. So really what you're seeing here is, is a timing issue. We are right on track with our plans on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells. So there is nothing that I'm going to say here that should concern you about our plans, and you'll see us catch up on that spend in the second and through to third and the fourth quarter, so coming in right on guidance. Now the only thing I will say here is keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier that will disappear in the second quarter. So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past, but again, right on track with where we thought we would be. On the 5G question, look, we are committed to being the first U.S. company to roll out 5G Wireless technology. We are currently, what I would call, doing sandbox, sandboxes and creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G technology forum, which includes all the major OEMs and handset OEMs. We will involve -- evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE, to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation. Currently, we're testing 5G technology this year, and we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilot starting in 2017. And I want to reiterate that. This is a fixed wireless, which is really one of the first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile; it's really around fixed wireless. We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz, and we're working with the FCC. And as you know, with XO, we have the ability for an option to buy around the 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're doing our testing right now. And then, keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G, so this is not a capital-intense overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about high-speed video delivery over a wireless network in a very, very efficient way. And you should think about 5G, again like we did with LTE, where you see those 4 to 5 incremental cost decreases when delivering that video, that's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment. So right now, that's where we're at, but we continue to plow forward, and we will be ready to go with the 5G technology."

This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.
Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the Investor Quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in the filings with the SEC. 
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $1.06 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. 
Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $142 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, the loss and settlement accounting amounted to $102 million or $0.02 per share and the gain on the spectrum transaction amounted to $88 million or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other. Including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per share of $1.06 in the first quarter compared to $1.02 per share a year ago or a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the first quarter of 2015.
As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the 3 states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pretax or about $0.03 per share due to these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pretax benefit or $0.02 per share that we recognized in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior-period results.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our 3-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve; develop new business models through global platforms and video and Internet",3536,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our 3-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve; develop new business models through global platforms and video and Internet of Things; and create incremental revenue opportunities and applications and content. In terms of progress on this multi-tier strategy, we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency, while we develop new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally.
We are also developing a portfolio of unique content targeted at the millennial generation, so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile. At the network connectivity layer, we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. Having the best network does matter, as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later.
We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage and implementing a number of optimization techniques, such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year. Over the long term, densification of our Wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage these growing consumption trends, as well as to preposition ourselves for the 5G technology of the future. A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber.
During the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications, which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide, as well as to lease millimeter wave spectrum for 5G testing purposes with the option to buy. We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston that will support wireless and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network-efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility to innovate, develop and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets.
In terms of 5G, our technical testing is going well, and there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G forum to prepare for fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year.
Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business and are making progress in driving efficiencies, reducing overhead costs and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that have already been taken and others that we plan to implement for 2016 and beyond.
In the fourth quarter 2015, we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first quarter. Overall, consolidated headcount since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3% as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016.
We continue to streamline business support functions utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive consistency and improve speed of delivery in the market. Across Wireless, we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the store operations, call center operations and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model while improving the overall customer experience.
Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs. Always more work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress.
Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue stream through new ecosystems, platforms, content and solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens.
The video platform continues to expand as we add more unique content that appeals to millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing 2 initial channels of video programming targeting the digital millennial audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms. 
Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire an equity stake in AwesomenessTV and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on go90. Just over the past few days, we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investments in AwesomenessTV and Complex Media position us as partial owners in the #1 digital media brands for young millennials.
On the go90 application, we remain encouraged by the viewership of go90. But as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining traction and engagement. 
Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts and original series content within go90 on their mobile devices and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our FreeBee Data service. We look forward to expanding our go90 content to other media through our AOL brands and the web later this year.
Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, we continue to develop platforms and our network to take advantage of the opportunities to innovate and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic and business challenges. We have launched our own utility, transportation and healthcare solutions with products like Networkfleet, Grid Wide, Verizon Share, hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent Track and Trace. Our ThinkSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster and more accessible to develop applications.
New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of about 25%. While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority.
Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter. Earnings per share grew 3.9% and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders. 
Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. AOL had its best first quarter revenues in the last 5 years, driven by growth in the platform layer. If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower Wireless phone activations on the device installment sales, lower upgrades and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing. In Wireline, the higher growth of Internet-only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. 
As we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile. Consistent with the prior year, consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion, and our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven by our ability to manage cost and expand margin, even with the pressure on the top line.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operation totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations. We continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping the securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $4 billion. 
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was a result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net debt of $104 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x. 
We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pretax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the current quarter. In early April, we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt balance.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled 640,000 in a seasonally low-volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections including IoT. Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter as compared to a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year, driven by customer retention. Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. 
We have taken many actions to improve and simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction. We ended the quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds, we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in phone net adds were basic devices. Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product, which we introduced last year. Net prepaid devices declined by 177,000.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base. As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrades in the first quarter. About 5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points.
Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on Slide 9. In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7% and had an EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter to $22 billion. Service revenue was $16.8 billion, declined 6.2% for the quarter as a result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan. As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline midyear when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year, we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of 2017.
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter compared with about 67% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70% due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which contributed to lower equipment revenue growth. We expect the second quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%. During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter, consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass Markets, which includes small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter, Fios total revenue grew 5%, with consumer Fios revenue growing at 4.7%. The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the Fios growth. At the end of the quarter, about 78% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident as about 60% of our consumer FiOS Internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits and above. FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband, we added 98,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter.
The consumer revenue growth trajectory continues to decline as customers downsize their existing bundles and core voice services are no longer desired. We introduced the next generation of our Custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content and value provided by the original Custom TV offer to appeal to even wider range of value-conscious customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an Essentials plan and a Sports & More plan, with the option to select up to 3 additional packs. The demand for Custom TV remained strong, and during the first quarter, Custom TV represented about 38% of our FiOS Video sales. Due to the lower price of the bundle and the lower content cost associated with the Custom TV, a Custom TV customer generates less revenue, but contributes more margin than the traditional FiOS Video customer.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter. In the enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant-currency basis. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant-currency basis, it was down about 2.6%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both enterprise and global wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results.
Let's move next to Slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment post the Frontier transaction. Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated with these 3 markets will be included in Corporate and Other, beginning with the second quarter results. For illustrative purposes, on a preliminary basis, we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide 9 quarters of recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the 3 markets later in the second quarter. 
Recast total revenue for the first quarter 2016, excluding these 3 markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year. As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with our fiber infrastructure and Fios products. Recast Wireline margin, excluding these markets, decreased as expected since these properties were more profitable than the properties that remained. Without these properties, the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately 19%. 
We have been working on our post-Frontier transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated before, we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded cost at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
Let's move next to Slide 13 for an overview of our liability management. Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion, and at the end of the first quarter 2016, our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter 2016. In early April 2016, we utilized Frontier proceeds plus cash on hand to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face-value debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher-cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future. 
The Frontier-related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half of 2016 and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September, are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan. Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018 to 2019 time frame. At the same time, we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt profile and returned value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each year.
Let's move next to Slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities. We are off to a strong start in 2016 as we executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high-value customers, delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and on further developing new ecosystems. 
At the operational level, we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline revenues, improving our overall cost structure and ramping new revenue streams. At this point in the year, we continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations, we may need to update the full year guidance at a later time.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Well, I mean, Boston is a unique situation. So we announced the intent to extend Fios in Boston. Understand that the LFA has to be negotiated with City Council, and that is a public process that will take approximately 6 months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework, but we need to go through that process. It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G. So obviously, when we looked at Boston, it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we looked at all of our current COs around the footprint and the fiber that we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say we can do the fiber buildout to expand the LTE densification, but we also can use this opportunity with only an increment of about $300 million over the next 5 to 6 years to expand our Fios footprint. So the $300 million, you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers, it's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent regardless of whether we expanded Fios. So we will get to this, but we are starting to -- we will start this midyear this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the Internet capability with passing homes. But for the video product, we will have to wait to go through the LFA City Council process."

All right, so on guidance.

A",705,"Sure. Thanks, Simon. All right, so on guidance. First and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. And just to set the record here, I mean, again, we did not give revenue guidance, we gave EBITDA margin percent guidance, and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015. So if you step back a second and look at earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our assets held for sale, so really, the comparable number is $3.86. And as we said, we felt good about growing earnings back to that $3.99 through our normal operation results of the business. So if you take that fourth quarter and move it forward for the first quarter, $1.06, that would mean we're $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04, which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. So if you start out your baseline from last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken right off the top for that. And then as we talked, there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded cost. And again, I want to reiterate that we've always said that the stranded cost would be offset on a consolidated basis, not within total Wireline segment. So we do have some timing here. We're looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute and offset some of the stranded costs. So you can see we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis. But other things that we're looking at is around distribution centers, in call centers. As you know, call centers are a very high turnover rate for employees. And with our decreasing calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not hire as many customer call centers, and we'll achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call centers. So there's opportunity to reduce force just through the attrition rate. And then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiencies that we gain there. So as we look at this, there will be some timing. So Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04, but we're looking at -- we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the other things we're doing. Now finally, obviously, on this, the timing of the union agreement, we have planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we will come back in midyear. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning shareholder value to our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully, that clears it up a little bit. On the second question or the second part of your question around the strike, at this point, it's too early to tell the impacts. I mean, we've deployed thousands of management employees to take on the work. We, obviously, always during this period of time, fall a little bit behind on the install work. We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective, so there's a little bit of a backlog there, and we'll just have to work through this. But right now, really no financial impact per se in the second quarter that I'm anticipating, unless this drags on for a much longer period of time. On the data center sale, look, I mean this is still -- I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on, but nothing at this point that I'm prepared to announce in a public forum, but we continue to explore that activity."

You highlight that you if you hadn't had the Frontier benefit last year, the earnings would have been more like $3.86. But if I do the math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset, the earnings would be reasonably materially higher. And my math is that the year-over-year earnings power of Verizon, had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here, would have been about 10%. And Street estimates are really only looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on kind of what you see is the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as we kind of think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for a second? And then just the second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter, but obviously, reports are that it's been lower than normal. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see the cadence for the shape of the year with the iPhone 7 likely coming out in the back part of the year and kind of the amount of upgrades you'd see kind of by that point in time?"

So on earnings, look, I mean, we've been pretty open about 2016, and of course, we've got a lot of things going in a lot of different directions. I mean, obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're still increasing the profitability of that business, and it's really the recurring revenue that we're focused in on and the quality of our customers. On the Wireline side of the house, again, you see there's pressure on top line because of Custom TV and Internet-only now versus triple play. But again, we're improving the profitability of that business. So for this year, we'll stick with what we talked about on guidance. Mike and I have been pretty open and Lowell have been pretty open about '17. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in '17. But I would not attribute this to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio, that's putting pressure on some of the bottom line. So I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture. I mean, we've got a really good value for that, that we're going to put the cash to work, that really benefits the earnings power of this company, and that's the way I look at it. On the upgrade rate, look, I mean, if you look at year-over-year, we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate, and obviously, that had a lot of impact on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we're seeing is our embedded base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter of 70% and fell short to 68%. So if you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, I mean, you would think that the stronger uptake and device installment plan will drive more margin, but, in fact, we missed that metric. We did lower and we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving parts here. But to your question of where do I think upgrade rates are going to go, at this point, based on what we know, we think that upgrade rates will be relatively the same as '15. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at this point in time."

So on the investment side, look, I mean we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A- rated company, and we're on track to do that. In everything we do, that continues to be the top priority. So even with all of the M&A activity you've seen, I mean, if you look back, we started this at our pre-Vodafone debt of -- post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to $109 billion. But keep in mind, that was with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time. That was with $4 billion of purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase, and now we've just sold the Frontier properties that helps bring that debt down even to a lower level. So we are right on course, but that is top-of-mind at everything that we do and will continue to be a commitment that Lo and I made, that is forefront that we will commit to. On the AOL performance, look, I think I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL, but look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the last 5 years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year-over-year. Now, of course, that's seasonal, but that's shows you, though, that the investments that we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in-type investments that we made with acquisitions, and these are small acquisitions, but they're real critical. I mean, if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with RYOT, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post, for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news. But again, this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that, quite honestly, Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition, it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform. The other thing you're going to see us do this year, too, is around go90. The go90 product will start cross all of the AOL platforms this year. That is going to enhance both the AOL platforms, and it's also going to enhance the go90 platform. So look, continuing with our strategy, we will -- as I said before, we will open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this. And I continue to say that, that will be midyear to maybe third quarter of this year where we'll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms that we talk about."

So on the competitive environment of Verizon, I mean, look, coming into '15 and again in '16, we said that the top priority would be to maintain the high quality of our base, and you see us doing that. I mean, we now have 48% of our base over on the new pricing, and we continue to push for that. So you saw the 7 basis point increase in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say, though is, is if you look ahead, last year second quarter, the churn was like 0.90. I would not anticipate nor should you anticipate that, that we will achieve that churn rates again because things have kind of flattened out now. So I would look at the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective. And part of that is, is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before where we gave a free tablet away, and we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. And they signed up for the 2-year agreement because they got a tablet for $10 a month or $240, and they disconnected it at the end of the agreement. So we stopped doing that promotion for that reason, but you see some of these tablets now coming up on the 2-year deal. So we anticipate that some of that higher churn in that tablet environment will hit us over the next couple of quarters. So we should be prepared for that. But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate, overall. So I think that's really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we're dedicating all of our concentration in our promos. On the prepaid side, absolutely. I mean, our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for a whole host of reasons, and it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high-quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product. If you look at the competitive nature, they're doing it with sub brands, they're not really doing it with their brands. And quite honestly, we use the TracFone brand as our prepaid product. And TracFone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller, but it continues to increase on the high-quality base of TracFone. So that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market. More to come on this during the year, but currently, that's how we operate under the prepaid model."

So on the video landscape, look, I mean I think we've set the bar on where we're going on video, both in the home and outside the home. So in the home, we were the first to come out with our Custom TV package, which rebundled certain content, and it's been very successful. I mean, this quarter, even with the rebundle of Custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle. And what I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top line pressure because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective, but the content cost is considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us. So it's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch 17 on average. So we're trying to give customers what they want. And that's a fight, obviously, with all the content providers, but we're doing it within the legality of our contracts. And of course, we won't breach any of our contracts. But it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any approach to our in-home delivery. The other thing is, is there's confusion out there on the video side, which is everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset, and this is something new. This has been done for the last 2 years. Everybody who has a in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability to view that content. As long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription, they can watch that on their mobile handset. We're taking really the strategy in a whole different -- in a different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home. It has nothing to do with in-home content. Now some of the content you could watch at home could be on this for like sports that has been very popular in the go90 environment. But we're looking at a lot of different mobile-first, short clips, news, sports, and if you think about it, original content. And if you look at the strategy that we have taken in the last couple of quarters, we've added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home. So if you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create 2 very exclusive channels for us. One is called RatedRed, one is called Seriously.TV. And the target population is 12 to 24. We -- then, as I said in my preambled remarks, AwesomenessTV, we took a 25% ownership stake. Because what we saw was there was certain original content that we had contracted with them, that they deployed in go90, and we saw viewership really jump when those original contents presented themselves. So this is another one where #1 digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24, 160 million views, up 53% year-over-year. And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days, entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying Complex, 50% owner. This is another #1 digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24, monthly unique viewers of 54 million and over 300 million views per month. So this is really where we're taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than what everyone else is talking about. And we believe that's where we are going to be a differentiated brand with go90 and AOL and everything else that we're doing around that video platform. So that's kind of where we're at on that. On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration of that base on the -- what I'll call, the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out, and we start to see accretion at the backend of '17. And we've run a number of models, and we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we're at, at this point in time."

Thanks, Amir. So first, on just the CapEx. Look, there's some timing here, and the reason that is, is because if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend really in Wireless to prepare for the Super Bowl, and that was a whole densification project on the West Coast around San Francisco and Santa Clara. So really what you're seeing here is, is a timing issue. We are right on track with our plans on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells. So there is nothing that I'm going to say here that should concern you about our plans, and you'll see us catch up on that spend in the second and through to third and the fourth quarter, so coming in right on guidance. Now the only thing I will say here is keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier that will disappear in the second quarter. So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past, but again, right on track with where we thought we would be. On the 5G question, look, we are committed to being the first U.S. company to roll out 5G Wireless technology. We are currently, what I would call, doing sandbox, sandboxes and creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G technology forum, which includes all the major OEMs and handset OEMs. We will involve -- evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE, to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation. Currently, we're testing 5G technology this year, and we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilot starting in 2017. And I want to reiterate that. This is a fixed wireless, which is really one of the first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile; it's really around fixed wireless. We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz, and we're working with the FCC. And as you know, with XO, we have the ability for an option to buy around the 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're doing our testing right now. And then, keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G, so this is not a capital-intense overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about high-speed video delivery over a wireless network in a very, very efficient way. And you should think about 5G, again like we did with LTE, where you see those 4 to 5 incremental cost decreases when delivering that video, that's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment. So right now, that's where we're at, but we continue to plow forward, and we will be ready to go with the 5G technology."

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam; and our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo! acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Lowell and Fran goes through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $3.6 billion generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the remeasurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted to $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share. On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employee benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial valuations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year-to-date, unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion.
We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida and Texas wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis, the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter compared with $1.04 per share a year ago or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015. 
Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pretax basis, representing about $0.07 per share. At the wireline segment level before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pretax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share. For purposes of comparability in the wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28, we filed a Form 8-K providing the recast unaudited historical information for the past 9 quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior period results do not include the operations of AOL. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell."

We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with several strategic milestones. We continue to evolve our wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction. We made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes. In addition, yesterday, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo!'s operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media. With everything that's going on, I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world. We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy: first, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platforms through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts. For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies where quality and reliability across the country even with the explosive growth of data usage. Over the last 16 years, we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone, network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in 10-plus years ago in 1 week. In light of this growing demand, we are continuing to invest in and evolve our wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable and highest-quality wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support wireless network growth. 
Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of wireless technology. With 3G, we ushered in the era of wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE, we changed the game for the delivery of wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day.
To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever-increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high-usage areas. We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our wireless network for years to come. Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber optic network platform capable of supporting wireless and wireline technologies and multiple products. In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston, and we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer our discussion solely about local franchise rights but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective. Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeterwave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge. Yesterday, the SEC approved our lease arrangement with XO so that we have a clear spectrum path towards 5G deployment, which like 4G will be a game-changer. I think a 5G initially as an effect wireless fiber, which is wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With wireless fiber, the so-called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities. In our labs, we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like with multiple high-definition TVs, laptops, tablets and virtual reality applications served over a wireless connection delivered at speeds significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeterwave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions. 
Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low-latency services and application. Trade associations are already accelerating their time lines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset equipment and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low-latency applications. To date, we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners, we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation, and we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem. So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the SEC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade. 
Through every generation of technology, our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value and, yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the #1 priority of the company. 
With the other 2 tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas starting with video. As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time, with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years, we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV, new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing Go90 and its vast library of digital content not only for our Verizon customers but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high-quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in 2 leading digital brands for female and male millennials namely: AwesomenessTV and Complex Media. We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition, we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar. 
That brings us to Yahoo!. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by 2 brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space. By acquiring Yahoo!'s operating business, we're scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo!'s operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications, which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands and sport, finance, news and email into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad-tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news and finance to leverage this scale in the future. 
Yahoo!'s operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital-intensive manner. We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo!. In the months ahead, we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future.
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layer. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and above $400 million year-to-date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, Hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market. 
In June, we agreed to acquire Telejuice, which will advance our fleet telematic's connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale. So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance. I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year. 
In Wireless, we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high-quality loyal customer base. Fran is going to cover more of that in a few minutes. 
In Wireline, we completed the sale of 3 properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber. We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impact of the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs. Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree healthcare will be realized. We've preserved the bargain forecast on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefit, which when netted with other post-retirement benefit changes, reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter. I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remain strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning, but our commitment to placing customers first in our business. I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally. 
Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always, we're focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program.
So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast-moving, challenging environment and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade. 
Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5."
415798,364940734,1011778,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, w",2070,"Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis. 
AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. In Wireless, service revenue, as expected, was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future. 
Let's turn no to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing payment receivables and an increase in cash taxes. Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter or retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure. 
Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion with which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on-balance sheet securitization with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public were 144A on balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provide several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing cost with AAA rating. Favorable captive finance treatment from 2 credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on-balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated, and debt will also reflect the new securitization financing. Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on-balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations and, therefore, lower free cash flow but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter. 
Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago as certain benefits that we realized in the prior year period did not recur, and timing of tax deductions for early debt retirement vary. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion. Our discipline capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. 
We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.  Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plan, the decline has flattened as expected now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plan to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality. As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on, and we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter compared with about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We've recognized that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point, it is too early to forecast any changes. 
During the quarter, 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we had about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8% and had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago. 
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices. Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. While other postpaid devices, totaling 173,000, were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail home devices being the primary driver. Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement significantly and from the prior year due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn stemming from the pre-tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year. 
We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3%; and Mass Markets, which include small business, declined 1.2% on the comparable basis, excluding the property sold through Frontier. Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong even with the work stoppage and a high prior year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our FiOS Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our Custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter. 
In Fios video, net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet net adds were negative 13,000, and net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing a decline of 90 basis points. FiOS Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total.  Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on constant currency basis, decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remain consistent with prior periods. Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pretax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment. In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritize maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to more normal operations after work stoppage. 
Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year on Wireless, we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue decline. In Wireline, we completed the sale of the operations at California, Florida and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts, which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve, and we are setting the business up for growth. In our new businesses, we enhanced our video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do and the acquisition of Yahoo! to accelerate our video platforms. As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations: full year adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion; a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million; and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth and consolidated revenue for the full year 2017. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

First, on Yahoo! synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably, we were the only significant bidder that had synergies, so we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around the that are in the ballpark. But my view on this, John, as we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information, and we'll validate our plans and make our decision. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way. On the -- do we have the assets we need? Certainly, yesterday, when Marnie and Tim did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo! has in the areas boards and finance and email and news. And you match those up with AOL, we just made an exponential leap in capabilities here. But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital, and you say, ""Well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital?"" And my answer always is, I hope not because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment. We should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs. And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa put their heads together, we'll have a long list, and we'll be disciplined as we always are, and there'll be good investments that will drive us to take a larger share of this growing market. So there's been a lot made of, oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process? I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market, and this will be a success for us and we certainly expect to do better than that."

So on handset cycles, so 2 real points here. One is, obviously, we saw a similar trend, maybe not this dramatic in '14 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that. Unfortunately, for us, though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary, and there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going hold their phone and make a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone. So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter, and that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015. As far as the how do we stimulate phone smartphone growth. Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow, and we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously tablets being one, and we have a little bit of a headwind there. But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over 1 million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that pre-tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago, and we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of Hum and you look at the other ads that we did, these are the types of devices that be want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall. And if you look at the underlying [indiscernible] which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you're not seeing it in the results because the math of moving from the subsidized of the unsubsidized is a declining math. The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis improvement on service revenue. And as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse. So an 80 basis point this quarter, I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter because of the new pricing in some of the optimization, but we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of '17, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of the '17. Finally, on the data center sales. We are coming to the end of the process, and we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that."

Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got the perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas. First, in the sports area. As you know, we've got relationships with a lot of the big the. Certainly, NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adams Silver in the last few weeks about this, and I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months, you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with. Some of the other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet, but the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights, and we can work on streaming their games not only through the traditional channels of Fios either Custom TV or the full bundle, but over AOL and Yahoo! and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties. The next one is Yahoo! Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly, some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions. And then certainly, news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post, and we can drive a lot of visits to the site. So I think the difference for us is we have a lot of -- us versus the Yahoo! management, we have a lot of the relationships well established because of our Fios in our mobile assets and we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good line up here. So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know any comments you have on that. But that's what we are from a strategic perspective, Mike."

Let me go first on the spectrum side, and then Fran can cover the first part of your question about the growth rates. Today, just to say that about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward and expect that we've got plenty of headroom here. The point of my comments in Boston is a good example there. The farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade-off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were -- that the spectrum was demanding. At the Super Bowl last year, we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that the thesis was correct, that we're actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now, it will further solidify that opinion. And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets was up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeterwave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday because now we have a clear feel in front of us to not only densify with 4G but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here."

Obviously, what we've talked around service revenue plays a big factor in this and the comps year-over-year. But we believe some of these other things start to really start to generate some top line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate now. We see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe, once we get through the churn headwind of a pre-promo, that would become a bigger computing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that, but we're pretty confident on that GDP growth. And then on the bottom line, all I've said, I've never given a percentage, but all I said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate and then, of course, the prior year which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said, and we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year."

What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia. We typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less because of the combined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed, we've been able to put up 6 ultra-high definition TVs, 6 virtual reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So in those services, our only drawing in this 300 to 400 meg of throughput. so lots of headroom. Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment where we can cover a 200 home development and see with normal vegetation with difference in weather patterns where we think this these critical parameters are going to go. Theoretically, what's 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable, but again, we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some real environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along. From a pure cost perspective, again, I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is, about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today, and the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop. And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same, and remember, we wouldn't have to have an ONTE as we think about it today, so as the -- when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than ONTE and router combination today and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction. But we'll know a lot more as we finish of these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of the media to the field to take a look at these deployment so you can judge for yourself."

So traditionally, you would say, well, a tablet added to wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue and that's far in less than a smartphone, and all that is true. But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we're developing here, more people who have tablets we know watch more video on a tablet. And if you think about what whole outline on our whole video strategy along with go90 AOL, Yahoo! coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices and we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments, if you will, more from a holistic standpoint. So yes, I mean, today, it's 11.4% of base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going, and that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, mediaco-type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising."

And then just as we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated, it used to be differentiated on the reliability of voice. More recently, it's been the reality of of data and data speeds.

I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't #1 have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter, and all you have to do is look at the churn. And I'd argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter if you had to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally, advertisements are out there aren't completely truthful, but that's the world that we live in. As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other -- I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but can you hear me now has really moved to can you see me now. And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to just rides the data stream. And so the throughput, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon and I'd argue throughout the history of Wireless is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity. Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here, and we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving the densification and using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade."

If you look at Tim's numbers, he's in the hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo! is well over 1 billion users, so you start putting those numbers together, and there's some significant reach here. I think every content provider, and I think it's fair to say whether you're an advocate for the 300-channel bundle or over-the-top, you realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo! gives them the ability to reach those specific customers. If you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male millennial. And AwesomenessTV has same sort of numbers for female millennials. So it gives whether you're thinking your part of a large network sports distribution or you're the actual league or you're trying to deliver finance or other news, being able to tap into that is a huge opportunity.

Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo! acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $3.6 billion generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the remeasurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted to $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share. On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employee benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial valuations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year-to-date, unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion.
We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida and Texas Wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis, the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter compared with $1.04 per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015.
Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pretax basis, representing about $0.07 per share. At the Wireline segment level before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pretax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28, we filed a Form 8-K providing the recast unaudited historical information for the past 9 quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior period results do not include the operations of AOL.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell."

We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with several strategic milestones: We continued to evolve our wireless pricing model and customer interface, we closed the Frontier t",2299,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with several strategic milestones: We continued to evolve our wireless pricing model and customer interface, we closed the Frontier transaction, we made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes. In addition, yesterday, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo!'s operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media.
With everything that's going on, I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world. We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy: first, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platforms through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts. For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, even with the explosive growth of data usage. Over the last 16 years, we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone, network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in 10-plus years ago in 1 week. In light of this growing demand, we are continuing to invest in and evolve our wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable and highest-quality wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support wireless network growth.
Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of wireless technology. With 3G, we ushered in the era of wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE, we changed the game for the delivery of wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day.
To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever-increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high-usage areas. We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our wireless network for years to come. Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber-optic network platform capable of supporting wireless and wireline technologies and multiple products. In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston, and we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer our discussion solely about local franchise rights but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective. Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge. Yesterday, the FCC approved our lease arrangement with XO so that we have a clear spectrum path towards 5G deployment, which like 4G will be a game-changer. I think of 5G initially as an effect wireless fiber, which is wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With wireless fiber, the so-called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities. In our labs, we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like with multiple high-definition TVs, laptops, tablets and virtual reality applications served over a wireless connection delivered at speed significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions.
Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low-latency services and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their time lines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset equipment and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low-latency applications. To date, we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners, we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation, and we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem. So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the SEC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade.
Through every generation of technology, our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value and, yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the #1 priority of the company.
With the other 2 tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas starting with video. As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time, with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years, we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV, new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content not only for our Verizon customers but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high-quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in 2 leading digital brands for female and male millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media. We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition, we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar.
That brings us to Yahoo!. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by 2 brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space. By acquiring Yahoo!'s operating business, we're scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo!'s operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications, which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands and sports, finance, news and email into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad-tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news and finance to leverage this scale in the future.
Yahoo!'s operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital-intensive manner. We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo!. In the months ahead, we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future.
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and above $400 million year-to-date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market.
In June, we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematic's connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale. So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance. I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year.
In Wireless, we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high-quality loyal customer base. Fran's going to cover more of that in a few minutes.
In Wireline, we completed the sale of 3 properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber. We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs. Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree health care will be realized. We've preserved the [indiscernible] on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefit, which, when netted with other post-retirement benefit changes, reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter. I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remain strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning, but our commitment to placing customers first in our business. I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally.
Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always, we are focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program.
So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast-moving, challenging environment and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade.
Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5."
415798,364940734,1012255,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, w",2070,"Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis.
AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. In Wireless, service revenue, as expected, was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn no to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables and an increase in cash taxes. Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter were retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure.
Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion with which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on-balance sheet securitization with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public for 144A on-balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing cost with AAA rating. Favorable captive finance treatment from 2 credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on-balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated, and debt will also reflect new securitization financing. Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on-balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations and, therefore, lower free cash flow, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter.
Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago as certain benefits that we realized in the prior year period did not recur and timing of tax deductions for early debt retirement varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion. Our discipline capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 time frame.
Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality. As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on, and we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter compared with about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We've recognized that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point, it is too early to forecast any changes.
During the quarter, 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we had about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8% and had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago.
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices. Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices, totaling 173,000, were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn, stemming from the free tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year.
We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and Mass Markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3%; and Mass Markets, which includes small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding the property sold through Frontier. Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong even with the work stoppage and a high prior year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speed. Approximately 11% of our FiOS Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our Custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter.
In Fios video, net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. FiOS Internet net adds were negative 13,000, and net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing a decline of 90 basis points. FiOS Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total.  Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on constant currency basis, decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remain consistent with prior periods. Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pretax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment. In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to normal operations after work stoppage.
Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year on Wireless, we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue decline. In Wireline, we completed the sale of the operations in California, Florida and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve, and we are setting the business up for growth. In our new businesses, we enhanced our video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do and the acquisition of Yahoo! to accelerate our video platforms. As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations: full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion; a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million; and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full year 2017.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

First, on Yahoo! synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies, so we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark. But my view on this, John, as we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information, and we'll validate our plans and make our decision. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way. On the -- do we have the assets we need? Certainly, yesterday, when Marni and Tim did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo! has in the areas of sports and finance and email and news, and you match those up with AOL, we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here. But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital, and you say, ""Well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital?"" And my answer always is, I hope not because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment. We should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs. And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa put their heads together, we'll have a long list, and we'll be disciplined as we always are, and there'll be good investments that will drive us to take a larger share of this growing market. So there's been a lot made of, ""oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process?"" I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will be a success for us, and we certainly expect to do better than that."

Thanks, Simon. So on handset cycles, so 2 real points here. One is, obviously, we saw a similar trend, maybe not this dramatic in '14 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that. Unfortunately, for us, though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary, and there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone. So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter, and that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015. As far as the -- how do we stimulate phone -- smartphone growth. Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow, and we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously, tablets being one, and we have a little bit of a headwind there. But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over 1 million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that free tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago, and we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other ads that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall. And if you look at the underlying IARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you are not seeing it in the results because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is a declining math. The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis improvement on service revenue and as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark, and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse. So an 80 basis point this quarter, I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter because of the new pricing in some of the optimization, but we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of '17, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of '17. Finally, on the data center sales, we are coming to the end of the process, and we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that."

Or can you give us little more color on how you look to maybe manage them differently than they've been managed in the past?

Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas. First, in the sports area. As you know, we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues, certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this, and I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months, you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with. Some of the other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet, but the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights, and we can work on streaming their games not only through the traditional channels of Fios either Custom TV or the full bundle, but over AOL and Yahoo! and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties. The next one is Yahoo! Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly, some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions. And then certainly, news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post, and we can drive a lot of visits to the site. So I think the difference for us is we have a lot of -- us versus the Yahoo! management, we have a lot of the relationships well established because of our Fios and our mobile assets, and we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good line up here. So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know any comments you have on that. But that's where we are ahead from a strategic perspective, Mike."

And then second, just I think in Lowell's commentary, you kind of referenced a view that spectrum is not necessarily the be-all, end-all for creating capacity at the margin. In the notes out this morning, you noted that 93% of the data traffic is of LTE capacity. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE and how much is still available to be tapped to kind of continue to support that 40-plus percent growth rate in consumption?"

Let me go first on the spectrum side, and then Fran can cover the first part of your question about the growth rates. Today, just to say that about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward and expect that we've got plenty of headroom here. The point of my comments in Boston as our good example there is the farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade-off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were -- that the spectrum was demanding. At the Super Bowl last year, we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that the thesis was correct, we're actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion. And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday because now we have a clear feel in front of us to not only densify with 4G but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here."

But we believe some of these other things start to really start to generate some top line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate. Now we see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe, once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that, but we're pretty confident on that GDP growth. And then on the bottom line, all I've said -- I've never given a percentage, but all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate and then, of course, the prior year which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said, and we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year."

What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia. We've typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less because of the combined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed, we've been able to put up 6 ultra-high definition TVs, 6 virtual reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So in those services, our only drawing in the 300 to 400 meg of throughput. So lots of headroom. Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment where we can cover a 200 home development and see, with normal vegetation with difference in weather patterns, where we think this -- these critical parameters are going to go. Theoretically, looks -- 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable, but again, we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along. From a pure cost perspective, again, I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is, about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today, and the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop. And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same, and remember we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today, so as the -- when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than an ONT and router combination today and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction. But we'll know a lot more as we finish these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of the media to the field to take a look at these deployment so that you can judge for yourself."

So traditionally, you would say, well, a tablet that's added to a wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue and that's far less than a smartphone and all that is true. But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we're developing here, more people who have tablets we know watch more video on a tablet. And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy along with go90, AOL, Yahoo! coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices, and we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments, if you will, more from a holistic standpoint. So yes, I mean, today, it's 11.4% of the base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going, and that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, mediaco-type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising."

As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other -- I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but can you hear me now has really moved to can you see me now. And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to just rides the data stream. And so the throughput, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon and I'd argue throughout the history of Wireless is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity. Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here, and we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving the densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade."

If you look at Tim's numbers, he's in the hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo! is well over 1 billion users, so you start putting those numbers together, and there's some significant reach here. I think every content provider, and I think it's fair to say whether you're an advocate for the 300-channel bundle or over the top, you realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo! gives them the ability to reach those specific customers. If you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male millennial and AwesomenessTV has same sort of numbers for female millennials. So it gives whether you're thinking your part of a large network sports distribution or you're the actual league or you're trying to deliver finance or other news. Being able to tap into that is a huge opportunity. The big advertisers have come to us saying that they have more ads to place than they have good places to put them, and so you will hear from us over the next several months, some partnerships and some agreements to place ads with us, and then the final, probably, obvious one to everyone, but we have 113.2 million mobile users, and people are accessing all of this content via their mobile device. And we'll be one of the few that can deliver advertising and content across the home, across the mobile device and across the Internet. And we think that puts us in a very, very strong position."

Before we end, I just want to make sure we have a few points that don't get lost. The team is very focused on delivering on our fundamental operational execution. We continue to be a leader in network quality and customer loyalty and in financial performance. On the strategic front, obviously, we're aggressively building new businesses with revenue and ecosystems that are expanding the industry and enhancing the revenue profile of the company. Certainly, we don't kid ourselves about execution. We've been executing bringing new businesses into the portfolio since we started this back in '99. But just as we have in the past, we're determined to lead the next growth surge and create value for our shareholders. And hopefully, after today, you see that path as clearly as we do.

Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo! acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $3.6 billion generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the remeasurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted to $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share. On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employee benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial valuations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year-to-date, unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion.
We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida and Texas Wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis, the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter compared with $1.04 per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015.
Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pretax basis, representing about $0.07 per share. At the Wireline segment level before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pretax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28, we filed a Form 8-K providing the recast unaudited historical information for the past 9 quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior period results do not include the operations of AOL.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with several strategic milestones.

We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with several strategic milestones. We continued to evolve our wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction, we made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes. In addition, yesterday, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo!'s operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media.
With everything that's going on, I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world. We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy: first, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platforms through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts. For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, even with the explosive growth of data usage. Over the last 16 years, we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone, network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in 10-plus years ago in 1 week. In light of this growing demand, we are continuing to invest in and evolve our wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable and highest-quality wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support wireless network growth.
Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of wireless technology. With 3G, we ushered in the era of wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE, we changed the game for the delivery of wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day.
To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever-increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high-usage areas. We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our wireless network for years to come. Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber-optic network platform capable of supporting wireless and wireline technologies and multiple products. In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston, and we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer are discussions solely about local franchise rights but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective. Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge. Yesterday, the FCC approved our lease arrangement with XO so that we have a clear spectrum path towards 5G deployment, which like 4G will be a game-changer. I think of 5G initially as an effect wireless fiber, which is wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With wireless fiber, the so-called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities. In our labs, we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like with multiple high-definition TVs, laptops, tablets and virtual reality applications served over a wireless connection delivered at speed significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions.
Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low-latency services and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their time lines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset equipment and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low-latency applications. To date, we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners, we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation, and we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem. So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the FCC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade.
Through every generation of technology, our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value and, yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the #1 priority of the company.
With the other 2 tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas starting with video. As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time, with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years, we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV, new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content not only for our Verizon customers but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high-quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in 2 leading digital brands for female and male millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media. We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition, we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar.
That brings us to Yahoo!. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by 2 brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space. By acquiring Yahoo!'s operating business, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo!'s operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications, which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands and sports, finance, news and email into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad-tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news and finance to leverage this scale in the future.
Yahoo!'s operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital-intensive manner. We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo!. In the months ahead, we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future.
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and about[ph] $400 million year-to-date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market.
In June, we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematic's connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale. So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance. I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year.
In Wireless, we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high-quality loyal customer base. Fran's going to cover more of that in a few minutes.
In Wireline, we completed the sale of 3 properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber. We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs. Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree health care will be realized. We've preserved the bargained-for caps on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefits, which, when netted with other post-retirement benefit changes, reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter. I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remained strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning, but our commitment to placing customers first in our business. I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally.
Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always, we are focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program.
So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast-moving, challenging environment and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade.
Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5."
415798,364940734,1012429,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter of 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL",2071,"Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter of 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis.
AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. In Wireless, service revenue, as expected, was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables and an increase in cash taxes. Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter were retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure.
Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion with which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on-balance sheet securitization with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public or 144A on-balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing cost with AAA ratings. Favorable captive finance treatment from 2 credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on-balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated, and debt will also reflect new securitization financing. Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on-balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations and, therefore, lower free cash flow, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter.
Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago as certain benefits that we realized in the prior year period did not recur and timing of tax deductions for early debt retirements varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion. Our disciplined capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality. As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on, and we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter compared with about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rates for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We've recognized that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point, it is too early to forecast any changes.
During the quarter, 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we had about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8% and had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago.
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices. Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices, totaling 173,000, were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn, stemming from the free tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year.
We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and Mass Markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3%; and Mass Markets, which includes small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding the property sold through Frontier. Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong even with the work stoppage and a high prior year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our FiOS Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our Custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter.
In Fios video, net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. FiOS Internet net adds were negative 13,000, and net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing a decline of 90 basis points. FiOS Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total.  Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on constant currency basis, decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remain consistent with prior periods. Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pretax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment. In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to normal operations after the work stoppage.
Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year on Wireless, we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue declines. In Wireline, we completed the sale of the operations in California, Florida and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve, and we are setting the business up for growth. In our new businesses, we enhanced our video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do and the acquisition of Yahoo! to accelerate our video platforms. As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations: full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion; a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million; and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full year 2017.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

First, on Yahoo! synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies, so we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark. But my view on this, John, as we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information, and we'll validate our plans and make our decision. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way. On the -- do we have the assets we need? Certainly, yesterday, when Marni and Tim did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo! has in the areas of sports and finance and email and news, and you match those up with AOL, we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here. But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital, and you say, ""Well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital?"" And my answer always is, I hope not because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment. We should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs. And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa put their heads together, we'll have a long list, and we'll be disciplined as we always are, and there'll be good investments that will drive us to take a larger share of this growing market. So there's been a lot made of, ""oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process?"" I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will be a success for us, and we certainly expect to do better than that."

Thanks, Simon. So on handset cycles, so 2 real points here. One is, obviously, we saw a similar trend, maybe not this dramatic in '14 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that. Unfortunately, for us, though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary, and there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone. So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter, and that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015. As far as the -- how do we stimulate phone -- smartphone growth. Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow, and we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously, tablets being one, and we have a little bit of a headwind there. But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over 1 million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that free tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago, and we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other adds that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall. And if you look at the underlying IARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you are not seeing it in the results because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is a declining math. The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis improvement on service revenue and as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark, and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse. So an 80 basis point this quarter, I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter because of the new pricing in some of the optimization, but we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of '17, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of '17. Finally, on the data center sales, we are coming to an end of the process, and we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that."

Or can you give us a little more color on how you look to maybe manage them differently than they've been managed in the past?

Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas. First, in the sports area. As you know, we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues, certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this, and I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months, you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with. Some of the other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet, but the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights, and we can work on streaming their games not only through the traditional channels of Fios either Custom TV or the full bundle, but over AOL and Yahoo! and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties. The next one is Yahoo! Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly, some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions. And then certainly, news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post, and we can drive a lot of visits to the site. So I think the difference for us is we have a lot of -- us versus the Yahoo! management, we have a lot of the relationships well established because of our Fios and our mobile assets, and we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good line up here. So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know any comments you have on that. But that's where we'll head from a strategic perspective, Mike."

In the notes out this morning, you noted that 93% of the data traffic is of LTE capacity. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE and how much is still available to be tapped to kind of continue to support that 40-plus percent growth rate in consumption?"

Let me go first on the spectrum side, and then Fran can cover the first part of your question about the growth rates. Today, just to say that about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward and expect that we've got plenty of headroom here. The point of my comments in Boston as our good example there is the farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade-off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were -- that the spectrum was demanding. At the Super Bowl last year, we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that the thesis was correct, we were actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion. And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday because now we have a clear field in front of us to not only densify with 4G but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here."

But we believe some of these other things start to really start to generate some top line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate. Now we see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe, once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that, but we're pretty confident on that GDP growth. And then on the bottom line, all I've said -- I've never given a percentage, but all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate and then, of course, the prior year which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said, and we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year."

What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia. We've typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less because of the combined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed, we've been able to put up 6 ultra-high definition TVs, 6 virtual reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So in those services,-- are only drawing in the 300 to 400 megs of throughput. So lots of headroom. Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment where we can cover a 200 home development and see, with normal vegetation with difference in weather patterns, where we think this -- these critical parameters are going to go. Theoretically, looks -- 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable, but again, we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along. From a pure cost perspective, again, I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is, about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today, and the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop. And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same, and remember we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today, so as the -- when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than an ONT and router combination today and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction. But we'll know a lot more as we finish these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of the media to the field to take a look at these deployments so that you can judge for yourself."

And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy along with go90, AOL, Yahoo! coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices, and we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments, if you will, more from a holistic standpoint. So yes, I mean, today, it's 11.4% of the base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going, and that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, mediaco-type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising."

And I mentioned San Francisco because we made a huge deployment with the Super Bowl, and we're going to leverage that in our work with them, but there is no boundary. Now as far as cannibalization, there's an awful lot of dark fiber providers out there, and we've had a lot of discussions with them, and they're very happy to sell, and they've got very good footprints that get deep into some of these networks. As I mentioned, we've obviously just purchased XO 40 metro fiber rings, which gets us into a very strong position, and there's companies out there like XO. So we don't view any issue there. As far as FirstNet under Federal contracting rules, we really can't comment about that while there's an RFP in process. So I'm sorry, I can't make any comment there."

It's interesting, investors have increasingly been asking whether networks really are sufficiently differentiated versus what we've been accustomed to. And of course, some of your competitors are arguing that actually there's not a lot of differentiation anymore and people should be more focused on things like price. So I was hoping we could come back to that. And then just as we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated -- used to be you differentiated on the reliability of voice, more recently it's been the reliability of data and data speeds. Where is the battleground shifting? And how are you going to make sure you continue to be differentiated based on where that's going?"

I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't #1 have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter and all you have to do is look at the churn. And I'd argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter if you have to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally, advertisements are out there aren't completely truthful, but that's the world that we live in. As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other -- I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but can you hear me now has really moved to can you see me now. And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to it just rides the data stream. And so the throughput, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we've seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon and I'd argue throughout the history of wireless is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity. Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here, and we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving the densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade."

He's only got so many tools in his toolbox to help set some of the standards here, but we're encouraging a broader action here that might involve the FTC or others so that every one in the ecosystem is treated the same. And I think that's our philosophy on set-top box. That's our philosophy on privacy. Did it impact us on Yahoo!? No, not particularly. We look at that as a stand-alone business. Certainly, the regulatory environment always enters into your thinking, but we would do Yahoo! regardless of, however, that NPRM turns out, and we think it's going to be a dynamic business for us going forward.

But I'll caveat that comment and say that look, during the strike, we discontinued all advertising, and it takes about 60 days to 90 days to ramp that back up. So albeit the third quarter will be more positive quarter for us, it probably won't be as much as a normal third quarter for us, so a little less than norm, and then we feel that we'll be back in stride by fourth quarter.

I think every content provider, and I think it's fair to say whether you're an advocate for the 300-channel bundle or over the top, you realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo! gives them the ability to reach those specific customers. If you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male millennial and AwesomenessTV has those same sort of numbers for female millennials. So it gives whether you're thinking your part of a large network sports distribution or you're the actual league or you're trying to deliver finance or other news, being able to tap into that is a huge opportunity.

Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo! acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $3.6 billion generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the remeasurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted to $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share. On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employee benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial valuations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year-to-date, unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion.
We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pretax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida and Texas Wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis, the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter compared with $1.04 per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015.
Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pretax basis, representing about $0.07 per share. At the Wireline segment level before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pretax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28, we filed a Form 8-K providing the recast unaudited historical information for the past 9 quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior period results do not include the operations of AOL.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell."

We had an eventful first half of 2016 marked with several strategic milestones. We continued to evolve our wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction, we made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes. In addition, yesterday, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo!'s operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media.
With everything that's going on, I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world. We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy: first, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platforms through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts. For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, even with the explosive growth of data usage. Over the last 16 years, we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone, network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in 10-plus years ago in 1 week. In light of this growing demand, we are continuing to invest in and evolve our wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable and highest-quality wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support wireless network growth.
Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of wireless technology. With 3G, we ushered in the era of wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE, we changed the game for the delivery of wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day.
To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever-increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high-usage areas. We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our wireless network for years to come. Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber-optic network platform capable of supporting wireless and wireline technologies and multiple products. In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston, and we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer are discussions solely about local franchise rights but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective. Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge. Yesterday, the FCC approved our lease arrangement with XO so that we have a clear spectrum path towards 5G deployment, which like 4G will be a game-changer. I think of 5G initially as an effect wireless fiber, which is wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With wireless fiber, the so-called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities. In our labs, we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like with multiple high-definition TVs, laptops, tablets and virtual reality applications served over a wireless connection delivered at speed significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions.
Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low-latency services and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their time lines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset equipment and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low-latency applications. To date, we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners, we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation, and we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem. So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the FCC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade.
Through every generation of technology, our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value and, yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the #1 priority of the company.
With the other 2 tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas starting with video. As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time, with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years, we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV, new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content not only for our Verizon customers but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high-quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in 2 leading digital brands for female and male millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media. We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition, we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar.
That brings us to Yahoo!. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by 2 brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space. By acquiring Yahoo!'s operating business, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo!'s operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications, which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands and sports, finance, news and email into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad-tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news and finance to leverage this scale in the future.
Yahoo!'s operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital-intensive manner. We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo!. In the months ahead, we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future.
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and about [ph] $400 million year-to-date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market.
In June, we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematic's connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale. So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance. I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year.
In Wireless, we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high-quality loyal customer base. Fran's going to cover more of that in a few minutes.
In Wireline, we completed the sale of 3 properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber. We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs. Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree health care will be realized. We've preserved the bargained-for caps on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefits, which, when netted with other post-retirement benefit changes, reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter. I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remained strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning, but our commitment to placing customers first in our business. I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally.
Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always, we are focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program.
So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast-moving, challenging environment and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade.
Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5."
415798,364940734,1012752,"Verizon Communications Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Verizon Communications Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter of 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL",2071,"Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis, total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter of 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis.
AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. In Wireless, service revenue, as expected, was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables and an increase in cash taxes. Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter were retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure.
Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion with which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on-balance sheet securitization with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public or 144A on-balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing cost with AAA ratings. Favorable captive finance treatment from 2 credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on-balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated, and debt will also reflect new securitization financing. Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on-balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations and, therefore, lower free cash flow, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter.
Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago as certain benefits that we realized in the prior year period did not recur and timing of tax deductions for early debt retirements varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion. Our disciplined capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.
We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2x, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality. As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on, and we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter compared with about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rates for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We've recognized that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point, it is too early to forecast any changes.
During the quarter, 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we had about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8% and had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago.
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices. Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices, totaling 173,000, were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn, stemming from the free tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year.
We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and Mass Markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3%; and Mass Markets, which includes small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding the property sold through Frontier. Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong even with the work stoppage and a high prior year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our FiOS Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our Custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter.
In Fios video, net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. FiOS Internet net adds were negative 13,000, and net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing a decline of 90 basis points. FiOS Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve.
Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on constant currency basis, decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remain consistent with prior periods. Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pretax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment. In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to normal operations after the work stoppage.
Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year on Wireless, we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue declines. In Wireline, we completed the sale of the operations in California, Florida and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve, and we are setting the business up for growth. In our new businesses, we enhanced our video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do and the acquisition of Yahoo! to accelerate our video platforms. As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations: full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion; a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million; and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full year 2017.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

First, on Yahoo! synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies, so we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark. But my view on this, John, as we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information, and we'll validate our plans and make our decision. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way. On the -- do we have the assets we need? Certainly, yesterday, when Marni and Tim did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo! has in the areas of sports and finance and email and news, and you match those up with AOL, we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here. But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital, and you say, ""Well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital?"" And my answer always is, I hope not because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment. We should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs. And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa put their heads together, we'll have a long list, and we'll be disciplined as we always are, and there'll be good investments that will drive us to take a larger share of this growing market. So there's been a lot made of, ""oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process?"" I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will be a success for us, and we certainly expect to do better than that."

Thanks, Simon. So on handset cycles, so 2 real points here. One is, obviously, we saw a similar trend, maybe not this dramatic in '14 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that. Unfortunately, for us, though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary, and there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone. So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter, and that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015. As far as the -- how do we stimulate phone -- smartphone growth. Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow, and we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously, tablets being one, and we have a little bit of a headwind there. But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over 1 million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that free tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago, and we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other adds that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall. And if you look at the underlying IARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you are not seeing it in the results because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is a declining math. The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis improvement on service revenue and as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark, and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse. So an 80 basis point this quarter, I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter because of the new pricing in some of the optimization, but we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of '17, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of '17. Finally, on the data center sales, we are coming to an end of the process, and we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that."

Or can you give us a little more color on how you look to maybe manage them differently than they've been managed in the past?

Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas. First, in the sports area. As you know, we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues, certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this, and I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months, you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with. Some of the other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet, but the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights, and we can work on streaming their games not only through the traditional channels of Fios either Custom TV or the full bundle, but over AOL and Yahoo! and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties. The next one is Yahoo! Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly, some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions. And then certainly, news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post, and we can drive a lot of visits to the site. So I think the difference for us is we have a lot of -- us versus the Yahoo! management, we have a lot of the relationships well established because of our Fios and our mobile assets, and we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good line up here. So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know any comments you have on that. But that's where we'll head from a strategic perspective, Mike."

And then second, just I think in Lowell's commentary, you kind of referenced a view that spectrum is not necessarily the be-all, end-all for creating capacity at the margin. In the notes out this morning, you noted that 93% of the data traffic is of LTE capacity. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE and how much is still available to be tapped to kind of continue to support that 40-plus percent growth rate in consumption."

Let me go first on the spectrum side, and then Fran can cover the first part of your question about the growth rates. Today, just to say that about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward and expect that we've got plenty of headroom here. The point of my comments in Boston as our good example there is the farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade-off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were -- that the spectrum was demanding. At the Super Bowl last year, we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that the thesis was correct, we were actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion. And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday because now we have a clear field in front of us to not only densify with 4G but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here."

But we believe some of these other things start to really start to generate some top line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate. Now we see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe, once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that, but we're pretty confident on that GDP growth. And then on the bottom line, all I've said -- I've never given a percentage, but all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate and then, of course, the prior year which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said, and we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year."

What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia. We've typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less because of the combined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed, we've been able to put up 6 ultra-high definition TVs, 6 virtual reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So in those services,-- are only drawing in the 300 to 400 megs of throughput. So lots of headroom. Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment where we can cover a 200 home development and see, with normal vegetation with difference in weather patterns, where we think this -- these critical parameters are going to go. Theoretically, looks -- 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable, but again, we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along. From a pure cost perspective, again, I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is, about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today, and the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop. And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same, and remember we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today, so as the -- when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than an ONT and router combination today and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction. But we'll know a lot more as we finish these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of the media to the field to take a look at these deployments so that you can judge for yourself."

So absolutely, we view tablets as adding value. So traditionally, you would say, well, a tablet that's added to a wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue and that's far less than a smartphone and all that is true. But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we're developing here, more people who have tablets we know watch more video on a tablet. And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy along with go90, AOL, Yahoo! coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices, and we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments, if you will, more from a holistic standpoint. So yes, I mean, today, it's 11.4% of the base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going, and that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, mediaco-type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising."

So I was hoping we could come back to that. And then just as we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated -- used to be you differentiated on the reliability of voice, more recently it's been the reliability of data and data speeds.

I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't #1 have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter and all you have to do is look at the churn. And I'd argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter if you have to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally, advertisements are out there aren't completely truthful, but that's the world that we live in. As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other -- I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but can you hear me now has really moved to can you see me now. And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to it just rides the data stream. And so the throughput, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we've seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon and I'd argue throughout the history of wireless is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity. Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here, and we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving the densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade."

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo; and Matt Ellis, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Finance Operations and Chief Financial Officer Designate. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension remeasurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 million charge and severance costs relating to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share. 
In third quarter 2015, earnings include $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension remeasurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter, a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter, we executed on our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion. The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric. But overall, net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on-balance sheet financings in future periods. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation, we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders. Competitive activity in the wireless market increased the during the third quarter as expected, and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and disciplined promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high-value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. 
In the wireline market, we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter. We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share. 
We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consist of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy, starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. 
We continued to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IoT solutions. 
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders. 
Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the 3 Wireline markets to Frontier, which closed on April 1, 2016, and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of Wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%. 
In terms of Wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes, ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion, up 1%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business, which we expect will enable us to deliver our strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind, as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement; while in prior periods, under the off-balance sheet securitization model, this funding would have flowed from cash flow from operations. Free cash flow for the 9 months of the year totaled $6.2 billion, which was impacted by our on-balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago, primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our Wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods, which did not occur in this period. Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter, driven by increased spending in Wireless for densification and in Wireline for Fios installations as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt, which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into the reviews of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017. 
Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion, down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70% given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes. During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. 
Total Wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion. The cost structure in Wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain, resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year, and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9%, up 170 basis points from 43.2%. 
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions, we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones, resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones. Overall, net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million, down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04%, up 11 basis points, driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed,
[Audio Gap]
retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remained below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.5 million. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were $10.7 million [ph] in the quarter, up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations. About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog primarily for upgrades. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2%; and mass markets, which include small business, declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4%, with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for custom TV. During the third quarter, we returned to normal seasonal volumes, ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which were at prework stoppage levels. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1%, representing an increase of 30 basis points. In Fios Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which was also consistent with prework stoppage levels. Fios Video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4%, representing a decline of 90 basis points, driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter, consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4%. And on a constant currency basis, the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year, up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter. 
Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets, delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population. We are steadily advancing our cloud and software-defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our One Fiber strategy initiative is on track, and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston. In July, the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications, clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful, and we are now planning our commercial pilot program in 2017 where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalize fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States. 
In the third quarter, network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content. In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic, we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ad-tech capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. 
In the third quarter, AOL's net revenue measured as gross revenue, less traffic acquisition cost, amounted to $486 million, which represented an increase of approximately 10%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to onetime benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal especially in the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high-quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo! will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video, and to monetize the content. 
On the go90 platform, the level of your engagement, as measured by daily usage, has been rising steadily since replatforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon Wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content. For example, in July, we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled The Runner. Viewers can watch episodes aired 3x daily via the go90 app, go90.com and aol.com. The innovative game format with an emphasis on live user participation contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter, we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsored data service, which allows customers to stream live sports, including NFL games and music without it counting against their Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application. 
In September, with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks, which brings together complex and digital video networks, RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV. In the United States, Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population, and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90, which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth. 
The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale telematics, ThinkSpace, Smart City and other IoT solutions globally. Organically, IoT revenues were $217 million, up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including 2 months of Telogis activity, IoT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IoT revenues were primarily driven by telematics. Telogis, which closed in July, expands our telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space. 
In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global Software-as-a-Service-based telematics provider in the small- and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September, we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IoT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IoT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in Wireless, we added over 442,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our Wireless service revenue trends. In Wireline, Fios' performance was ahead of our expectations. In both Wireless and Wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platform to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses, we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range. We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million, which consist of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically, consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year, and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base",669,"Yes, thanks, Phil. I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base, and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base both in phones. But as I've said before, smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But it's just a couple of things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth. And really, it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw, we gave you for the first time our phone churn, which is at the 0.90% for the last 6 consecutive quarters. So you can see we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course, this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked, when the competitive world launched these new price plans and this quarter was around unlimited. And obviously, we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a 2- to 3-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that 3 weeks, everything kind of normalizes back out. So once we got through that, we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7. And then unfortunately, there was a total recall of that phone, which definitely impacted our growth because historically, Verizon has always been the #1 leader in high-end Samsung phones. So that certainly impacted us. And then, of course, we have the Apple launch. And as normal, everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things. The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones. And you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000, and that's really where we're focusing on. As you saw also, we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category. And we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment. So we did launch some new prepaid pricing. And what we did see was we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid more than we've seen in history. And that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter, so we did see some shift in our base. But the good news there is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer at least on the Verizon Wireless network. So going forward, as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation. But as we continue here, unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to. But as you saw also, we launched new pricing this quarter, which we believe also addressed 2 of the major pain points for our customers. One was overage, and we saw over 7 million of our customers move to the new safe mode plans that we constructed, which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allowed them to now carry over if they buy an extra gig for the month. If that gig is not totally used, we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base. But obviously, there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment. And we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business."

That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017, we now have 60% of the base on the nonsubsidized pricing. That will continue to expand, and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year. And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the Wireline business. But remember, we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continued to make good progress in IoT and the video advertising space. And we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP-type top line growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call."

I can't speak to the economics of what they're going to do. You have to ask them that question. But look, as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow. Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry with the carriers will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless, that's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry. So look, again, we'll compete against the competition. We'll compete against the new entrants in the marketplace. We'll wait to see what's launched.

As far as the margin profile goes, look, I mean, these companies are still maturing. They're profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage onto these platforms. The other thing, too, to note that in the IoT world, since it is a platform-based technology whether you look at IoT or Smart Citys, these are all very, what I would call, minimally capital-intensive-type businesses, and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than, say, on a network-based-type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly, but the margin will come and we'll talk more about that as we grow this business. Matt, on Wireline?"

Another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes. So we're going to test this in very different types of commercial environments. The big issue that still has to be answered, quite honestly, is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell, how much can each a small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 gigabit of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home. So that still has to be answered, and we expect to gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch.

We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business whether that's reducing a number of calls we received, reducing the transaction times, moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, et cetera, and you should see more of that continue. Wireline, we have the full-year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we talked about. That will continue to help us expand the margin there. And then the other parts of the business whether be it IoT or the videos we continue to add scale there, the margins there should improve.

So on Yahoo!, look, Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently, so let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still evaluating what it means for this transaction.

So unless Yahoo! comes up with different process, it's going to take some time to evaluate this. So until then, we haven't reached any final conclusions around this issue. As far as the privacy goes, look, I think there's a couple of things here. I mean, obviously, we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We lived under the regulation of the FCC, which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy. And what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem. So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC, and then we'll have to reacted to that. But look, I mean, we're operating AOL today under the current environment, and we will continue to operate. And as you saw, we continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation. So I think we'll just have to wait and see where this all comes out, but we're hoping that it will be an equal playing field across-the-board."

And as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come. And obviously, we know that video is the major driver of the usage with a 45% increase year-over-year. I think the stat now is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase, so we're really preparing for 2 years out from where our usage is today, so we are densifying the network. And we've seen this movie before where CapEx trends go down and user catches up and then all of a sudden the networks falters. So look, I think the group metrics report speak for themselves. Once again, we won hands-down across the country. That is the brand that we live by, and we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customers' advance before they actually realize they need it."

We know that the telematics business is a business that has high potential. And if you looked across the industry, there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace, and we want to gain more share within that marketplace and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between and Fleetmatics here. So we'll continue to move in that direction, but I don't think that there's anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets, and that's what our telematics group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched hum. Hum came out of the telematics group. Although for the majority sold to Verizon Wireless, it actually is a product that comes up with the telematics group. So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around Smart City's because we believe that with the pre-positioning of the 5G and the latency issue, Smart City is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean, we have demonstrated would certain cities where at the point in now that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future. And then around MediaCo, obviously, we have the Yahoo! asset sitting out there. But to date, we have accumulated assets that we believe are many strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer or communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years, so we have to think about it different way to monetize our network capability, and that monetization will come through advertising. And it's real simple. I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore, you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL. Even with a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model, and we believe we have the right assets to do that. So along short answer, there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time."

Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension remeasurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 million charge and severance costs relating to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share. 
In third quarter 2015, earnings include $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension remeasurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter, a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter, we executed on our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion. The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric. But overall, net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on-balance sheet financings in future periods. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation, we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders. Competitive activity in the wireless market increased the during the third quarter as expected, and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and disciplined promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high-value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. 
In the wireline market, we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter. We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share. 
We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consist of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy, starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. 
We continued to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IoT solutions. 
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders. 
Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the 3 Wireline markets to Frontier, which closed on April 1, 2016, and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of Wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%. 
In terms of Wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes, ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion, up 1%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business, which we expect will enable us to deliver our strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind, as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement; while in prior periods, under the off-balance sheet securitization model, this funding would have flowed from cash flow from operations. Free cash flow for the 9 months of the year totaled $6.2 billion, which was impacted by our on-balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago, primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our Wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods, which did not occur in this period. Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter, driven by increased spending in Wireless for densification and in Wireline for Fios installations as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt, which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into the reviews of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017. 
Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion, down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70% given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes. During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. 
Total Wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion. The cost structure in Wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain, resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year, and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9%, up 170 basis points from 43.2%. 
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions, we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones, resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones. Overall, net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million, down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04%, up 11 basis points, driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next year as 2-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off. We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remained below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.5 million. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter, up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations. About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog primarily for upgrades. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2%; and mass markets, which include small business, declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4%, with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for custom TV. During the third quarter, we returned to normal seasonal volumes, ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which were at prework stoppage levels. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1%, representing an increase of 30 basis points. In Fios Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which was also consistent with prework stoppage levels. Fios Video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4%, representing a decline of 90 basis points, driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter, consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4%. And on a constant currency basis, the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year, up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter. 
Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets, delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population. We are steadily advancing our cloud and software-defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our One Fiber strategy initiative is on track, and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston. In July, the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications, clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful, and we are now planning our commercial pilot program in 2017 where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalize fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States. 
In the third quarter, network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content. In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic, we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ad-tech capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. 
In the third quarter, AOL's net revenue measured as gross revenue, less traffic acquisition cost, amounted to $486 million, which represented an increase of approximately 10%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to onetime benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal especially in the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high-quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo! will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video, and to monetize the content. 
On the go90 platform, the level of your engagement, as measured by daily usage, has been rising steadily since replatforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon Wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content. For example, in July, we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled The Runner. Viewers can watch episodes aired 3x daily via the go90 app, go90.com and aol.com. The innovative game format with an emphasis on live user participation contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter, we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsored data service, which allows customers to stream live sports, including NFL games and music without it counting against their Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application. 
In September, with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks, which brings together complex and digital video networks, RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV. In the United States, Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population, and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90, which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth. 
The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale telematics, ThinkSpace, Smart City and other IoT solutions globally. Organically, IoT revenues were $217 million, up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including 2 months of Telogis activity, IoT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IoT revenues were primarily driven by telematics. Telogis, which closed in July, expands our telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space. 
In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global Software-as-a-Service-based telematics provider in the small- and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September, we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IoT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IoT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in Wireless, we added over 442,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our Wireless service revenue trends. In Wireline, Fios' performance was ahead of our expectations. In both Wireless and Wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platform to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses, we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range. We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million, which consist of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically, consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year, and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base, and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base",669,"Yes, thanks, Phil. I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base, and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base both in phones. But as I've said before, smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But it's just a couple of things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth. And really, it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw, we gave you for the first time our phone churn, which is at the 0.90% for the last 6 consecutive quarters. So you can see we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course, this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked, when the competitive world launched these new price plans and this quarter was around unlimited. And obviously, we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a 2- to 3-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that 3 weeks, everything kind of normalizes back out. So once we got through that, we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7. And then unfortunately, there was a total recall of that phone, which definitely impacted our growth because historically, Verizon has always been the #1 leader in high-end Samsung phones. So that certainly impacted us. And then, of course, we have the Apple launch. And as normal, everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things. The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones. And you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000, and that's really where we're focusing on. As you saw also, we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category. And we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment. So we did launch some new prepaid pricing. And what we did see was we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid more than we've seen in history. And that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter, so we did see some shift in our base. But the good news there is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer at least on the Verizon Wireless network. So going forward, as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation. But as we continue here, unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to. But as you saw also, we launched new pricing this quarter, which we believe also addressed 2 of the major pain points for our customers. One was overage, and we saw over 7 million of our customers move to the new safe mode plans that we constructed, which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allowed them to now carry over if they buy an extra gig for the month. If that gig is not totally used, we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base. But obviously, there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment. And we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business."

As we've said, we've been doing this transition. You've seen the year-over-year service revenue trajectory continue to improve. We're at negative 6.2% in the first quarter. That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017, we now have 60% of the base on the nonsubsidized pricing. That will continue to expand, and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year. And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the Wireline business. But remember, we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continued to make good progress in IoT and the video advertising space. And we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP-type top line growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call."

Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry with the carriers will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless, that's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry.

As far as the margin profile goes, look, I mean, these companies are still maturing. They're profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage and -- onto these platforms. The other thing, too, to note that in the IoT world, since it is a platform-based technology, whether you look at IoT or Smart City's, these are all very, what I would call, minimally capital-intensive-type businesses, and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than, say, on a network-based-type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly.

The big issue that still has to be answered, quite honestly, is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell, how much can each small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 gigabit of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home? So that still has to be answered. And we expect to gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch.

We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business, whether that's reducing a number of calls we received, reducing the transaction times, moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, et cetera, and you should see more of that continue.

As far as the privacy goes, look, I think there's a couple of things here. I mean, obviously, we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We live under the regulation of the FCC, which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy. And what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent, and so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem. So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC. And then we'll have to react to that. But look, I mean, we -- we're operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate. And as you saw, we continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation.

That's obviously contributing. We saw a very strong adoption from our existing base to the new price plans. We saw a number of those customers step up in terms of the buckets they are purchasing. And so I think you see that we have a very strong relationship with our base. And our consumers continue to take full advantage of the network. We've seen video use -- or total usage on the Wireless network up about 45% this year, and you continue to see that sharpen the ARPU trend. So yes, as you think about heading into 2017, we expect to see -- especially as we've got 60% of the base now on the nonsubsidized pricing, we expect to continue to see some strong ARPA trends as we go forward into next year."

But we're still spending 17 -- around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx. The other thing, too, is you have to remember, we're spending our CapEx around Wireless for LTE densification. And as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come. And obviously, we know that video is the major driver of the usage with a 45% increase year-over-year. I think the stat now is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase, so we're really preparing for 2 years out from where our usage is today, so we are densifying the network. And we've seen this movie before where CapEx trends goes down and user catches up and then all of a sudden, the networks falter. so look, I think the group metrics report speak for themselves. Once again, we won hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by. And we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customers' demands before they actually realize they need it."

We know that the telematics business is a business that has high potential. And if you look across the industry, there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace and we want to gain more share within that marketplace. and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between Telogis and Fleetmatics here. So we'll continue to move in that direction. But I don't think that there's anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets, and that's what our telematics group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched hum. Hum came out of the telematics group. Although it is, for the majority, sold through Verizon Wireless, it actually is a product that come out of the telematics group. So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around Smart City's because we believe that with the pre-positioning on the 5G and the latency issue, Smart City's is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean, we have demonstrated with certain cities we're at the point in now that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future. And then around Media Co., obviously, we have the Yahoo! asset sitting out there. But to date, we have accumulated assets that we believe are really strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years. So we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability, and that monetization will come through advertising. And it's real simple. I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore, you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL. Even with the 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model. And we believe we have the right assets to do that. So the long and short of the answer is there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time."

Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension remeasurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 million charge and severance costs related to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share. 
In third quarter 2015, earnings included $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension remeasurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter, a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter, we executed on our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion. The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric. But overall, net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on-balance sheet financings in future periods. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us, just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation, we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders. Competitive activity in the wireless market increased during the third quarter as expected, and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and disciplined promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high-value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. 
In the wireline market, we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter. We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share. 
We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consists of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy, starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. 
We continued to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IoT solutions. 
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders. 
Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the 3 Wireline markets to Frontier, which closed on April 1, 2016, and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of Wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%. 
In terms of Wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes, ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion, up 1%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business, which we expect will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind, as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement; while in prior periods, under the off-balance sheet securitization model, this funding would have flowed through cash flow from operations. Free cash flow for the 9 months of the year totaled $6.2 billion, which was impacted by our on-balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago, primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our Wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods, which did not occur in this period. Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter, driven by increased spending in Wireless for densification and in Wireline for Fios installations, as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt, which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into the reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017. 
Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion, down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70%, given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes. During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. 
Total Wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion. The cost structure in Wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain, resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year, and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9%, up 170 basis points from 43.2%. 
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions, we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones, resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones. Overall, net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million, down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04%, up 11 basis points, driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next year as 2-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off. We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remained below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.5 million. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter, up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations. About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog, primarily for upgrades. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2%, and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4%, with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for Custom TV. During the third quarter, we returned to normal seasonal volumes, ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which were at pre-work stoppage levels. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1%, representing an increase of 30 basis points. In Fios Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which was also consistent with pre-work stoppage levels. Fios Video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4%, representing a decline of 90 basis points, driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter, consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4%. And on a constant currency basis, the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year, up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter. 
Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets, delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population. We are steadily advancing our cloud and software-defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our One Fiber strategy initiative is on track, and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston. In July, the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications, clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful, and we are now planning our commercial pilot program in 2017, where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalize fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States. 
In the third quarter, network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content. In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic, we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ad-tech capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well-positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. 
In the third quarter, AOL's net revenue, measured as gross revenue less traffic acquisition cost, amounted to $486 million, which represented an increase of approximately 10%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to onetime benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal, especially in the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high-quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo! will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video and to monetize the content. 
On the go90 platform, the level of viewer engagement, as measured by daily usage, has been rising steadily since replatforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon Wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content. For example, in July, we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled The Runner. Viewers can watch episodes aired 3 times daily via the go90 app, go90.com and aol.com. The innovative game format, with an emphasis on live user participation, contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter, we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsored data service, which allows customers to stream live sports, including NFL games and music without it counting against their Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application. 
In September, with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks, which brings together complex and digital video networks RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV. In the United States, Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population, and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90, which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth. 
The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale telematics, ThinkSpace, Smart City and other IoT solutions globally. Organically, IoT revenues were $217 million, up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including 2 months of Telogis activity, IoT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IoT revenues were primarily driven by telematics. Telogis, which closed in July, expands our telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space. 
In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global Software-as-a-Service-based telematics provider in the small- and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September, we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IoT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IoT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in Wireless, we added over 442,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our Wireless service revenue trends. In Wireline, Fios performance was ahead of our expectations. In both Wireless and Wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platforms to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses, we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations: Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range. We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million, which consist of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically, consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year, and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base, and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base,",670,"Yes, thanks, Phil. I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base, and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base, both in phones. But as I've said before, smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But it's just a couple of things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth. And really, it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw, we gave you for the first time our phone churn, which is at a 0.90% for the last 6 consecutive quarters. So you can see that we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course, this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked, when the competitive world launches new price plans, and this quarter was around unlimited, and obviously, we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a 2- to 3-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that 3 weeks, everything kind of normalizes back out. So once we got through that, we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7. And then unfortunately, there was a total recall of that phone, which definitely impacted our growth, because historically, Verizon has always been the #1 leader in high-end Samsung phones. So that certainly impacted us. And then, of course, we have the Apple launch. And as normal, everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things. The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones. And you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000, and that's really where we're focused in on. As you saw also, we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category. And we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment. So we did launch some new prepaid pricing. And what we did see was we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid, more than we've seen in history. And that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter, so we did see some shift in our base. But the good news there is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer, at least on the Verizon Wireless network. So going forward, as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation. But as we continue here, unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to. But as you saw also, we launched new pricing this quarter, which we believe also addressed 2 of the major pain points for our customers. One was overage, and we saw over 7 million of our customers move to the new safe mode plans that we constructed, which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allowed them to now carry over, if they buy an extra gig for a month, if that gig is not totally used, we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base. But obviously, there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment. And we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business."

As we've said, we've been doing this transition. You've seen the year-over-year service revenue trajectory continue to improve. We were at negative 6.2% in the first quarter. That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017, we now have 60% of the base on the nonsubsidized pricing. That will continue to expand, and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year. And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the Wireline business. But remember, we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continue to make good progress in IoT and the video advertising space. And we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP-type top line growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call."

I can't speak to the economics of what they're going to do. You'll have to ask them that question. But look, as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow. Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry, with the carriers, will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless, that's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry. So look, again, we'll compete against the competition. We'll compete against new entrants in the marketplace. We'll wait to see what's launched. And as I said before, we'll respond where we need to respond, and we'll wait to see what happens."

As far as the margin profile goes, look, I mean, these companies are still maturing. They're profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage and -- onto these platforms. The other thing, too, to note that in the IoT world, since it is a platform-based technology, whether you look at IoT or Smart Cities, these are all very, what I would call, minimally capital-intensive-type businesses, and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than, say, on a network-based-type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly.

So for the 5G, obviously, we've been mainly centered around the lab testing of 5G. We are now moving out into the commercial trial, which we're going to span out across several different cities with several different types of testing with different OEMs. So one -- to give you an example, one city may be a very dense city, going into multidivisional areas. Another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes. So we're going to test this in very different types of commercial environments. The big issue that still has to be answered, quite honestly, is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell, how much can each small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 gigabit of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home? So that still has to be answered. And we expect to gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch. So at this point, that's really all there is to talk about from a 5G perspective. Matt, I'll turn it over to you."

And then you layer in on top of that the continued cost improvements we talked about in Wireless, obviously, it started last year with the restructuring of the business. We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business, whether that's reducing the number of calls we receive, reducing the transaction times, moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, et cetera, and you should see more of that continue. Wireline, we have the full-year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we've talked about. That will continue to help us expand the margin there. And then in the other parts of the business, whether it be the IoT or the videos, we continue to add scale there, the margins there should improve. So when you add those things up, you're going to get to an improvement in EPS that we think is in line with what the expectation out on the Street should be."

So on Yahoo!, look, Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently, so let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still evaluating what it means for this transaction.

The lawyers had their first call yesterday with Yahoo! to provide us information, but from what I understand, that's going to be a long process. So unless Yahoo! comes up with a different process, it's going to take some time to evaluate this. So until then, we haven't reached any final conclusions around this issue. As far as the privacy goes, look, I think there's a couple of things here. I mean, obviously, we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We live under the regulation of the FCC, which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy. And what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent, and so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem. So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC. And then we'll have to react to that. But look, I mean, we -- we're operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate. And as you saw, we continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation. So I think we'll just have to wait to see where this all comes out. But we're hoping that it's an equal playing field across the board."

But we're still spending 17 -- around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx. The other thing, too, is you have to remember, we're spending our CapEx around Wireless for LTE densification. And as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come. And obviously, we know that video is the major driver of the usage with a 45% increase year-over-year. I think the stat now is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase, so we're really preparing for 2 years out from where our usage is today, so we are densifying the network. And we've seen this movie before, where CapEx trends goes down and user catches up and then all of a sudden, the networks falter. So look, I think the RootMetrics report speak for themselves. Once again, we won hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by.

We know that the telematics business is a business that has high potential. And if you looked across the industry, there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace and we want to gain more share within that marketplace, and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between Telogis and Fleetmatics here. So we'll continue to move in that direction. But I don't think that there's anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets, and that's what our telematics group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched hum. Hum came out of the telematics group. Although it is, for the majority sold through Verizon Wireless, it actually is a product to come out of the telematics group. So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around Smart Cities, because we believe that with the pre-positioning on the 5G and the latency issues, Smart Cities is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean, we have demonstrated with certain cities where we're deploying it now, that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future. And then around Media Co., obviously, we have the Yahoo! asset sitting out there. But to date, we have accumulated assets that we believe are really strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years. So we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability, and that monetization will come through advertising. And it's real simple. I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore, you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL. Even with the 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model. And we believe we have the right assets to do that.

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo; and Matt Ellis, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Finance Operations and Chief Financial Officer Designate. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. 
Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. 
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. 
Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pretax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension remeasurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 million charge and severance costs related to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share. 
In third quarter 2015, earnings included $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension remeasurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter, a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter, we executed on our first on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion. The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric. But overall, net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on-balance sheet financings in future periods. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us, just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation, we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders. Competitive activity in the wireless market increased during the third quarter as expected, and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and disciplined promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high-value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. 
In the wireline market, we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter. We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share. 
We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consists of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy, starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. 
We continued to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IoT solutions. 
In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders. 
Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the 3 Wireline markets to Frontier, which closed on April 1, 2016, and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of Wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%. 
In terms of Wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes, ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion, up 1%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business, which we expect will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind, as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement; while in prior periods, under the off-balance sheet securitization model, this funding would have flowed through cash flow from operations. Free cash flow for the 9 months of the year totaled $6.2 billion, which was impacted by our on-balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago, primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our Wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods, which did not occur in this period. Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter, driven by increased spending in Wireless for densification and in Wireline for Fios installations, as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt, which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3x. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 time frame. 
Now let's move into the reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017. 
Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion, down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70%, given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes. During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total, we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. 
Total Wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion. The cost structure in Wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain, resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year, and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9%, up 170 basis points from 43.2%. 
Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions, we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones, resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones. Overall, net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million, down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04%, up 11 basis points, driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next year as 2-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off. We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remained below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.5 million. 
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter, up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations. About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog, primarily for upgrades. 
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2%, and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4%, with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for Custom TV. During the third quarter, we returned to normal seasonal volumes, ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband, we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter, which were at pre-work stoppage levels. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1%, representing an increase of 30 basis points. In Fios Video, we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which was also consistent with pre-work stoppage levels. Fios Video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4%, representing a decline of 90 basis points, driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter, consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4%. And on a constant currency basis, the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year, up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter. 
Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets, delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population. We are steadily advancing our cloud and software-defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our One Fiber strategy initiative is on track, and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston. In July, the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications, clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful, and we are now planning our commercial pilot program in 2017, where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalize fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States. 
In the third quarter, network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content. In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic, we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ad-tech capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well-positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. 
In the third quarter, AOL's net revenue, measured as gross revenue less traffic acquisition cost, amounted to $486 million, which represented an increase of approximately 10%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to onetime benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal, especially in the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high-quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo! will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video and to monetize the content. 
On the go90 platform, the level of viewer engagement, as measured by daily usage, has been rising steadily since replatforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon Wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content. For example, in July, we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled The Runner. Viewers can watch episodes aired 3 times daily via the go90 app, go90.com and aol.com. The innovative game format, with an emphasis on live user participation, contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter, we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsored data service, which allows customers to stream live sports, including NFL games and music without it counting against their Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application. 
In September, with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks, which brings together complex and digital video networks RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV. In the United States, Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population, and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90, which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth. 
The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale telematics, ThinkSpace, Smart City and other IoT solutions globally. Organically, IoT revenues were $217 million, up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including 2 months of Telogis activity, IoT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IoT revenues were primarily driven by telematics. Telogis, which closed in July, expands our telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space. 
In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global Software-as-a-Service-based telematics provider in the small- and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September, we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IoT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IoT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in Wireless, we added over 442,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our Wireless service revenue trends. In Wireline, Fios performance was ahead of our expectations. In both Wireless and Wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platforms to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses, we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations: Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage; consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015; consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range. We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million, which consist of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically, consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year, and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions."

Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base,",670,"Yes, thanks, Phil. I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high-quality base, and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base, both in phones. But as I've said before, smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But it's just a couple of things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth. And really, it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw, we gave you for the first time our phone churn, which is at a 0.90% for the last 6 consecutive quarters. So you can see that we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course, this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked, when the competitive world launches new price plans, and this quarter was around unlimited, and obviously, we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a 2- to 3-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that 3 weeks, everything kind of normalizes back out. So once we got through that, we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7. And then unfortunately, there was a total recall of that phone, which definitely impacted our growth, because historically, Verizon has always been the #1 leader in high-end Samsung phones. So that certainly impacted us. And then, of course, we have the Apple launch. And as normal, everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things. The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones. And you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000, and that's really where we're focused in on. As you saw also, we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category. And we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment. So we did launch some new prepaid pricing. And what we did see was we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid, more than we've seen in history. And that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter, so we did see some shift in our base. But the good news there is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer, at least on the Verizon Wireless network. So going forward, as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation. But as we continue here, unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to. But as you saw also, we launched new pricing this quarter, which we believe also addressed 2 of the major pain points for our customers. One was overage, and we saw over 7 million of our customers move to the new safe mode plans that we constructed, which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allowed them to now carry over, if they buy an extra gig for a month, if that gig is not totally used, we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base. But obviously, there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment. And we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business."

That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017, we now have 60% of the base on the nonsubsidized pricing. That will continue to expand, and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year. And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the Wireline business. But remember, we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continue to make good progress in IoT and the video advertising space. And we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP-type top line growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call."

I can't speak to the economics of what they're going to do. You'll have to ask them that question. But look, as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow. Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry, with the carriers, will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless, that's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry. So look, again, we'll compete against the competition. We'll compete against new entrants in the marketplace. We'll wait to see what's launched. And as I said before, we'll respond where we need to respond, and we'll wait to see what happens."

As far as the margin profile goes, look, I mean, these companies are still maturing. They're profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage and -- onto these platforms. The other thing, too, to note that in the IoT world, since it is a platform-based technology, whether you look at IoT or Smart Cities, these are all very, what I would call, minimally capital-intensive-type businesses, and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than, say, on a network-based-type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly. But the margin will come and we'll talk more about that as we grow this business. Matt, on Wireline?"

Another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes. So we're going to test this in very different types of commercial environments. The big issue that still has to be answered, quite honestly, is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell, how much can each small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 gigabit of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home? So that still has to be answered. And we expect to gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch.

We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business, whether that's reducing the number of calls we receive, reducing the transaction times, moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, et cetera, and you should see more of that continue. Wireline, we have the full-year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we've talked about. That will continue to help us expand the margin there. And then in the other parts of the business, whether it be the IoT or the videos, we continue to add scale there, the margins there should improve.

So on Yahoo!, look, Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently, so let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still evaluating what it means for this transaction.

The lawyers had their first call yesterday with Yahoo! to provide us information, but from what I understand, that's going to be a long process. So unless Yahoo! comes up with a different process, it's going to take some time to evaluate this. So until then, we haven't reached any final conclusions around this issue. As far as the privacy goes, look, I think there's a couple of things here. I mean, obviously, we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We live under the regulation of the FCC, which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy. And what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent, and so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem. So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC. And then we'll have to react to that. But look, I mean, we -- we're operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate. And as you saw, we continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation. So I think we'll just have to wait to see where this all comes out. But we're hoping that it's an equal playing field across the board."

So look, on the CapEx trend, I mean, I think this was all related to the strike that we experienced in the second quarter. And we're not going to be able to catch up on that from an overall or year-over-year perspective. So that's why we've revised the guidance to the lower end of our range. But we're still spending 17 -- around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx. The other thing, too, is you have to remember, we're spending our CapEx around Wireless for LTE densification. And as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come. And obviously, we know that video is the major driver of the usage with a 45% increase year-over-year. I think the stat now is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase, so we're really preparing for 2 years out from where our usage is today, so we are densifying the network. And we've seen this movie before, where CapEx trends goes down and user catches up and then all of a sudden, the networks falter. So look, I think the RootMetrics report speak for themselves. Once again, we won hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by. And we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customers' demands before they actually realize they need it."

Clearly, you folks have made a concerted effort towards improving your asset portfolio to support both the Media Co. and IoT initiatives. As it stands today, do you see any areas where you may need to bolster your pool of assets in order to move forward with these strategies? Or as you exit this transition year, should we consider 2017 more of an integration year for you folks?"

We know that the telematics business is a business that has high potential. And if you looked across the industry, there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace and we want to gain more share within that marketplace, and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between Telogis and Fleetmatics here. So we'll continue to move in that direction. But I don't think that there's anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets, and that's what our telematics group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched hum. Hum came out of the telematics group. Although it is, for the majority sold through Verizon Wireless, it actually is a product to come out of the telematics group. So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around Smart Cities, because we believe that with the pre-positioning on the 5G and the latency issues, Smart Cities is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean, we have demonstrated with certain cities where we're deploying it now, that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future. And then around Media Co., obviously, we have the Yahoo! asset sitting out there. But to date, we have accumulated assets that we believe are really strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years. So we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability, and that monetization will come through advertising. And it's real simple. I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore, you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL. Even with the 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model. And we believe we have the right assets to do that. So the long and short of the answer is there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time."

It does seem like increasingly, many are attempting to gain share from consumers via video, not just some of your peers in the market, but on a whole technology company level as well. How do you view your positioning and your ability to differentiate going forward?

So if you go to AOL now, you're going to start to see Complex come through. You will see RatedRed and Seriously.TV in the future come through on that platform. If you look at the NFL, we've adopted that into the go90 platform. And I know there's been some articles around viewership of NFL. We've actually seen a healthy increase year-over-year on our platform around the NFL. So we are headed in the right direction. The key learnings here have been you need to have the right content that is appealing to the audience that you're going after. And you've seen us make moves. You're going to see us move out of certain content that was originally in go90 that just isn't the right content. But sports, news, live, original content, is where the direction that we're taking on this platform. And we think we'll be successful with that."
