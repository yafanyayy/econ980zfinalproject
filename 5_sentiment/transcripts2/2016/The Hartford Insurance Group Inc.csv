Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2015 was a successful year for The Hartford. Core earnings per diluted share increased 15% over 2014, core earnings ROE rose to 9.2% from 8.4%, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew by 7%, we reduced debt by $750 million, and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders.
Doug and Beth will go into further details of our 2015 performance, but I would like to touch on a few highlights. First, Property & Casualty had a very strong year. The underlying command ratio improved 0.5 point to 91, and topline growth continued, reflecting an increase in new business and the benefit of pricing and underwriting actions we've made over the past few years.
Group Benefits had a very strong year. The business generated a 5.6% core earnings margin exceeding our plan and pivoted to growth with a 2% increase in fully insured ongoing premiums.
We continue to execute on our strategy at Talcott Resolution. The business is running off steadily, returning capital to the holding company and our hedge programs and working effectively. Our Mutual Funds business generated $1.5 billion of positive net flows and 2015, increased sales by 15% and delivered solid relative fund performance.  And our ratings where upgraded by Best, Moody's and S&P, an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance and financial flexibility. We delivered these strong financial results and increased our top line momentum, while investing in the capabilities and talent that are making is a broader and deeper risk player, in a more efficient customer-focused company, that can deliver sustainable, profitable growth. For example, the strong talent we attracted to the organization, particularly in underwriting, sales, data and technology, enabling us to judiciously expand into new market industry verticals. Doug will touch upon this in a moment. 
The investments we made in new system such as our claim system, our Group Benefits enrollment system, and our Middle Market underwriting desktop, are both reducing cycle times, and importantly, enhancing the experiences we are delivering to agents and customers.
Our understanding of the business implications of accelerating technological change, shifting demographics and evolving customer expectation, is informing the investments we're making in product, distribution and service. And recent marketing investments have increased the visibility of our iconic brand. For example, our sponsorship of Major League Baseball fully rolls out into 2016, and we recently announced the extension of our 20-plus-year relationship with the U.S. Paralympics to 2020.
As all of you know, the market is becoming increasingly competitive and the investment environment is less favorable. Consolidation amongst carriers as well as agents and brokers has accelerated. Legacy IT platforms our aging and are costly to maintain. We faced disruption from the advent of Big Data, vehicles and new capital entering the market. Interest rates are low, and are expected to be lower for longer. These dynamics are challenging insurance companies to reevaluate their operations and to adapt. We believe that Hartford is well-positioned to address these challenges and to take advantage of the market opportunities they present.
We enter 2016 with a strong portfolio of businesses and capital flexibility. We remain focused on organically growing each of our businesses, and we will explore acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. We will maintain underwriting discipline and tightly manage expenses to support ongoing investments in the capabilities and talent needed to be top of line company for the products we offer through our distribution partners. And we will continue to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, with business performance and effective capital management that returns excess capital to shareholders.
Our 2016 outlook for core earnings is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion., excluding Talcott, this range represents core earnings growth of approximately 5%, adjusted for favorable CATs and other items in 2015. We also intend to complete our capital management plan, including the $1.3 billion of share repurchases.
In closing, let me express how proud I am of what we were accomplished in 2015, and my sincere thanks to our leadership team, our employees, agents and customers, and our investors for their continued support and confidence. We have a clear strategy and experience and that stable management team, a powerful national distribution network, differentiated products and a brand that stands for strength and integrity.
As we enter 2016, I'm confident in our ability to navigate this dynamic and competitive environment, and continue to create shareholder value. Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug."

I will provide an overview of our 2015 results and Property & Casualty and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts look forward to 2016.
2015 was another year of strong financial performance, with improved results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits. In Personal Lines, results were below our expectations, but we remain pleased with the trends of our AARP Direct business and the progress we've made to reposition agency.
Let me get right into our financial results. In Commercial Lines, we delivered over $1 billion of core earnings for the full year on an all-in command ratio of 92.6, 8/10 of a point better than 2014. The underlying combined ratio, excluding CATs and prior-year development was 90 for the year, representing 1.5 points of margin improvement.
Recall that 2014 included a $49 million pretax benefit from New York easements. Normalizing for this, the underlying combined ratio improved 2.3 points. This was driven primarily by improved results in workers' compensation, general liability and non-GAAP property losses. Renewal rent and pricing and standard Commercial Lines is 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. In workers' compensation, our largest and most profitable line of business trends continue to emerge favorably, and as a result, pricing is flatted relative to the prior period.
Conversely, commercial oil pricing was in the high single digits reflecting adverse loss experience throughout the year. On the top line, written premium of $6.6 billion was up 4% from 2014, with growth across Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial. Let me provide some details on each of our commercial business units.
In Small Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 86.6, was 0.40 of a point better than 2014. Written premium grew by 4%, driven by strong retentions and $545 million of new business, an increase of $24 million or 5% year-over-year. New business growth in the fourth quarter was the strongest for the year at 9%, capping off another excellent year for this business unit. In the summer of 2015, many of you with us at our operation, where we demonstrated the core building blocks that form the foundation, while market leading small business platform. These include our new technology icon, our underwriting and service centers that handle over 2 million calls annually from customers and agents, and our sales team that is relentless in partnering with distributers. Hopefully, you're better able to appreciate how these capabilities seamlessly intertwine to deliver those results we posted in 2015.
In Middle Market, we made solid progress with the underlying combined ratio of 91.4, improving 3.1 points from 2014. Written premium growth was 3%, was solid throughout the year and new business production of $474 million was up for the third consecutive year. The second half of 2015 was certainly more challenging, and we saw that during the fourth quarter with new business premium down 13%.
We're encouraged by the results in construction and marine, both of which posted strong new business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.8, for the full year, improved from 102 in 2014. This was driven by strong performance improvement in bond and financial products.
National accounts achieved nearly 90% account retention and posted positive written premium growth. Bond written premium growth was modest as we're yet to see a pickup in public construction projects. And financial products gained traction with the growth and Middle Market and technology two strategic priorities for the year.  Overall, Specialty written premiums were up 3%. 
Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered of $185 million in core earnings, down 12% from prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 92, deteriorated 1.4 points from last year, driven mainly by higher auto loss cost and increased non-weather losses in homeowners. In Personal Lines auto, we experienced frequency trends above our expectations in the second half of the year. Our full year frequency trend is under 2% with the third and fourth quarters running at approximately 3.5% to 4%. We saw an increase in the summer months, largely due to increased miles driven. Trends in September and October were quite benign as was the early on November. In December, there was another uptick in frequency, mainly a liability. Some of the claim activity in December, related to November accidents, causing the November frequency to develop several points higher than our initial indication. And we also relatively favorable trends in those months of 2014, setting up challenging comparison for the fourth quarter.
We continue to hone our rate plans and underwriting actions to address these frequency trends as the data matures. But it's clear to us that these patterns are new norm, and will be addressed in our REIT filings. 
Now let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2015 increased to $195 million, up 8% from 2014. That results in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The full year group disability loss ratio was favorable compared to prior year, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline and favorable incidence trends. The group life loss ratio deteriorated due to slightly higher mortality and claims severity.
Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium ex-Association FI increased 4% for the full year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business came in at approximately 90% for the year. And fully insured ongoing sales was $467 million, up $141 million. 
2015 was a very strong year for Group Benefits. First quarter sales were outstanding followed by solid activity throughout the year. The overall loss ratio remains steady and at attractive margins, while the access ratio ex-association FI decreased 1.1. All of these drivers contributed to an increase in the core earnings margin during 2015. We were specially excited to welcome back several large customers as further evidenced of our outstanding service and product capabilities.
As we wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our continued financial progress and by the growing market strength of each of our businesses. Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2016.
Although we are facing near-term pricing and competitive challenges, we remain committed to our long-term objective of profitable growth. Each of our business units has core quarter initiatives underway for 2016. In Small Commercial, we're adding to of digital capabilities, as customers and is revered as demand more access and convenience. And we're expanding our product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate more larger accounts and broader coverage on our platform.
In Middle Market, our priority is coempting effectively at the frontline, leveraging our talent with the tools we've introduced over the past several years. Through advanced training and rigorous analytics, our field underwriters are continuously improving the risk selection and pricing decisions. In product development and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, we are extending our capabilities in industry verticals, such as construction, auto parts manufacturing and hospitality. Taken together, these actions allows us to effectively become a broader middle market player.
Within Specialty Commercial, we rolled out a new risk management platform for national accounts, allowing customers better access to claim data and other information needed by risk managers. This investment further strengthens our value proposition in this competitive market segment, and will allow us to work more closely with our customers to improve long-term account performance.
We expect our overall Commercial Lines margins to remain generally stable, with an underlying combined ratio of between 89 and 91. We will remain disciplined with our pricing and underwriting actions, managing to both long-term lost cost trends as well as individual account performance.
In Personal Lines, we've three overarching goals. The first, is to improve the margins of our products, both auto and homeowners. We're investing in capabilities to better harness data and analytics, and thereby refine and manage our underwriting and pricing. Second, is to maximize the value of our long-term partners ship with ERP. Investments with additional tools, contact service capabilities and direct marketing effectiveness, are all designed to attract and retain to more AARP members. And third, we will leverage the agency channel to target AARP members and other customer segment that value the expertise of agents, who actively seek the benefits of our product suite and value our service model.
We expect to achieve Personal Lines underwriting combined ratio of 90 to 92. In Group Benefits, we're looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings as well as our voluntary product suite. Our current voluntary lineup includes DisabilityFLEX, critical illness and accident. We will add hospital indemnity in the first quarter of 2017. These products along with our enhanced enrollment and marketing tools help individual participants make sound decisions for their unique benefit needs. We expect our Group Benefits core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5.5% and 6%. First quarter 2016 renewal retention is strong as is new sales activity. January sales were well above our 5-year average, but down versus a year ago. Recall that 2015 was in many years -- was in many ways a unique sales year, recovering from low market activity and 2013 and 2014. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of competing in an aggressive and discipline manner. Competition has intensified versus a year ago. We're putting on investments and enhanced capabilities to work to maintain our margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improve financial performance in Personal Lines. We will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth, and we remain committed to smart product and underwriting expansion, building deep partnerships with our distributions and delivering outstanding value to our customers.
In summary, we're very pleased with the successful year in 2015 and are looking forward to continuing our journey in 2016. Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

Today I'm going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.Talcott's full year core earnings summarized on Slide 19, rose 9% from the prior year to",1824,"Thank you, Doug. Today I'm going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.
Talcott's full year core earnings summarized on Slide 19, rose 9% from the prior year to $472 million, much higher than our original outlook due to a tax reserve release, increased limited partnership income and nonroutine investment income such as nickel payments.
Excluding these items, Talcott's results were largely in line with the February 2015 outlook of $340 million to $370 million. On a statutory basis, Talcott's in 2015 increased by approximately $375 million, dividend to the holding company. Year-end surplus was $5 billion, which corresponds to an RBC of approximately 550%. In mid-January of this year, the Connecticut Department approved a $500 million dividend request and it was paid to the holding company last week. This payment completed Talcott's $1.5 billion capital return program that we announced in February last year. In addition, we expect to request a dividend of approximately $250 million in the second half of 2016.
For 2016, we expect Talcott core earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. This outlook is based on the continued runoff of the VA and books and does not include items like tax releases or significant nonroutine investment income that we had in 2015. I would note that our outlook does market value appreciation from year-end 2015 on VA accounts, and therefore there is some sensitivity to market levels.
Statutory results for 2016 will depend on many factors, such as the level of admitted deferred tax assets, cash flow testing results, limited partnership in nonroutine investment income and other items that may create volatility. Based on the underlying assumptions in our outlook, we expect capital generation to be in the $200 million to $300 million level, although, as we experienced in 2015, it can vary a lot between quarters.
Looking forward, our objectives for Talcott have not changed. We expect to maintain Talcott's capital self-sufficiency. Consistent with the past few years, we provided you an update of Talcott's capital margins on slides 30 and 31 in the appendix, which are based on the market scenarios summarized on Slide 32.
Pro forma for the $500 million dividend in January 2016, and the additional $250 million expected in the second half of 2016, Talcott's stress scenario capital margin at year-end 2017 is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion well-above our 200% RBC minimum.
This result gives us confidence that Talcott will continue to return capital to the holding company in 2017, although, the actual amount and timing of 2070 dividends will depend on final 2016 results, market conditions, equity needs as well as the of surplus. And as a reminder, any dividends require regulatory approval.
Given recent capital market volatility, I wanted to touch on our hedging programs for Talcott. First, our hedging programs have been effective against their targets, and due to the sale of we have far less volatility in our reported results. Our hedge program target the economics of the VA liabilities, which means that gains or losses on the hedges mostly offset the changes in the economic liability to policyholders. Within the VA GMW liability, we are largely headed for equity exposure, although not for fees, and we're not entirely hedged for interest rate.
Second, while our hedge programs are key tool for maintaining Talcott's capital self-sufficiency, we will continue to have capital sensitivity to stress scenarios, including credit risk and interest rate exposure on the fixed and institutional annuity blocks. You can see these impacts on Page 32 of the slide, which shows the key changes in capital margin in the stress unfavorable scenarios versus the base case.
Lastly, on Talcott, we completed our annual assumption update in the fourth quarter, which takes into consideration recent experience including withdrawals, surrenders, mortality and operating expenses. We adjusted some assumptions including lowering rates, which had a modest negative impact on fourth quarter net income. 
Turning to investments on Slide 20. Total impairments for the quarter were $107 million. 2015 impairments are up from $63 million in 2014, largely due to impairments on energy and other commodity-related security.
As far our energy-related securities, our holdings totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014, and decline to $2.5 million at year-end as we actively rescued our exposure during the course of the year. We believe these investments are well positioned for our lower for longer oil and commodity environment, and we will continue to manage these holdings.
During the year, we upgraded the average credit quality of our below-investment grade portfolio, which totaled $3.2 billion at year-end 2015. As you can see, on Slide 20, we increased our exposure to BB bonds and decreased our exposure to bonds rated B and below during the year, including some below-investment grade energy exposures.
Turning to Slide 21. Our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships have held that reasonably well, averaging 4.1%, largely consistent with last year. However, excluding non-routine investment items, the yield is down about 10 basis points from 2014.
The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships declined 3.8% in 2015 from 4% the year before, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates.
As a reminder, the P&C yield is lower than the consolidated portfolio due to its shorter duration. Consistent with the decline in yield, 2015 P&C net investment income including limited partnerships declined 4% to $1.17 billion. In total, 2015 core earnings increased 7% to $1.65 billion or $3.88 per diluted share, which you can see on Slide 22. The core ROE rose to 9.2% and 80 basis points improvement from 2014, and book value per diluted shares, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2015, grew 7% to $43.76, compared to 4% growth in 2040.
Taking together the $0.78 in common dividends per share and the increase in 2015 book value per share equates to total value creation of 9% per share. 
Let me provide a quick update on our capital management actions for the last quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased $450 million of share, a little higher than the $425 million we indicated at the Goldman Sachs conference in early December.
We also repaid $160 million of debt that matured in the quarter. For the full year, our equity repurchases totaled $1.3 billion, and we used approximately $800 million to reduce debt, while paying more than $300 million in common stock dividend. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining out of the $4.375 billion authorization for equity repurchases from 2014 through 2016. For debt management, we have $455 million remaining our plan.
I will touch on our 2016 outlook shortly, but wanted to note, that our 2016 outlook assumes the completion of this capital management plan by December 31, 2016.
Turning to Slide 24, I draw your attention to expanded disclosures in the IFS for ROEs. As of December 31, 2014, we began providing legal entity balance sheets on Page 4 of the IFS. Beginning this quarter, we are providing an additional ROE disclosure, so you can now evaluate net income in core earning ROE's in total as well as excluding Talcott. In addition, we've provided individual ROE's for P&C combined companies, Group Benefits and mutual funds. As noted on this chart, our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott was 10.9%. P&C is the largest driver of this result, with the 2015 P&C core earnings ROE of 13.5%. Offset in part by impact of corporate segment, which has a lower ROE due to cash and liquid assets of the holding company.
Talcott's core earning ROE was 6.2%, about 2 percentage points higher than its run rate, adjusted for the tax benefit and favorable investment results in 2015. Increasing our core earnings ROE to exceed our cost of equity capital has been an important goal for The Hartford for the past 2 years. And 2015, we closed that gap by achieving strong financial performance and a lower data, driven by the reduction in risk and volatility as a result of our strategic and financial transformation over the past several years.
Before covering our 2016 core earnings outlook, which you can see on Slide 25, I wanted to let that, this will be the last year that we provide a core earnings-based outlook. Between the business sales in 2013 and 2014 and the financial disclosures that we provide in the IFS and our SEC filings, is much similar company to model. Given many factors that cause a P&C company's results to vary, including catastrophes, prior-year developments and investment returns, the vast majority of its public P&C companies do not provide earnings guidance.
However, we expect to continue to provide our outlook for financial metrics and capital management that will help you develop your earnings forecast.
Turning to 2016, our core earnings outlook is a range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion, summarized on Slide 25. At the midpoint of the range, this equates to growth of about 5% over 2015, normalized for favorable CATs and unfavorable prior development, and excluding Talcott. The table on the slide includes several of the financial metrics included in this outlook, which were included in the news release last night. I would note that this year outlook for P&C net investment income, excluding limited partnership of just over $1 billion, down 3% at the midpoint from 2015.
As I stated earlier, our outlook assumes the completion of our capital management plan. At December 31, 2015, holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion. In addition, we anticipate about $1.1 billion in dividends from our P&C Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses, and $750 million from Talcott in 2016. These amounts are more than sufficient to complete the current capital management plan, while also covering 2016 interest expense and dividends and maintaining holding company liquidity above target level.
Finally, before turning to Q&A, I want to reiterate that 2015 was a successful year both financially and strategically. Our strategy has not changed, and in 2016, we remain confident in our ability to make progress on our operational and financial objectives, as we've done over the past several years.
While markets are more challenging, our financial strength, capital flexibility and underwriting and expense discipline are important competitive advantages that will help us continue to create shareholder value. Chris and Doug shared many of our operational objectives for 2016. In addition to our 2016 outlook, our financial objectives in 2016 and beyond include the following: Continuing to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott; efficiently manage the runoff and return of capital from Talcott while maintaining its capital self-sufficiency; redeploy the excess capital generated by our business to create greater shareholder value; and generate average total value creation of at least 9% as measured by common dividends paid plus growth in book value per diluted share, ex AOCI. Without so we can begin the Q&A session."

Let me just take just step back, and then Doug and I will partner on this one here. So, I think your point on AARP, is still generally true. But if you look at, sort of the progression on activity over the last 12 months, Doug said it earlier, first half of the year is relatively benign from a frequency side. And we're experiencing normal severity trends in the2% to 3%. I think what happened in July and August, we saw a little bit of a pop in frequency. Then, September, October, it went back to sort of normal, 0 to 1% range. And Beth and I had an opportunity to speak at a conference in early December, then we gave an indication that we thought November would be in that 1% range also, and sort of smooth out the year. But as we got into December, we had another sort of blip in frequency. And that impacted our calls on how we thought ultimately, November frequency would develop. So there is a little bit of a lag factor that you have to put on these frequency trends. So when you put the third and fourth quarters together, as Doug said, we're in that 3.5% to 4% range. I think our thesis still is that economic activity defined by lower employment, miles driven up due to lower gasoline prices, coupled with, particularly in November, December, some weather in the Southeast, Midwest and West, whether it would rain, the torrential rains at California, experience from California is our largest Personal Lines state or other weather activity. All that contributed to, I'll call it the increase in frequency incidences. That said, over a longer period of time, the AARP book is still outperforms a mass-market book, so that when we're talking about 3%, 3.5%, 4% frequency increases, we still think that is a lot lower than a broad mass-market increase in frequency. So as Doug said, we are beginning and have, and particular with our fourth quarter filing and a couple of our -- one of our large state, we have, in essence, reflected this new level of activity in our filings. We will continue to do that in '16. And earn net out and manage other actions such as underwriting or agency management actions, as Doug describe. So I think that is the context that would have you to keep in mind. So Doug, would you follow-up?"

I'm thinking about selection and drivers and appetite management and geography, those are all meaningful priorities for us, and we expect over the next year to 2 years, that's point one. Point two is, I don't think that dramatic change in our numbers were quite as dramatic as some of the other carriers we competed with. So, yes, our frequency  was not flat for the second half of the year, but it was mid-single, 3-ish, 3% to 4%.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2015 was a successful year for The Hartford. Core earnings per diluted share increased 15% over 2014. Core earnings ROE rose to 9.2% from 8.4%. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew by 7%. We reduced debt by $750 million, and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders.
Doug and Beth will go into further details of our 2015 performance, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, Property & Casualty had a very strong year. The underlying combined ratio improved 0.5 point to 91, and top line growth continued, reflecting an increase in new business and the benefit of pricing and underwriting actions we have made over the past few years.
Group Benefits had a very strong year. The business generated a 5.6% core earnings margin exceeding our plan and pivoted to growth with a 2% increase in fully insured ongoing premiums.
We continue to execute on our strategy at Talcott Resolution. The business is running off steadily, returning capital to the holding company and our hedge programs are working effectively. Our Mutual Funds business generated $1.5 billion of positive net flows in 2015; increased sales by 15%; and delivered solid relative fund performance. And our ratings where upgraded by A.M. Best, Moody's and S&P, an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance and financial flexibility. 
We delivered these strong financial results and increased our top line momentum, while investing in the capabilities and talent that are making us a broader and deeper risk player, in a more efficient customer-focused company, that can deliver sustainable, profitable growth. For example, the strong talent we attracted to the organization, particularly in underwriting, sales, data and technology, is enabling us to judiciously expand into new market industry verticals. Doug will touch upon this in a moment. 
The investments we made in new systems, such as our claim system, our Group Benefits enrollment system, and our Middle Market underwriting desktop, are both reducing cycle times, and importantly, enhancing the experiences we are delivering to agents and customers.
Our understanding of the business implications of accelerating technological change, shifting demographics and evolving customer expectation, is informing the investments we are making in product, distribution and service, and recent marketing investments have increased the visibility of our iconic brand. For example, our sponsorship of Major League Baseball fully rolls out into 2016, and we recently announced the extension of our 20-plus-year relationship with the U.S. Paralympics to 2020.
As all of you know, the market is becoming increasingly competitive and the investment environment is less favorable. Consolidation amongst carriers as well as agents and brokers has accelerated. Legacy IT platforms are aging and are costly to maintain. We faced disruption from the advent of Big Data, autonomous vehicles and new capital entering the market. Interest rates are low and are expected to be lower for longer. These dynamics are challenging insurance companies to reevaluate their operations and to adapt. We believe that Hartford is well-positioned to address these challenges and to take advantage of the market opportunities they present.
We enter 2016 with a strong portfolio of businesses and capital flexibility. We remain focused on organically growing each of our businesses, and we will explore acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. We will maintain underwriting discipline and tightly manage expenses to support ongoing investments in the capabilities and talent needed to be a top-of-mind company for the products we offer through our distribution partners. And we will continue to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, with business performance and effective capital management that returns excess capital to shareholders.
Our 2016 outlook for core earnings is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion. Excluding Talcott, this range represents core earnings growth of approximately 5%, adjusted for favorable CATs and other items in 2015. We also intend to complete our capital management plan, including the $1.3 billion of share repurchases.
In closing, let me express how proud I am of what we accomplished in 2015, and my sincere thanks to our leadership team, our employees, agents and customers and our investors for their continued support and confidence. We have a clear strategy and experience and stable management team, a powerful national distribution network, differentiated products and a brand that stands for strength and integrity.
As we enter 2016, I am confident in our ability to navigate this dynamic and competitive environment, and continue to create shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."
341546,321573078,928158,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.

I'll provide an overview of our 2015 results in Property & Casualty and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts as we look forward to 2016.
2015 was another year of strong financial performance, with improved results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits. In Personal Lines, results were below our expectations but we remain pleased with the trends of our AARP Direct business and the progress we've made to reposition agency.
Let me get right into our financial results. In Commercial Lines, we delivered over $1 billion of core earnings for the full year on an all-in command ratio of 92.6, 0.8 point better than 2014. The underlying combined ratio, excluding CATs and prior-year development was 90 for the year, representing 1.5 points of margin improvement.
Recall that 2014 included a $49 million pretax benefit from New York assessments. Normalizing for this, the underlying combined ratio improved 2.3 points. This was driven primarily by improved results in workers' compensation, general liability and non-GAAP property losses. Renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines is 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. In workers' compensation, our largest and most profitable line of business, loss trends continue to emerge favorably. And as a result, pricing is flattened relative to the prior period.
Conversely, commercial oil pricing was in the high single digits, reflecting adverse loss experience throughout the year. On the top line, written premium of $6.6 billion was up 4% from 2014, with growth across Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial. Let me provide some details on each of our commercial business units.
In Small Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 86.6, was 0.4 points better than 2014. Written premium grew by 4%, driven by strong retentions and $545 million of new business, an increase of $24 million or 5% year-over-year. New business growth in the fourth quarter was the strongest for the year at 9%, capping off another excellent year for this business unit. 
In the summer of 2015, many of you are with us at our Charlotte operation, where we demonstrated the core building blocks that form the foundation for our market-leading small business platform. These include our new business submission technology icon, our underwriting and service centers that handle over 2 million calls annually from customers and agents, and our sales team that is relentless in partnering with distributors. Hopefully, you're better able to appreciate how these capabilities seamlessly intertwine to deliver the results we posted in 2015.
In Middle Market, we made solid progress with the underlying combined ratio of 91.4, improving 3.1 points from 2014. Written premium growth was 3%, retentions were solid throughout the year, and new business production of $474 million was up for the third consecutive year. The second half of 2015 was certainly more challenging, and we saw that during the fourth quarter with new business premium down 13%.
We're encouraged by the results in construction and marine, both of which posted strong new business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.8, for the full year, improved from 100.2 in 2014. This was driven by strong performance improvement in bond and financial products.
National accounts achieved nearly 90% account retention and posted positive written premium growth. Bond written premium growth was modest as we have yet to see a pick-up in public construction projects. And financial products gained traction with the growth in Middle Market and technology NO,[ph]  2 strategic priorities for the year.  
Overall, Specialty written premiums were up 3%. 
Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered $185 million in core earnings, down 12% from prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 92, deteriorated 1.4 points from last year, driven mainly by higher auto loss cost and increased non-weather losses in homeowners. In Personal Lines auto, we experienced frequency trends above our expectations in the second half of the year. 
Our full year frequency trend is under 2% with the third and fourth quarters running at approximately 3.5% to 4%. We saw an increase in the summer months, largely due to increased miles driven. Trends in September and October were quite benign as was the early read on November. In December, there was another uptick in frequency, mainly a liability. Some of the claim activity in December related to November accidents, causing the November frequency to develop several points higher than our initial indication. And we also had relatively favorable trends in those months of 2014, setting up challenging comparisons for the fourth quarter.
We continue to hone our rate plans and underwriting actions to address these frequency trends as the data matures. But it's clear to us that these patterns are a new norm, and will be addressed in our REIT [ph] filings. 
Now let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2015 increased to $195 million, up 8% from 2014. That results in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The full year group disability loss ratio was favorable compared to prior year, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline and favorable incidence trends. The group life loss ratio deteriorated due to slightly higher mortality and claims severity.
Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium x Association FI increased 4% for the full year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business came in at approximately 90% for the yEar. And fully insured ongoing sales was $467 million, up $141 million. 
2015 was a very strong year for Group Benefits. First quarter sales were outstanding followed by solid activity throughout the year. The overall loss ratio remains steady and at attractive margins, while the expense ratio x Association-FI decreased 1.1 point. All of these drivers contributed to an increase in the core earnings margin during 2015. We were especially excited to welcome back several large customers as further evidence of our outstanding service and product capabilities.
As we wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our continued financial progress and by the growing market strength of each of our businesses. Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2016.
Although we're facing near-term pricing and competitive challenges, we remain committed to our long-term objective of profitable growth. Each of our business units has core initiatives underway for 2016. In Small Commercial, we're adding to our digital capabilities, as customers and distributors demand more access and convenience. And we're expanding our product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate both larger accounts and broader coverage on our platform.
In Middle Market, our priority is competing effectively at the frontline, leveraging our talent with the tools we've introduced over the past several years. Through advanced training and rigorous analytics, our field underwriters are continuously improving the risk selection and pricing decisions. In product development and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, we are extending our capabilities in industry verticals, such as construction, auto parts manufacturing and hospitality. Taken together, these actions allow us to effectively become a broader middle market player.
Within Specialty Commercial, we rolled out a new risk management platform for national accounts, allowing customers better access to claim data and other information needed by risk managers. This investment further strengthens our value proposition in this competitive market segment, and will allow us to work more closely with our customers to improve long-term account performance.
We expect our overall Commercial Lines margins to remain generally stable, with an underlying combined ratio of between 89 and 91. We will remain disciplined with our pricing and underwriting actions, managing to both long-term lost cost trends as well as individual account performance.
In Personal Lines, we have 3 overarching goals. The first is to improve the margins of our products, both auto and homeowners. We're investing in capabilities to better harness data and analytics, and thereby refine and manage our underwriting and pricing. Second is to maximize the value of our long-term partnership with AARP. Investments in digital tools, contact service capabilities and direct marketing effectiveness, are all designed to attract and retain more AARP members. And third, we will leverage the agency channel to target AARP members and other customer segments that value the expertise of agents, who actively seek the benefits of our product suite and value our service model.
We expect to achieve a Personal Lines underwriting combined ratio of 90 to 92. In Group Benefits, we're looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings as well as our voluntary product suite. Our current voluntary lineup includes DisabilityFLEX, critical illness and accident. We will add hospital indemnity in the first quarter 2017. These products, along with our enhanced enrollment and marketing tools, help individual participants make sound decisions for their unique benefit needs. We expect our Group Benefits core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5.5% and 6%. 
First quarter 2016 renewal retention is strong as is new sales activity. January sales are well above our 5-year average but down versus a year ago. Recall that 2015 was in many years -- was in many ways a unique sales year, recovering from low market activity in 2013 and '14. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of competing in an aggressive and disciplined manner. Competition has intensified versus a year ago. We're putting our investments and enhanced capabilities to work to maintain our margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improve financial performance in Personal Lines. We will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth and we remain committed to smart product and underwriting expansion, building deep partnerships with our distributions and delivering outstanding value to our customers.
In summary, we're very pleased with the successful year in 2015 and are looking forward to continuing our journey in 2016. Let me now turn the call over to Beth."
341546,321573078,928158,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Today I'm going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.Talcott's full year core earnings summarized on Slide 19, rose 9% from the prior year to",1859,"Thank you, Doug. Today I'm going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.
Talcott's full year core earnings summarized on Slide 19, rose 9% from the prior year to $472 million, much higher than our original outlook due to a tax reserve release, increased limited partnership income and nonroutine investment income such as make-whole payments.
Excluding these items, Talcott's results were largely in line with the February 2015 outlook of $340 million to $370 million. On a statutory basis, Talcott surplus during 2015 increased by approximately $375 million, before dividend to the holding company. Year-end surplus was $5 billion, which corresponds to an RBC of approximately 550%. In mid-January of this year, the Connecticut Department approved our $500 million dividend request and it was paid to the holding company last week. This payment completed Talcott's $1.5 billion capital return program that we announced in February last year. In addition, we expect to request a dividend of approximately $250 million in the second half of 2016.
For 2016, we expect Talcott core earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. This outlook is based on the continued runoff of the VA and fixed books and does not include items like tax reserve releases or significant nonroutine investment income that we had in 2015. I would note that our outlook does assume market value appreciation from year-end 2015 on VA accounts, and therefore there is some sensitivity to market levels.
Statutory results for 2016 will depend on many factors, such as the level of admitted deferred tax assets, cash flow testing reserve, limited partnership in nonroutine investment income and other items that may create volatility. Based on the underlying assumptions in our outlook, we expect statutory capital generation to be in the $200 million to $300 million level, although, as we experienced during 2015, it can vary a lot between quarters.
Looking forward, our objectives for Talcott have not changed. We expect to maintain Talcott's capital self-sufficiency. Consistent with the past few years, we provided you an update of Talcott's capital margins on slides 30 and 31 in the appendix, which are based on the market scenarios summarized on Slide 32.
Pro forma for the $500 million dividend in January 2016 and the additional $250 million expected in the second half of 2016, Talcott's stress scenario capital margin at year-end 2017 is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion well above our 200% RBC minimum.
This result gives us confidence that Talcott will continue to return capital to the holding company in 2017, although, the actual amount and timing of 2017 dividends will depend on final 2016 results, market conditions, liquidity needs as well as the composition of surplus. And as a reminder, any dividends require regulatory approval.
Given recent capital market volatility, I wanted to touch on our hedging programs for Talcott. First, our hedging programs have been effective against their targets, and due to the sale of Japan we have far less volatility in our reported results. Our hedge programs target the economics of the VA liabilities, which means that gain or losses on the hedges mostly offset the changes in the economic liability to policyholders. Within the VA GMWB liability, we are largely hedged for equity exposure, although not for fees, and we are not entirely hedged for interest rate.
Second, while our hedge programs are key tool for maintaining Talcott's capital self-sufficiency, we will continue to have capital sensitivity to stress scenarios, including credit risk and interest rate exposures on the fixed and institutional annuity blocks. You can see these impacts on Page 32 of the slide, which shows the key changes in capital margins in the stress unfavorable scenarios versus the base case.
Lastly, on Talcott, we completed our annual assumption update in the fourth quarter, which takes into consideration recent experience including withdrawals, surrenders, mortality and operating expenses. We adjusted some assumptions including lowering surrender rates, which had a modest negative impact on fourth quarter net income. 
Turning to investments on Slide 20. Total impairments for the quarter were $107 million. 2015 impairments are up from $63 million in 2014, largely due to intent-to-sell impairments on energy and other commodity-related securities.
As for energy-related securities, our holdings totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014, and declined to $2.5 billion at year-end as we actively reduced our exposure during the course of the year. We believe these investments are well positioned for a lower for longer oil and commodity price environment, and we will continue to manage these holdings.
During the year, we upgraded the average credit quality of our below-investment grade portfolio, which totaled $3.2 billion at year-end 2015. As you can see, on Slide 20, we increased our exposure to BB bonds and decreased our exposure to bonds rated B and below during the year, including some below investment grade energy exposures.
Turning to Slide 21. Our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships have held up reasonably well, averaging 4.1%, largely consistent with last year. However, excluding non-routine investment items, the yield is down about 10 basis points from 2014.
The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, declined to 3.8% in 2015 from 4% the year before, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates.
As a reminder, the P&C yield is lower than the consolidated portfolio due to its shorter duration. Consistent with the decline in yield, 2015 P&C net investment income, including limited partnerships declined 4% to $1.17 billion. In total, 2015 core earnings increased 7% to $1.65 billion or $3.88 per diluted share, which you can see on Slide 22. The core ROE rose to 9.2% and 80 basis points improvement from 2014, and book value per diluted shares, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2015, grew 7% to $43.76, compared to 4% growth in 2014.
Taking together the $0.78 in common dividends per share and the increase in 2015 book value per share x AOCI equates to total value creation of 9% per share. 
Let me provide a quick update on our capital management actions for the last quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased $450 million of shares, a little higher than the $425 million we indicated at the Goldman Sachs conference in early December.
We also repaid $160 million of debt that matured in the quarter. For the full year, our equity repurchases totaled $1.3 billion, and we used approximately $800 million to reduce debt, while paying more than $300 million in common stock dividends. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining out of the $4.375 billion authorization for equity repurchases from 2014 through 2016. For debt management, we have $455 million remaining under our plan.
I'll touch on our 2016 outlook shortly, but wanted to note that our 2016 outlook assumes the completion of this capital management plan by December 31, 2016.
Turning to Slide 24. I draw your attention to expanded disclosures in the IFS for ROEs. As of December 31, 2014, we began providing legal entity balance sheets on Page 4 of the IFS. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional ROE disclosure, so you can now evaluate net income in core earning ROEs in total as well as excluding Talcott. In addition, we have provided individual ROEs for P&C combined companies, Group Benefits and mutual funds. 
As noted on this chart, our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott was 10.9%. P&C is the largest driver of this result, with a 2015 P&C core earnings ROE of 13.5%, offset in part by the impact of the corporate segment, which has a lower ROE due to cash and liquid assets at the holding company.
Talcott's core earning ROE was 6.2%, about 2 percentage points higher than its run rate, adjusted for the tax benefit and favorable investment results in 2015. Increasing our core earnings ROE to exceed our cost of equity capital has been an important goal for The Hartford for the past 2 years. In 2015, we closed that gap by achieving strong financial performance and a lower data, driven by the reduction in risk and volatility as a result of our strategic and financial transformation over the past several years.
Before covering our 2016 core earnings outlook, which you can see on Slide 25, I wanted to let that, this will be the last year that we provide a core earnings-based outlook. Between the business sales in 2013 and 2014 and the financial disclosures that we provide in the IFS and our SEC filings, The Hartford is a much simpler company to analyze and model. Given many factors that cause a P&C company's results to vary, including catastrophes, prior-year developments and investment returns, the vast majority of its public P&C companies do not provide earnings guidance.
However, we expect to continue to provide our outlook for financial metrics and capital management that will help you develop your earnings forecast.
Turning to 2016, our core earnings outlook is a range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion, summarized on Slide 25. At the midpoint of the range, this equates to growth of about 5% over 2015, normalized for favorable CATs and unfavorable prior development, and excluding Talcott. The table on the slide includes several of the financial metrics included in this outlook, which were included in the news released last night. I would note that this year we have an outlook for P&C net investment income, excluding limited partnership of just over $1 billion, down 3% at the midpoint from 2015.
As I stated earlier, our outlook assumes the completion of our capital management plan. At December 31, 2015, holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion. In addition, we anticipate about $1.1 billion in dividends from our P&C Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses, and $750 million from Talcott in 2016. These amounts are more than sufficient to complete the current capital management plan, while also covering 2016 interest expense and dividends and maintaining holding company liquidity above target level.
Finally, before turning to Q&A, I want to reiterate that 2015 was a successful year both financially and strategically. Our strategy has not changed, and in 2016, we remain confident in our ability to make progress on our operational and financial objectives, as we have done over the past several years.
While markets are more challenging, our financial strength, capital flexibility and underwriting and expense discipline are important competitive advantages that will help us continue to create shareholder value. Chris and Doug shared many of our operational objectives for 2016. In addition to our 2016 outlook, our financial objectives in 2016 and beyond include the following: continuing to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott; efficiently manage the runoff and return of capital from Talcott while maintaining its capital self-sufficiency; redeploy the excess capital generated by our business to create greater shareholder value; and generate average total value creation of at least 9% as measured by common dividends paid plus growth in book value per diluted share, x AOCI. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

And thanks for acknowledging the expanded disclosures that the team have put out there. I think it's important, that you really continue to see the progress that we can make going forward. So as really I sit here today, the 10.9% core earnings x Talcott, is described, it really does exceed our cost of equity capital today, which we charge probably in the 9% to 9.5% range. If you look forward, in '16, I do think we could improve that 10.9%. So when I say that, really, what I mean is if you look at the plan that we outlined, including normal CATs we achieved our NII outlook, we maintain in the margins that, Doug and his team are focused on, and we execute the capital management plan, I think that core earnings ROE ex-Talcott could increase by 50% by the end of '16 -- basis points, excuse me, 50 basis points."

So in the case that they haven't leveraged that, we'd rather be contracted with those that are using it. And we think there's great value there, and working like crazy to build a very, very positive profile of customers that value our brand and our AARP members."

Let me just take just a step back and then Doug and I will partner on this one here. So I think your point on AARP is still generally true. But if you look at sort of the progression on activity over the last 12 months, Doug said it earlier, first half of the year is relatively benign from a frequency side. And we're experiencing normal severity trends in the 2% to 3%. I think what happened in July and August, we saw a little bit of a pop in frequency. Then September, October, it went back to sort of normal, 0, 1% range. And Beth and I had an opportunity to speak at a conference in early December, where then we gave an indication that we thought November would be in that 1% range also, and sort of smooth out the year. But as we got into December, we had another sort of blip in frequency. And that impacted our calls on how we thought ultimately, November frequency would develop. So there's a little bit of a lag factor that you have to put on these frequency trends. So when you put the third and fourth quarters together, as Doug said, we're in the 3.5%, 4% range. I think our thesis still is that economic activity defined by low employment, miles driven up due to lower gasoline prices, coupled with, particularly in November, December, some weather in the southeast, Midwest and west, whether it be rain, the torrential rains that California experienced, and California is our largest Personal Lines state or other weather activity. All that contributed to, I'll call it, the increase in frequency incidences. That said, over a longer period of time, the AARP book is still outperforms a mass-market book, so that when we're talking about 3%, 3.5%, 4% frequency increases, we still think that is a lot lower than a broad mass-market increase in frequency. So as Doug said, we are beginning and have, and particularly with our fourth quarter filing and a couple of our -- one of our large state, we have, in essence, reflected this new level of activity in our filings. We'll continue to do that in '16 and earn that out and manage other actions such as underwriting or agency management actions, as Doug described. So I think that is the context that we'd have you to keep in mind. So Doug, would you follow-up?"

One is I would not underestimate our view of how much the non-rate activity should improve our performance over time, Randy. So these agency actions and really becoming a better underwriter, I'm thinking about selection and undisclosed drivers and appetite management and geography, those are all meaningful priorities for us, and we expect over the next year to 2 years, that's point one. Point two is, I don't think that dramatic change in our numbers were quite as dramatic as some of the other carriers we competed with. So yes, our frequency  was not flat for the second half of the year, but it was mid-single, 3-ish, 3% to 4%. So that's not 8%, 10%, 12%, it's having an impact on our filings, it will be proportional to state. But we wanted to send the message today that we're not just at a point where we're thinking, it was a blip on the radar and we're not going to adjust our patterns going forward."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2015 was a successful year for The Hartford. Core earnings per diluted share increased 15% over 2014. Core earnings ROE rose to 9.2% from 8.4%. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew by 7%. We reduced debt by $750 million, and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders.
Doug and Beth will go into further details of our 2015 performance, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, Property & Casualty had a very strong year. The underlying combined ratio improved 0.5 point to 91, and top line growth continued, reflecting an increase in new business and the benefit of pricing and underwriting actions we have made over the past few years.
Group Benefits had a very strong year. The business generated a 5.6% core earnings margin, exceeding our plan, and pivoted to growth with a 2% increase in fully insured ongoing premiums.
We continue to execute on our strategy at Talcott Resolution. The business is running off steadily, returning capital to the holding company, and our hedge programs are working effectively. Our Mutual Funds business generated $1.5 billion of positive net flows in 2015, increased sales by 15% and delivered solid relative fund performance. And our ratings where upgraded by A.M. Best, Moody's and S&P, an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance and financial flexibility. 
We delivered these strong financial results and increased our top line momentum while investing in the capabilities and talent that are making us a broader and deeper risk player, in a more efficient customer-focused company that can deliver sustainable, profitable growth. For example, the strong talent we attracted to the organization, particularly in underwriting, sales, data and technology, is enabling us to judiciously expand into new market industry verticals. Doug will touch upon this in a moment. 
The investments we made in new systems, such as our claim system, our Group Benefits enrollment system, and our Middle Market underwriting desktop, are both reducing cycle times and, importantly, enhancing the experiences we are delivering to agents and customers.
Our understanding of the business implications of accelerating technological change, shifting demographics and evolving customer expectations, is informing the investments we are making in product, distribution and service, and recent marketing investments have increased the visibility of our iconic brand. For example, our sponsorship of Major League Baseball fully rolls out into 2016, and we recently announced the extension of our 20-plus-year relationship with the U.S. Paralympics through 2020.
As all of you know, the market is becoming increasingly competitive, and the investment environment is less favorable. Consolidation amongst carriers as well as agents and brokers has accelerated. Legacy IT platforms are aging and are costly to maintain. We faced disruption from the advent of Big Data, autonomous vehicles and new capital entering the market. Interest rates are low and are expected to be lower for longer. These dynamics are challenging insurance companies to reevaluate their operations and to adapt. We believe that Hartford is well-positioned to address these challenges and to take advantage of the market opportunities they present.
We enter 2016 with a strong portfolio of businesses and capital flexibility. We remain focused on organically growing each of our businesses, and we will explore acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. We will maintain underwriting discipline and tightly manage expenses to support ongoing investments in the capabilities and talent needed to be a top-of-mind company for the products we offer through our distribution partners. And we will continue to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, with business performance and effective capital management that returns excess capital to shareholders.
Our 2016 outlook for core earnings is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion. Excluding Talcott, this range represents core earnings growth of approximately 5%, adjusted for favorable CATs and other items in 2015. We also intend to complete our capital management plan, including the $1.3 billion of share repurchases.
In closing, let me express how proud I am of what we accomplished in 2015, and my sincere thanks to our leadership team, our employees, agents and customers and our investors for their continued support and confidence. We have a clear strategy, an experienced and stable management team, a powerful national distribution network, differentiated products and a brand that stands for strength and integrity.
As we enter 2016, I am confident in our ability to navigate this dynamic and competitive environment and continue to create shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

I'll provide an overview of our 2015 results in Property & Casualty and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts as we look forward to 2016.
2015 was another year of strong financial performance, with improved results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits. In Personal Lines, results were below our expectations but we remain pleased with the trends of our AARP Direct business and the progress we've made to reposition agency.
Let me get right into our financial results. In Commercial Lines, we delivered over $1 billion of core earnings for the full year on an all-in combined ratio of 92.6, 0.8 point better than 2014. The underlying combined ratio, excluding CATs and prior-year development was 90 for the year, representing 1.5 points of margin improvement.
Recall that 2014 included a $49 million pretax benefit from New York assessments. Normalizing for this, the underlying combined ratio improved 2.3 points. This was driven primarily by improved results in workers' compensation, general liability and non-CAT property losses. Renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines is 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. In workers' compensation, our largest and most profitable line of business, loss trends continue to emerge favorably. And as a result, pricing has flattened relative to the prior period.
Conversely, commercial [indiscernible] pricing was in the high single digits, reflecting adverse loss experience throughout the year. On the top line, written premium of $6.6 billion was up 4% from 2014, with growth across Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial. Let me provide some details on each of our commercial business units.
In Small Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 86.6, was 0.4 points better than 2014. Written premium grew by 4%, driven by strong retentions and $545 million of new business, an increase of $24 million or 5% year-over-year. New business growth in the fourth quarter was the strongest for the year at 9%, capping off another excellent year for this business unit. 
In the summer of 2015, many of you were with us at our Charlotte operation, where we demonstrated the core building blocks that form the foundation of our market-leading small business platform. These include our new business submission technology, ICON; our underwriting and service centers that handle over 2 million calls annually from customers and agents; and our sales team that is relentless in partnering with distributors. Hopefully, you're better able to appreciate how these capabilities seamlessly intertwine to deliver the results we posted in 2015.
In Middle Market, we made solid progress with the underlying combined ratio of 91.4, improving 3.1 points from 2014. Written premium growth was 3%, retentions were solid throughout the year, and new business production of $474 million was up for a third consecutive year. The second half of 2015 was certainly more challenging, and we saw that during the fourth quarter with new business premium down 13%.
We're encouraged by the results in construction and marine, both of which posted strong new business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.8, for the full year, improved from 100.2 in 2014. This was driven by strong performance improvement in bond and financial products.
National accounts achieved nearly 90% account retention and posted positive written premium growth. Bond written premium growth was modest, as we have yet to see a pick-up in public construction projects. And financial products gained traction with the growth in Middle Market and technology E&O, 2 strategic priorities for the year.  
Overall, Specialty written premiums were up 3%. 
Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered $185 million in core earnings, down 12% from prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 92 deteriorated 1.4 points from last year, driven mainly by higher auto loss cost and increased non-weather losses in homeowners. In Personal Lines auto, we experienced frequency trends above our expectations in the second half of the year. 
Our full year frequency trend is under 2% with the third and fourth quarters running at approximately 3.5% to 4%. We saw an increase in the summer months, largely due to increased miles driven. Trends in September and October were quite benign as was the early read on November. In December, there was another uptick in frequency, mainly a liability. Some of the claim activity in December related to November accidents, causing the November frequency to develop several points higher than our initial indication. And we also had relatively favorable trends in those months of 2014, setting up challenging comparisons for the fourth quarter.
We continue to hone our rate plans and underwriting actions to address these frequency trends as the data matures. But it's clear to us that these patterns are a new norm, and will be addressed in our rate filings. 
Now let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2015 increased to $195 million, up 8% from 2014. That results in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The full year group disability loss ratio was favorable compared to prior year, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline and favorable incidence trends. The group life loss ratio deteriorated due to slightly higher mortality and claims severity.
Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium ex Association-FI increased 4% for the full year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business came in at approximately 90% for the year. And fully insured ongoing sales was $467 million, up $141 million. 
2015 was a very strong year for Group Benefits. First quarter sales were outstanding followed by solid activity throughout the year. The overall loss ratio remains steady and at attractive margins, while the expense ratio ex Association-FI decreased 1.1 point. All of these drivers contributed to an increase in the core earnings margin during 2015. We were especially excited to welcome back several large customers as further evidence of our outstanding service and product capabilities.
As we wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our continued financial progress and by the growing market strength of each of our businesses. Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2016.
Although we're facing near-term pricing and competitive challenges, we remain committed to our long-term objective of profitable growth. Each of our business units has core initiatives underway for 2016. In Small Commercial, we're adding to our digital capabilities, as customers and distributors demand more access and convenience. And we're expanding our product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate both larger accounts and broader coverage on our platform.
In Middle Market, our priority is competing effectively at the frontline, leveraging our talent with the tools we've introduced over the past several years. Through advanced training and rigorous analytics, our field underwriters are continuously improving our risk selection and pricing decisions. In product development and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, we are extending our capabilities in industry verticals such as construction, auto parts manufacturing and hospitality. Taken together, these actions allow us to effectively become a broader middle market player.
Within Specialty Commercial, we rolled out a new risk management platform for national accounts, allowing customers better access to claim data and other information needed by risk managers. This investment further strengthens our value proposition in this competitive market segment, and will allow us to work more closely with our customers to improve long-term account performance.
We expect our overall Commercial Lines margins to remain generally stable, with an underlying combined ratio of between 89 and 91. We will remain disciplined with our pricing and underwriting actions, managing to both long-term loss cost trends as well as individual account performance.
In Personal Lines, we have 3 overarching goals. The first is to improve the margins of our products, both auto and homeowners. We're investing in capabilities to better harness data and analytics, and thereby refine and manage our underwriting and pricing. Second is to maximize the value of our long-term partnership with AARP. Investments in digital tools, contact service capabilities and direct marketing effectiveness are all designed to attract and retain more AARP members. And third, we will leverage the agency channel to target AARP members and other customer segments that value the expertise of agents, who actively seek the benefits of our product suite and who value our service model.  We expect to achieve a Personal Lines underwriting combined ratio of 90 to 92. 
In Group Benefits, we're looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings as well as our voluntary product suite. Our current voluntary lineup includes DisabilityFLEX, critical illness and accident. We will add hospital indemnity in the first quarter 2017. These products, along with our enhanced enrollment and marketing tools, help individual participants make sound decisions for their unique benefit needs. We expect our Group Benefits core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5.5% and 6%. 
First quarter 2016 renewal retention is strong, as is new sales activity. January sales are well above our 5-year average but down versus a year ago. Recall that 2015 was in many years -- was in many ways a unique sales year, recovering from low market activity in 2013 and '14. 
Overall, 2016 will be a year of competing in an aggressive and disciplined manner. Competition has intensified versus a year ago. We're putting our investments and enhanced capabilities to work to maintain our margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improve financial performance in Personal Lines. We will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth, and we remain committed to smart product and underwriting expansion, building deep partnerships with our distributions and delivering outstanding value to our customers.
In summary, we're very pleased with a successful year in 2015 and are looking forward to continuing our journey in 2016. Let me now turn the call over to Beth."
341546,321573078,928229,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Today I'm going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.Talcott's full year core earnings, summarized on Slide 19, rose 9% from the prior year to",1857,"Thank you, Doug. Today I'm going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.
Talcott's full year core earnings, summarized on Slide 19, rose 9% from the prior year to $472 million, much higher than our original outlook due to a tax reserve release, increased limited partnership income and nonroutine investment income such as make-whole payments.
Excluding these items, Talcott's results were largely in line with the February 2015 outlook of $340 million to $370 million. On a statutory basis, Talcott surplus during 2015 increased by approximately $375 million, before dividends to the holding company. Year-end surplus was $5 billion, which corresponds to an RBC of approximately 550%. In mid-January of this year, the Connecticut Department approved our $500 million dividend request, and it was paid to the holding company last week. This payment completed Talcott's $1.5 billion capital return program that we announced in February last year. In addition, we expect to request a dividend of approximately $250 million in the second half of 2016.
For 2016, we expect Talcott core earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. This outlook is based on the continued runoff of the VA and fixed books and does not include items like tax reserve releases or significant nonroutine investment income that we had in 2015. I would note that our outlook does assume market value appreciation from year-end 2015 on VA accounts, and therefore there is some sensitivity to market levels.
Statutory results for 2016 will depend on many factors, such as the level of admitted deferred tax assets, cash flow testing reserves, limited partnership in nonroutine investment income and other items that may create volatility. Based on the underlying assumptions in our outlook, we expect statutory capital generation to be in the $200 million to $300 million level, although, as we experienced during 2015, it can vary a lot between quarters.
Looking forward, our objectives for Talcott have not changed. We expect to maintain Talcott's capital self-sufficiency. Consistent with the past few years, we provided you an update of Talcott's capital margins on slides 30 and 31 in the appendix, which are based on the market scenarios summarized on Slide 32.
Pro forma for the $500 million dividend in January 2016 and the additional $250 million expected in the second half of 2016, Talcott's stress scenario capital margin at year-end 2017 is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, well above our 200% RBC minimum.
This result gives us confidence that Talcott will continue to return capital to the holding company in 2017, although the actual amount and timing of 2017 dividends will depend on final 2016 results, market conditions, liquidity needs as well as the composition of surplus. And as a reminder, any dividends require regulatory approval.
Given recent capital market volatility, I wanted to touch on our hedging programs for Talcott. First, our hedging programs have been effective against their targets, and due to the sale of Japan we have far less volatility in our reported results. Our hedge programs target the economics of the VA liabilities, which means that gains or losses on the hedges mostly offset the changes in the economic liability to policyholders. Within the VA GMWB liability, we are largely hedged for equity exposure, although not for fees, and we are not entirely hedged for interest rates.
Second, while our hedge programs are a key tool for maintaining Talcott's capital self-sufficiency, we will continue to have capital sensitivity to stress scenarios, including credit risk and interest rate exposures on the fixed and institutional annuity blocks. You can see these impacts on Page 32 of the slide, which shows the key changes in capital margins in the stress and favorable scenarios versus the base case.
Lastly on Talcott, we completed our annual assumption update in the fourth quarter, which takes into consideration recent experience including withdrawals, surrenders, mortality and operating expenses. We adjusted some assumptions, including lowering surrender rates, which had a modest negative impact on fourth quarter net income. 
Turning to investments on Slide 20. Total impairments for the quarter were $107 million. 2015 impairments are up from $63 million in 2014, largely due to intent-to-sell impairments on energy and other commodity-related securities.
As for energy-related securities, our holdings totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014, and declined to $2.5 billion at year-end as we actively reduced our exposure during the course of the year. We believe these investments are well positioned for a lower-for-longer oil and commodity price environment, and we will continue to manage these holdings.
During the year, we upgraded the average credit quality of our below-investment-grade portfolio, which totaled $3.2 billion at year-end 2015. As you can see, on Slide 20, we increased our exposure to BB bonds and decreased our exposure to bonds rated B and below during the year, including some below-investment-grade energy exposures.
Turning to Slide 21. Our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, have held up reasonably well, averaging 4.1%, largely consistent with last year. However, excluding non-routine investment items, the yield is down about 10 basis points from 2014.
The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, declined to 3.8% in 2015 from 4% the year before, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates.
As a reminder, the P&C yield is lower than the consolidated portfolio due to its shorter duration. Consistent with the decline in yield, 2015 P&C net investment income, including limited partnerships, declined 4% to $1.17 billion. In total, 2015 core earnings increased 7% to $1.65 billion or $3.88 per diluted share, which you can see on Slide 22. The core ROE rose to 9.2%, an 80 basis point improvement from 2014, and book value per diluted shares, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2015, grew 7% to $43.76, compared to 4% growth in 2014.
Taking together the $0.78 in common dividends per share and the increase in 2015 book value per share ex AOCI equates to total value creation of 9% per share. 
Let me provide a quick update on our capital management actions for the last quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased $450 million of shares, a little higher than the $425 million we indicated at the Goldman Sachs conference in early December.
We also repaid $160 million of debt that matured in the quarter. For the full year, our equity repurchases totaled $1.3 billion, and we used approximately $800 million to reduce debt, while paying more than $300 million in common stock dividends. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining out of the $4.375 billion authorization for equity repurchases from 2014 through 2016. For debt management, we have $455 million remaining under our plan.
I'll touch on our 2016 outlook shortly, but wanted to note that our 2016 outlook assumes the completion of this capital management plan by December 31, 2016.
Turning to Slide 24. I draw your attention to expanded disclosures in the IFS for ROEs. As of December 31, 2014, we began providing legal entity balance sheets on Page 4 of the IFS. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional ROE disclosures, so you can now evaluate net income and core earning ROEs in total as well as excluding Talcott. In addition, we have provided individual ROEs for P&C combined companies, Group Benefits and mutual funds. 
As noted on this chart, our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 10.9%. P&C is the largest driver of this result, with a 2015 P&C core earnings ROE of 13.5%, offset in part by the impact of the corporate segment, which has a lower ROE due to cash and liquid assets at the holding company.
Talcott's core earning ROE was 6.2%, about 2 percentage points higher than its run rate, adjusted for the tax benefit and favorable investment results in 2015. Increasing our core earnings ROE to exceed our cost of equity capital has been an important goal for The Hartford over the past few years. In 2015, we closed that gap by achieving strong financial performance at a lower beta, driven by the reduction in risk and volatility as a result of our strategic and financial transformation over the past several years.
Before covering our 2016 core earnings outlook, which you can see on Slide 25, I wanted to let you know that this will be the last year that we provide a core earnings-based outlook. Between the business sales in 2013 and 2014 and the financial disclosures that we provide in the IFS and our SEC filings, The Hartford is a much simpler company to analyze and model. Given many factors that cause a P&C company's results to vary, including catastrophes, prior-year developments and investment returns, the vast majority of public P&C companies do not provide earnings guidance.  However, we expect to continue to provide our outlook for financial metrics and capital management that will help you develop your earnings forecasts.
Turning to 2016, our core earnings outlook is a range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion, summarized on Slide 25. At the midpoint of the range, this equates to growth of about 5% over 2015, normalized for favorable CATs and unfavorable prior development, and excluding Talcott. The table on the slide includes several of the financial metrics included in this outlook, which were included in the news released last night. I would note that this year we have an outlook for P&C net investment income, excluding limited partnerships, of just over $1 billion, down 3% at the midpoint from 2015.
As I stated earlier, our outlook assumes the completion of our capital management plan. At December 31, 2015, holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion. In addition, we anticipate about $1.1 billion in dividends from our P&C Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses, and $750 million from Talcott in 2016. These amounts are more than sufficient to complete the current capital management plans, while also covering 2016 interest expense and dividends and maintaining holding company liquidity above target levels.
Finally, before turning to Q&A, I want to reiterate that 2015 was a successful year both financially and strategically. Our strategy has not changed, and in 2016, we remain confident in our ability to make progress on our operational and financial objectives, as we have done over the past several years.
While markets are more challenging, our financial strength, capital flexibility and underwriting and expense discipline are important competitive advantages that will help us continue to create shareholder value. Chris and Doug shared many of our operational objectives for 2016. In addition to our 2016 outlook, our financial objectives in 2016 and beyond include the following: continuing to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott; efficiently manage the runoff and return of capital from Talcott while maintaining its capital self-sufficiency; redeploy the excess capital generated by our business to create greater shareholder value; and generate average total value creation of at least 9% as measured by common dividends paid plus growth in book value per diluted share, ex AOCI. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

And thanks for acknowledging the expanded disclosures that Beth and the team have put out there. We think it's important that you really continue to see the progress that we can make going forward. So as really I sit here today, the 10.9% core earnings ex Talcott, as Beth described, it really does exceed our cost of equity capital today, which we judge probably in the 9% to 9.5% range. 
If I look forward, in '16, I do think we could improve that 10.9%. So when I say that, really, what I mean is if you look at the plan that we outlined, including normal CATs, we achieve our NII outlook, we maintain in the margins that Doug and his team are focused on, and we execute the capital management plan, I think that core earnings ROE ex Talcott could increase by 50% by the end of '16 -- basis points, excuse me, 50 basis points."

I think across the market place, and historically against our own book of business, we're in a very solid spot and would like to grow and maintain that margin going forward.

In the middle arena, a bit more duration-matched year. So this is a book of business that has improved mightily over the past 4 years. We're watching the yield curve, because duration does matter. Workers' comp is a key line here, as it is in small. It's been a while since I've reported a quarter with 89 xx in the middle in my career. So I'm pleased with progress. 
I would say that between the pricing environment that we continue to compete in and the yield environment that affects our portfolio, we're going to stay close to those dynamics and be thoughtful in terms of our choices, risk by risk, as we move through time. And also, as Chris has shared with you, we have geography goals, and we think there are other places in the country that we can find and build new relationships and be able to leverage our products that are really very solid in the marketplace.

So agents across our platform are very vital to our success. So when we talk about shrinking agents,  particularly in the independent agency side, I think it's important you have the context of market segment. 
So our strategy here is to have meaningful relationships with our independent agents, as defined as being a top-3 carrier in their agency plan. That will dictate, I'll call it, long-term success with retention, growth and profitability. Those agencies, particularly in Personal Lines that we don't have that type of relationship with is the targeted area here for shrinking. 
On the other side, particularly given our AARP relationship and the importance of agents to certain AARP members that want advice and counsel, we want to continue to support those independent agents that have the ability to attract and retain AARP customers for the long term. So it's very targeted here, our actions. So I don't want you to have the impression that we're getting out of independent agency channel in Personal Lines.

And secondly, my comment about the number of agents that have been deauthorized for AARP, those are essentially relationships that had not leveraged the value of what we thought we brought to the table with this enhanced offering. So in the case that they haven't leveraged that, we'd rather be contracted with those that are using it.

Let me just take just a step back, and then Doug and I will partner on this one here. So I think your point on AARP is still generally true. But if you look at sort of the progression of activity over the last 12 months, Doug said it earlier, first half of the year is relatively benign from a frequency side. And we were experiencing normal severity trends in the 2% to 3%. I think what happened in July and August, we saw a little bit of a pop in frequency. Then September, October, it went back to sort of normal, in that 0, 1% range. And Beth and I had an opportunity to speak at a conference in early December, where then we gave an indication that we thought November would be in that 1% range also, and sort of smooth out the year. But as we got into December, we had another sort of blip in frequency. And that impacted our calls on how we thought ultimately November frequency would develop. So there's a little bit of a lag factor that you have to put on these frequency trends.  So when you put the third and fourth quarters together, as Doug said, we're in the 3.5%, 4% range. 
I think our thesis still is that economic activity, defined by low employment; miles driven up due to lower gasoline prices; coupled with, particularly in November, December, some weather in the Southeast, Midwest and West, whether it be rain, the torrential rains that California experienced -- and California is our largest Personal Lines state -- or other weather activity; all that contributed to, I'll call it, the increase in frequency incidences. 
That said, over a longer period of time, the AARP book is still outperforms a mass-market book, so that when we're talking about 3%, 3.5%, 4% frequency increases, we still think that is a lot lower than a broad mass-market increase in frequency. So as Doug said, we are beginning and have, and particularly with our fourth quarter filing and a couple of our -- one of our large states, we have, in essence, reflected this new level of activity in our filings. We'll continue to do that in '16 and earn that out and manage other actions, such as underwriting or agency management actions, as Doug described.

Point two is, I don't think the dramatic change in our numbers were quite as dramatic as some of the other carriers we competed with. So yes, our frequency was not flat for the second half of the year, but it was mid-single, 3-ish, 3% to 4%. So that's not 8%, 10%, 12%. It's having an impact on our filings. It will be proportional to state.

I'm generally pleased with our results this quarter, particularly in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, each of which delivered strong margins. We grew book value per share, excluding AOCI 7% over the past year, and achieved a 10.3% core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott. We repurchased 350 million shares during the quarter, and plan to complete our buyback program by the end of 2016.
However, core earnings were down 15% over last year, as we continue to face some of the same headwinds from the second half of 2015. First, personal auto lost cost trends remain challenging, which impacted margins and led to strengthening reserves for the 2014 and 2015 accident years. Second, Commercial Lines performance has been very strong, with compensation continues to intensify making it more challenging to grow at acceptable returns. And third, consistent with capital market activity, limited partnership investment income remained low similar to the second half of 2015, with an annualized yield of only 1%.
This was a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015 returns averaged 14%. Given these headwinds, I'm pleased with the continued progress we have made in most of our lines of business. Doug and Beth will go into further detail about first quarter performance. But I would like to jump on a few highlights, both positive and negative. We generated strong margins in Commercial Lines supported by underwriting discipline across all of our businesses. All-in combined ratio improved 4.8 points due to lower catastrophes and higher favorable prior-year development, while the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, improved 2.8 points to 89.6. Group Benefits remained strong with core earnings after tax margin of 5.5%, topline growth from good January sales performance and solid book persistency.
Although Mutual Funds core earnings were down slightly, the business continues to deliver steady investment performance and had positive flows and equity funds. In February, the earnings recognized are 2015 investment performance, naming Hartford Funds as a top 10 fund family for the third time in the last 4 years.
While many of our businesses sustained their track record of underwriting improvement, Personal Lines results were disappointing overall. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, improved slightly to 89.7, but this was entirely attributable to the very strong homeowner results due to lower weather and fire losses.
However, personal auto results deteriorated with a 1.6. increase in the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior-year developments. Doug will talk about the underlying trends that contributed to these results as well as the initiatives we have underway to improve profitability, including pricing action.
Given these trends and the time needed to implement responsive actions that earn in, we currently expect the 2016 Personal Lines combined ratios, excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, to be at or above the high end of the 90 to 92 outlook we provided in February. 
Turning from our financial results, we like to provide an update on a few recent investments in products and distribution to make us a broader and deeper risk player.
On March 16, we announced our agreement to acquire Maxum Specialty Insurance Group, a well-respected insurer with an experienced management team and a strong underwriting culture. The addition of Maxum will further strengthen our market in small commercial by extending our product capabilities, adding talent and helping to improve the customer and agent experience. We are hard at work in our integration plans. Our management team recently spent time with Maxim employees, introducing them to the extended team and the opportunities The Hartford will bring to their business. In terms of the transaction process, we filed our Form A with the regulator this month, and expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter. We are all eager to begin working together and to demonstrate the power of our joint capability once this deal closes.
We also announced the expansion of our international insurance placement capabilities or Commercial Lines customers. Our new alliance with Axa Corporate Solution, enables us to offer U.S. customers coverage for their international exposures, with a primary focus on developed markets such as Europe and Asia. The Hartford will maintain underwriting and pricing control of these policies and will assume a 100% of the risks through a reinsurance agreements with
Aside from these 2 projects, we're hard at work on other initiatives in investments to accelerate premium growth and improve our operating capabilities. I look forward to showing our progress with you in the future.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I would like to comment on some of the changing dynamics in the P&C industry. Some carriers are or refocusing their business is due to poor underwriting results, while others are undergoing strategic and leadership changes. Technology-based disruption is accelerating effective all industry participants. At the same time, we see competition intensifying, continued low interest rates and loss cost challenges such as in personal auto. We recognize that these challenges posed by these dynamics, and I remain confident in our ability to navigate this more difficult environment, including the work we acquired in Personal Lines. The Hartford has a strong foundation and an experienced biggest management team with the resolve to maintain underwriting discipline and expense control. We are reacting to these changes in our landscape and are focused on execution.
Now, I will turn the call over to Doug."

We started 2016 with strong results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, continuing our solid execution from 2015 and successfully adapting to a changing competitive landscape.
Results in Personal Lines were disappointing as we took reserve actions to address emerging auto liability loss cost trends. I will share more in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits in a moment, but first I would like to cover our results for Personal Lines.
Core earnings for Personal Lines were $23 million for the quarter, down from $75 million last year. Catastrophe losses were $22 million higher than in 2015, which was a particularly light CAT quarter for Personal Lines. First quarter of 2016 included several well-documented storms in Texas, where we have teams currently deployed to assist our customers. Also included in core earnings this quarter, is $65 million pretax of adverse auto liability development, primarily related to accident years 2014 and 2015, partially offset by favorable development in property.
The adverse auto liabilities year for accident year 2014 resulted from injuries severity trend with losses emerging more slowly than we expected. As more claims from this accident year reaching settlement, we recognize that our previous reserve estimates were too optimistic. For accident year 2015, our auto liability booking reflects the higher severity estimates that carryforward from 2014 as well as increased frequency trends. Our revised estimate of ultimate frequenCAY trend for the third and fourth quarter of 2015, is now approximately 1 to 2 points higher that we estimated at year end, reflecting the continued reporting of injury claims from those accident quarters. That puts our frequency call for the second half of 2015 in the mid-single-digit range.
The Personal Lines underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior period development and catastrophes was 89.7, improving 2/10 of point from last year. Favorable non-catastrophes homeowner losses and a lower expense ratio, more than offset adverse auto losses. Frequency, which picked up in the second half of 2015, appears to be moderating somewhat in the current accident quarter at 2%. Severity on the other hand is notched up to 4%. Overall, we believe that our loss cost trends are consistent with recent quarters. However, as frequency and severe matures, our accident quarter estimates may change. As we continue to analyze the underlying trends and understand what is driving them, we nevertheless, recognize that we need to take actions to address the profitability of our auto book. We're working aggressively on several fronts. First, our rate filings in the first quarter of 2016 were double the number from first quarter of last year, representing an average rate change in the applicable territories of 6.5%. The number of rate filings we've planned for the full year is 40% higher than in 2015, with an average increase in those territories of 6.6% indirect and 8.5% in Given that we mainly issued 12-month policies, much of the 2016 filed rate change will earn into the book in 2017.
Second, in addition to addressing the underlying market trends with rate, we're taking other targeted actions to improve our profitability. In agency, we've terminated 2,200 unproductive relationships, deauthorized 2,300 agents from the AARP program and rolled out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. Agency written premium was down 8% in the quarter; however, ERP agency was up 6. We expect this shift in business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partners agent to contribute to improve profitability overtime.
On the direct side, we're targeting our marketing spend to more adequately priced customer segments and addressing underperformed business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. Our program with ARPA remains the cornerstone of this business. We are confident that we have headroom for growth with the current base, and as a seen over many years with this business, we will continue to deliver both strong customer value and profitability.
While Personal Lines clearly has challenges to address, I'm very pleased with our results in Commercial Lines, where we continue to prioritize pretensions and margins over growth amid increasing competition. We delivered core earnings of $249 million with the combined ratio of 91.1. This was an earnings increase of $15 million from first quarter 2015 and a combined ratio improvement of 4.8 points. Lower property losses, favorable prior year development and improved workers' compensation margins, were largely offset by a decline in net investment income of $37 million after-tax. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $14 million less than in 2015. While first quarter catastrophe losses were above our expectations in both 2016 and 2015, this is typical volatility associated with strong activity.
Intense weather in the Southwest, particularly late in the quarter, has continued into April and we are fully engaged to meet the needs of our customers. pricing and standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to the fourth quarter of 2015. I'm very pleased with this outcome and our continued balance of retention, pricing and new business.
Loss trend in worker's compensation remain favorable and returns are within our target range. We released worker's compensation reserves across Commercial Lines, reacting to the favorable emerged frequency we've experienced in more recent accident years along with the continued benign severity trends. We had adverse development in general liability, including the GO component of the Small Commercial package business, often referred as business owners policy or BOP.
Within certain risk classes, we've seen an increase in claims with greater complexity and likelihood of litigation. Losses on these claims are tended to emerge much more slowly and we have revised our estimates accordingly.
Looking at Small Commercial. The business continues to perform extremely well. The strong margins posted again this quarter along with the continued top line growth, reflect the momentum we've generated in this key market segment for us. The underlying combined ratio was 86.7, 2.9 points better than last year. The improvement was driven mainly by favorable non-catastrophes property losses and a modest improvement in worker's compensation results. Written premium was 2% in the quarter reflecting strong retention and solid new business flow, even as competitive conditions intensified. New business of $146 million was up 4% from 2015.
Moving over to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 92, improving 1.7 points from first quarter of 2015. the improvement is largely driven by favorable non-catastrophes property losses and continued margin improvement in worker's compensation. Written premium declined 4% in the quarter. We're pleased with our intentions and ability to maintain solid pricing levels. However, new business was down $21 million versus last year. Our submission flow was off 7% this quarter versus a year ago as well as more accounts falling outside our underwriting and rate I suspect that higher retentions across our competitors, coupled with our targeted underwriting message, are driving this result.
We expect moderated new business levels over the next few quarters as we balance growth aspirations with our objective to maintain the improved profitability that we worked hard to achieve.
Within Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 94.3, improved 4.8 points versus prior year reflecting particularly strong margin improvement in National Accounts and Financial Products. Favorable prior year development in Financial Products contributed to Specialty Commercial combined ratio of 76.5. This is based on our continued favorable experience in D&O. National Accounts continues to perform well in the market conditions very similar to Middle Market. Competition is intense, but we're comfortable with our intentions and the new business accounts we're remaining.
Finally, circling back to Group Benefits, we delivered solid results with core earnings of $48 million, down approximately 8% from 2015, producing a core earnings margin of 5.5%. The main drivers to this decline, were lower net interest income and slightly higher losses, offset by lower expenses. The overall performance of our group life and disability book remains strong, and I'm pleased with our operating performance.
The modestly higher loss ratio is primarily due to a year-over-year volatility in claims and disability severity driven by slightly higher average wage on recent claims.
Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% in the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group of business continues to hold around 90.
Fully insured ongoing sales were $266 million for the quarter. This was our second highest sales quarter over the past 6 years, surpassed only by first quarter 2015, which was exceptionally strong.
In summary, we are well-positioned across Commercial Lines and Group Benefits to meet the challenges of increasingly competitive conditions. We're focused on retaining our accounts and maintaining margins. And in Personal Lines, we're aggressively addressing loss trends through numerous pricing and underwriting actions. Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management action before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual Fund core earnings were down $2 million from the first quarter of 2015, due to the impact of lower average AUM. Total AUM was down about the 6% from a year ago, consisting of a 3% decline in mutual fund AUM,  principally due to market level and a 17% decline in Talcott AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity.
While the performance from a solid with 56% of all funds and 68% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years. Net flows were negative $186 million as positive equity net flows were more than offset by negative flows in fixed income. Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $776 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined from $111 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $77 million, slightly below our outlook as limited partnership income was significantly below our 6% annualized return assumption.
Limited partnership return impacted all of our segments, which I will cover in more detail in the investment section.
Surrender activity was over the last year at 6.7% for variable annuities and 4.4% for fixed annuities. Annualized surrender rates in the first quarter of 2015 were at elevated levels 10.9% and 6.2%, respectively, as they included the impacts of several contract-holder initiative, all of which concluded in 2015.
Corporate reported a slightly better core loss of $51 million compared to a core loss of $62 million in the prior year. The primary driver was lower interest expense due to our debt capital management program. 
Turning to investments. Our before tax portfolio y excluding limited partnership was 4.1% this quarter, consistent with both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. Nonroutine investment income, such as payments on bond calls was minimal this quarter totaling $6 million before tax compared with $26 million in the first quarter of 2015.
The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership, declined to 3.8% from 4% in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower nonroutine investment income and a reinvestment rate over the last 12 months that was lower than the overall portfolio yield.
This quarter's yield improved slightly over the 3.7% achieved in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower investment expenses. Pretax investment income from limited partnerships was $8 million, or an annualized yield of 1% compared with $99 million or a 14% annualized yield in first quarter 2015.
While returns on limited partnerships are volatile, our average annualized return over the last 3 years was 9%, well in excess of our 6% planning assumption.
The decline in income this quarter is due to losses on hedge fund and lower income on real estate funds compared to the prior year, which benefited from gains on sales of underlying properties. Our hedge fund performance has generally been better than the global hedge fund index. However, hedge funds in general, have not performed well recently, and we have been reducing our allocation to them over time.
The credit profile of the investment portfolio remains strong. Total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges in the quarter were $23 million before tax compared with $42 million in the fourth quarter and $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. Energy-related credit impairments have increased in the past year as credit deterioration and downgrades continue in the sector. Our energy portfolio totaled $2.4 billion at March 31, 2016, down from $2.5 billion at year-end 2015, and $3.7 billion at year end 2014, a reduction of 36% over the past 5 quarters.
We sold about $200 million of energy exposure during the quarter resulting in net realized loss of about $30 million before tax. As energy prices have remained volatile, we continue to manage our exposure proactively with the preference to own higher quality credits that we believe can withstand a lower for longer price environment. To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings for diluted share were $0.95, down 9% from first quarter 2015, largely due to decrease in new partnership income and the results in personal auto.
The 12 months core earnings ROE was 8.8% in total and 10.3% excluding Talcott. The P&C core earnings ROE was 12.7% and Group Benefits was 10.2%. These are strong results given a difficult operating and capital markets environments over the past year.
Turning to shareholders' equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI rose 7% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation including dividends over the past 12 months of 8.7% versus our target of 9%. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $350 million, at an average price of $41.72 per share. During April 2017, we have repurchased $105 million, leaving $875 million remaining under the authorization.
As you know, we tend to be consistent in dwith our approach to repurchases and expect a use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, in 2016, we remained focused on maintaining margin in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, and working to improve performance in Personal Lines. Despite challenging capital markets, our investment portfolio continues to perform well and we are focused on effectively and efficiently managing the runoff of Talcott.
I will open the call over to so we can begin the Q&A session."

And maybe this is just a good moment for me to justify the frequency. I think its a a complicated measure, and I think it's important that we all understand exactly what we're saying. So let me just say this. For us, frequency does not solely equal just a number of accidents. Frequencies a function of the number of accidents and the number of coverage elements associated with the original collision. So for example, given an accident, we will receive an initial report essentially a physical damage or a collision claim. But as that claim develops, additional coverages may be involved such as medical, uninsured -- underinsured or uninsured or other BI elements. As a result, our method for frequency includes both the collision, but also the other coverages involved. And so what we saw in the first quarter, was a development on the BI side of our frequency for the second half of 2015. It was not a development of the number of collisions, but it was the BI associated, and we include that in our calculation when we share our ultimate frequency. And maybe one last clarifier, when we do share frequency trends, we're providing an estimate of the claim counts developed to for that accident period. Based on accident-related claim reported, we estimate how many more claims we expect to be reported for that accident period, and that becomes our frequency measure. So it's not a year intake across claims, its not some of the other things that may be others may be reporting, ours is our best shot at the ultimate frequency in the quarter. And what changed in Q1 for 2015, was the BI components of our collision claim second half of the year."

Couple of thoughts. 2014, our change in our reserve question clearly is driven by the injury movement that we have now seen. I'll start by saying that our early look on '14 through the 12 months, even early part of 2015, was very, very positive. In fact, I would say that, that year was running positive relative to the prior years. And then, things started to shift throughout 2015. And clearly, as we looked at that book of business the 90 days, we've seen pressure there. So we went back and adjusted '14. It might be a surprise for people to understand how much of our open injury claim book is still open unpaid as of 12/31/15. I'm talking about accident year '14 unpaid at 12/31. Between 40% and 50% of our BI claims are still open. That is the component that we're seeing more pressure to close. Those that are close are closing for greater dollars than we expected. And its costing us greater dollars to defend those cases as well. So what we saw through that loss component is what drove us to '14. And then you're right.

I'm generally pleased with our results this quarter, particularly in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, each of which delivered strong margins. We grew book value per share, excluding AOCI, 7% over the past year, and achieved a 10.3% core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott. We repurchased $350 million of shares during the quarter and plan to complete our buyback program by the end of 2016.
However, core earnings were down 15% over last year, as we continue to face some of the same headwinds from the second half of 2015. First, personal auto lost cost trends remain challenging, which impacted margins and led to strengthening reserves for the 2014 and 2015 accident years. Second, Commercial Lines performance has been very strong, with compensation continues to intensify making it more challenging to grow at acceptable returns. And third, consistent with capital market activity, limited partnership investment income remained low similar to the second half of 2015, with an annualized yield of only 1%.
This was a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015, where returns averaged 14%. Given these headwinds, I'm pleased with the continued progress we have made in most of our lines of business. Doug and Beth will go into further detail about first quarter performance. But I would like to touch upon a few highlights, both positive and negative. We generated strong margins in Commercial Lines supported by underwriting discipline across all of our businesses. All-in combined ratio improved 4.8 points due to lower catastrophes and higher favorable prior year development, while the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, improved 2.8 points to 89.6. Group Benefits remained strong with a core earnings after-tax margin of 5.5%, top line growth from good January sales performance and solid in-force persistency.
Although Mutual Funds' core earnings were down slightly, the business continues to deliver steady investment performance and had positive flows in equity funds. In February, Barron's recognized our 2015 investment performance, naming Hartford Funds as a top 10 fund family for the third time in the last 4 years.
While many of our businesses sustained their track record of underwriting improvement, Personal Lines results were disappointing overall. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, improved slightly to 89.7, but this was entirely attributable to the very strong homeowners results due to lower non-CAT weather and fire losses.
However, personal auto results deteriorated with a 1.6-point increase in the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development. Doug will talk about the underlying trends that contributed to these results, as well as the initiatives we have underway to improve profitability, including pricing action.
Given these trends and the time needed to implement responsive actions that earn in, we currently expect the 2016 Personal Lines combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, to be at or above the high end of the 90 to 92 outlook we provided in February. 
Turning from our financial results. We like to provide an update on a few recent investments in products and distribution to make us a broader and deeper risk player.
On March 16, we announced our agreement to acquire Maxum Specialty Insurance Group, a well-respected E&S insurer with an experienced management team and a strong underwriting culture. The addition of Maxum will further strengthen our market leadership in small commercial by extending our product capabilities, adding E&S talent and helping to improve the customer and agent experience. We are hard at work in our integration plans. Our management team recently spent time with Maxum employees, introducing them to the extended team and to the opportunities The Hartford will bring to their business. In terms of the transaction process, we filed our Form A with the Delaware regulator this month, and expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter. We are all eager to begin working together and to demonstrate the power of our joint capability once this deal closes.
We also announced the expansion of our international insurance placement capabilities for Commercial Lines customers. Our new alliance with AXA Corporate Solutions, enables us to offer U.S. customers coverage for their international exposures, with a primary focus on developed markets, such as Europe and Asia. The Hartford will maintain underwriting and pricing control of these policies and will assume a 100% of the risks through a reinsurance agreement with AXA.
Aside from these 2 projects, we're hard at work on other initiatives and investments to accelerate premium growth and improve our operating capabilities. I look forward to showing our progress with you in the future.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to comment on some of the changing dynamics in the P&C industry. Some carriers are retreating or refocusing their businesses due to poor underwriting results, while others are undergoing strategic and leadership changes. Technology-based disruption is accelerating, affecting all industry participants. At the same time, we see competition intensifying, continued low interest rates and loss cost challenges, such as in personal auto. We recognize these challenges posed by these dynamics, and I remain confident in our ability to navigate this more difficult environment, including the work we acquired in Personal Lines. The Hartford has a strong foundation and an experienced management team with the resolve to maintain underwriting discipline and expense control. We are reacting to these changes in the landscape and are focused on execution.
Now, I will turn the call over to Doug."

We started 2016 with strong results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, continuing our solid execution from 2015 and successfully adapting to a changing competitive landscape.
Results in Personal Lines were disappointing as we took reserve actions to address emerging auto liability loss cost trends. I will share more on Commercial Lines and Group Benefits in a moment, but first I would like to cover our results for Personal Lines.
Core earnings for Personal Lines were $23 million for the quarter, down from $75 million last year. Catastrophe losses were $22 million higher than in 2015, which was a particularly light CAT quarter for Personal Lines. First quarter of 2016 included several well-documented storms in Texas, where we have teams currently deployed to assist our customers. Also included in core earnings this quarter is $65 million pretax of adverse auto liability development, primarily related to accident years 2014 and 2015, partially offset by favorable development in property.
The adverse auto liability development for accident year 2014 resulted from bodily injury severity trends with losses emerging more slowly than we expected. As more claims from this accident year are reaching settlement, we've recognized that our previous reserve estimates were too optimistic. For accident year 2015, our auto liability booking reflects the higher severity estimates that carried forward from 2014, as well as increased frequency trends. Our revised estimate of ultimate frequency trend for the third and fourth quarter of 2015 is now approximately 1 to 2 points higher than we estimated at year-end, reflecting the continued reporting of bodily injury claims from those accident quarters. That puts our frequency call for the second half of 2015 in the mid-single-digit range.
The Personal Lines underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior period development and catastrophes, was 89.7, improving 0.2 from last year. Favorable non-catastrophe homeowner losses and a lower expense ratio, more than offset adverse auto losses. Frequency, which picked up in the second half of 2015, appears to be moderating somewhat in the current accident quarter at 2%. Severity on the other hand is notched up to 4%. Overall, we believe that our loss cost trends are consistent with recent quarters. However, as frequency and severity matures, our accident quarter estimates may change. As we continue to analyze the underlying trends and understand what is driving them, we nevertheless recognize that we need to take actions to address the profitability of our auto book. We're working aggressively on several fronts. First, our rate filings in the first quarter of 2016 were double the number from first quarter of last year, representing an average rate change in the applicable territories of 6.5%. The number of rate filings we've planned for the full year is 40% higher than in 2015, with an average increase in those territories of 6.6% in direct and 8.5% in agency. Given that we mainly issue 12-month policies, much of the 2016 filed rate change will earn into the book in 2017.
Second, in addition to addressing the underlying market trends with rate, we're taking other targeted actions to improve our profitability. In agency, we've terminated 2,200 unproductive relationships, deauthorized 2,300 agents from the AARP program and rolled out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. Agency written premium was down 8% in the quarter; however, AARP Agency was up 6%. We expect this shift in business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents to contribute to improve profitability over time.
On the direct side, we're targeting our marketing spend to more adequately priced customer segments and addressing underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. Our program with AARP remains the cornerstone of this business. We are confident that we have headroom for growth with the current membership base, and as we've seen over many years with this business, we will continue to deliver both strong customer value and profitability.
While Personal Lines clearly has challenges to address, I'm very pleased with our results in Commercial Lines, where we continue to prioritize retentions and margins over growth amid increasing competition. We delivered core earnings of $249 million with the combined ratio of 91.1. This was an earnings increase of $15 million from first quarter 2015 and a combined ratio improvement of 4.8 points. Lower property losses, favorable prior year development and improved workers' compensation margins were largely offset by a decline in net investment income of $37 million after tax. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $14 million less than in 2015. While first quarter catastrophe losses were above our expectations in both 2016 and 2015, this is typical volatility associated with storm activity.
Intense weather in the Southwest, particularly late in the quarter, has continued into April, and we are fully engaged to meet the needs of our customers. Renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to the fourth quarter of 2015. I'm very pleased with this outcome and our continued balance of retention, pricing and new business.
Loss trends in worker's compensation remain favorable and returns are within our target range. We released worker's compensation reserves across Commercial Lines, reacting to the favorable emerged frequency we've experienced in more recent accident years along with the continued benign severity trends. We had adverse development in general liability, including the GL component of the Small Commercial package business, often referred to as business owners policy, or BOP.
Within certain risk classes, we've seen an increase in claims with greater complexity and likelihood of litigation. Losses on these claims are tended to emerge more slowly, and we have revised our estimates accordingly.
Looking at Small Commercial. The business continues to perform extremely well. The strong margins posted again this quarter along with the continued top line growth, reflect the momentum we've generated in this key market segment for us. The underlying combined ratio was 86.7, 2.9 points better than last year. The improvement was driven mainly by favorable non-catastrophe property losses and a modest improvement in worker's compensation results. Written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention and solid new business flow, even as competitive conditions intensified. New business of $146 million was up 4% from 2015.
Moving over to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 92, improving 1.7 points from first quarter 2015. Improvement is largely driven by favorable non-catastrophes property losses and continued margin improvement in worker's compensation. Written premium declined 4% in the quarter. We're pleased with our retentions and ability to maintain solid pricing levels. However, new business was down $21 million versus last year. Our submission flow was off 7% this quarter versus a year ago as well as more accounts falling outside our underwriting and rate adequacy thresholds. I suspect that higher retentions across our competitors, coupled with our targeted underwriting message, are driving this result.
We expect moderated new business levels over the next few quarters as we balance growth aspirations with our objective to maintain the improved profitability that we worked hard to achieve.
Within Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 94.3, improved 4.8 points versus prior year, reflecting particularly strong margin improvement in National Accounts and Financial Products. Favorable prior year development in Financial Products contributed to Specialty Commercial's combined ratio of 76.5. This is based on our continued favorable experience in D&O. National Accounts continues to perform well under market conditions very similar to Middle Market. Competition is intense, but we're comfortable with our retentions and the new business accounts we're winning.
Finally, circling back to Group Benefits, we delivered solid results with core earnings of $48 million, down approximately 8% from 2015, producing a core earnings margin of 5.5%. The main drivers to the decline were lower net investment income and slightly higher losses, offset by lower expenses. The overall performance of our group life and disability book remains strong, and I'm pleased with our operating performance.
The modestly higher loss ratio is primarily due to year-over-year volatility in AD&D claims and disability severity driven by slightly higher average wage on recent claims.
Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group lock of business continues to hold around 90.
Fully insured ongoing sales were $266 million for the quarter. This was our second highest sales quarter over the past 6 years, surpassed only by first quarter 2015, which was exceptionally strong.
In summary, we are well-positioned across Commercial Lines and Group Benefits to meet the challenges of increasingly competitive conditions. We're focused on retaining our accounts and maintaining margins. And in Personal Lines, we're aggressively addressing loss trends through numerous pricing and underwriting actions. Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management actions before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual Funds' core earnings were down $2 million from the first quarter of 2015, due to the impact of lower average AUM. Total AUM was down about 6% from a year ago, consisting of a 3% decline in mutual fund AUM, principally due to market levels, and a 17% decline in Talcott AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity.
Fund performance remained solid with 56% of all funds and 68% of equity funds, outperforming peers over the last 5 years. Net flows were negative $186 million as positive equity net flows were more than offset by negative flows in fixed income. Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $776 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined from $111 million in the first quarter of 2015 to $77 million, slightly below our outlook as limited partnership income was significantly below our 6% annualized return assumption.
Limited partnership returns impacted all of our segments, which I will cover in more detail in the investment section.
Surrender activity was lower than last year at 6.7% for variable annuities and 4.4% for fixed annuities. Annualized surrender rates in the first quarter of 2015 were at elevated levels of 10.9% and 6.2%, respectively, as they included the impacts of several contract holder initiatives, all of which concluded in 2015.
Corporate reported a slightly better core loss of $51 million compared to a core loss of $62 million in the prior year. The primary driver was lower interest expense due to our debt capital management program. 
Turning to investments. Our before-tax portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.1% this quarter, consistent with both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. Non-routine investment income, such as make-whole payments on bond calls, was minimal this quarter, totaling $6 million before tax compared with $26 million in the first quarter of 2015.
The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, declined to 3.8% from 4% in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower non-routine investment income and a reinvestment rate over the last 12 months that was lower than the overall portfolio yield.
This quarter's yield improved slightly over the 3.7% achieved in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower investment expenses. Pretax investment income from limited partnerships was $8 million or an annualized yield of 1% compared with $99 million or a 14% annualized yield in first quarter 2015.
While returns on limited partnerships are volatile, our average annualized return over the last 3 years was 9%, well in excess of our 6% planning assumption.
The decline in income this quarter is due to losses on hedge funds and lower income on real estate funds compared to the prior year, which benefited from gains on sales of underlying properties. Our hedge fund performance has generally been better than the global hedge fund index. However, hedge funds, in general, have not performed well recently, and we have been reducing our allocation to them over time.
The credit profile of the investment portfolio remains strong. Total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges in the quarter were $23 million before tax compared with $42 million in the fourth quarter and $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. Energy-related credit impairments have increased in the past year, as credit deterioration and downgrades continue in the sector. Our energy portfolio totaled $2.4 billion at March 31, 2016, down from $2.5 billion at year-end 2015, and $3.7 billion at year-end 2014, a reduction of 36% over the past 5 quarters.
We sold about $200 million of energy exposure during the quarter, resulting in a net realized loss of about $30 million before tax. As energy prices have remained volatile, we continue to manage our exposure proactively with the preference to own higher quality credits that we believe can withstand a lower for longer price environment. To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.95, down 9% from first quarter 2015, largely due to decrease in new partnership income and the results in personal auto.
The 12 months core earnings ROE was 8.8% in total and 10.3%, excluding Talcott. The P&C core earnings ROE was 12.7% and Group Benefits was 10.2%. These are strong results given the difficult operating and capital markets environments over the past year.
Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 7% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends, over the past 12 months of 8.7% versus our target of 9%. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $350 million, at an average price of $41.72 per share. During April, through the 27th, we have repurchased 105 million, leaving 875 million remaining under the authorization.
As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, in 2016, we remained focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, and working to improve performance in Personal Lines. Despite challenging capital markets, our investment portfolio continues to perform well, and we are focused on effectively and efficiently managing the runoff of Talcott.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

And maybe this is just a good moment for me justify to define the frequency because I think it's a complicated measure, and I think it's important that we all understand exactly what we're saying. So let me just say this. For us, frequency does not solely equal just a number of accidents. Frequency is a function of the number of accidents and the number of coverage elements associated with the original collision. So for example, given an accident, we will receive an initial report, essentially a physical damage or a collision claim. But as that claim develops, additional coverages may be involved, such as medical uninsured -- underinsured or uninsured or other BI elements. As a result, our method for calculating frequency includes both the collision, but also the other coverages involved. And so what we saw in the first quarter was a development on the BI side of our frequency for the second half of 2015. It was not a development of the number of collisions, but it was the BI associated, and we include that in our calculation when we share our ultimate pics of frequency. And maybe one last clarifier. When we do share frequency trends, we're providing an estimate of the claim counts developed to ultimate for the accident period. Based on accidents related claim reported, we estimate how many more claims we expect to be reported for that accident period, and that becomes our frequency measure. So it's not a count year intake across claims, its not some of the other things that may be others, may be reporting, ours is our best shot at the ultimate frequency in the quarter. And what changed in Q1 for 2015 was the BI components of our collision claim second half of the year."

I'd start by saying that our early look on '14 through the first 12 months, even in the early part of 2015, was very, very positive. In fact, I would say that, that year was running extremely positive relative to the prior years. And then, things started to shift throughout 2015. And clearly, as we looked at that book of business the last 90 days, we've seen pressure there. So we went back and adjusted '14. It might be a surprise for people to understand how much of our open bodily injury claim book is still open unpaid as of 12/31/15. I'm talking about accident year '14 unpaid at 12/31. Between 40% and 50% of our BI claims are still open. That is the component that we're seeing more pressure to close. Those that are closing are closing for greater dollars than we expected. And its costing us greater dollars to defend those cases as well. So what we saw through that loss component is what drove us to '14. And then you're right.

That appears to have settled down, and our numbers in first quarter were reasonably quite, flattish. And I would add, and as we shared with you last year, that's off of a tough compare. So we feel pretty good about collision accidents in the first quarter. Keep in mind, weather was relatively tame. So have to understand that as well. On the liability frequency, we are seeing more features, more BI components to the collisions that are being reported, and we're addressing them. So in 2015, the uptick in frequency was both more features, more coverages attached to those collisions. And that is rolling into '16 relative to our expectations. So we've reset baseline, if you will, for '16. We have built in our pricing programs, what we think are kind of new norms for severity and frequency.

I'm generally pleased with our results this quarter, particularly in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, each of which delivered strong margins. We grew book value per share, excluding AOCI, 7% over the past year, and achieved a 10.3% core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott. We repurchased $350 million of shares during the quarter and plan to complete our buyback program by the end of 2016.
However, core earnings were down 15% over last year, as we continue to face some of the same headwinds from the second half of 2015. First, personal auto lost cost trends remain challenging, which impacted margins and led to strengthening reserves for the 2014 and 2015 accident years. Second, Commercial Lines performance has been very strong, but competition continues to intensify making it more challenging to grow at acceptable returns. And third, consistent with capital market activity, limited partnership investment income remained low similar to the second half of 2015, with an annualized yield of only 1%.
This was a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015, where returns averaged 14%. Given these headwinds, I'm pleased with the continued progress we have made in most of our lines of business. Doug and Beth will go into further detail about first quarter performance. But I would like to touch upon a few highlights, both positive and negative. We generated strong margins in Commercial Lines supported by underwriting discipline across all of our businesses. All-in combined ratio improved 4.8 points due to lower catastrophes and higher favorable prior year development, while the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, improved 2.8 points to 89.6. Group Benefits remained strong with a core earnings after-tax margin of 5.5%, top line growth from good January sales performance and solid in-force book persistency.
Although Mutual Funds' core earnings were down slightly, the business continues to deliver steady investment performance and had positive flows in equity funds. In February, Barron's recognized our 2015 investment performance, naming Hartford Funds as a top 10 fund family for the third time in the last 4 years.
While many of our businesses sustained their track record of underwriting improvement, Personal Lines results were disappointing overall. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, improved slightly to 89.7, but this was entirely attributable to the very strong homeowners results due to lower non-CAT weather and fire losses.
However, personal auto results deteriorated with a 1.6-point increase in the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development. Doug will talk about the underlying trends that contributed to these results, as well as the initiatives we have underway to improve profitability, including pricing actions.
Given these trends and the time needed to implement responsive actions that earn in, we currently expect the 2016 Personal Lines combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, to be at or above the high end of the 90 to 92 outlook we provided in February. 
Turning from our financial results. We like to provide an update on a few recent investments in products and distribution to make us a broader and deeper risk player.
On March 16, we announced our agreement to acquire Maxum Specialty Insurance Group, a well-respected E&S insurer with an experienced management team and a strong underwriting culture. The addition of Maxum will further strengthen our market leadership in small commercial by extending our product capabilities, adding E&S talent and helping to improve the customer and agent experience. We are hard at work in our integration plans. Our management team recently spent time with Maxum employees, introducing them to the extended team and to the opportunities The Hartford will bring to their business. In terms of the transaction process, we filed our Form A with the Delaware regulator this month, and expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter. We are all eager to begin working together and to demonstrate the power of our joint capability once this deal closes.
We also announced the expansion of our international insurance placement capabilities for Commercial Lines customers. Our new alliance with AXA Corporate Solutions, enables us to offer U.S. customers coverage for their international exposures, with a primary focus on developed markets, such as Europe and Asia. The Hartford will maintain underwriting and pricing control of these policies and will assume a 100% of the risks through a reinsurance agreement with AXA.
Aside from these 2 projects, we're hard at work on other initiatives and investments to accelerate premium growth and improve our operating capabilities. I look forward to showing our progress with you in the future.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to comment on some of the changing dynamics in the P&C industry. Some carriers are retreating or refocusing their businesses due to poor underwriting results, while others are undergoing strategic and leadership changes. Technology-based disruption is accelerating, affecting all industry participants. At the same time, we see competition intensifying, continued low interest rates and loss cost challenges, such as in personal auto. We recognize these challenges posed by these dynamics, and I remain confident in our ability to navigate this more difficult environment, including the work required in Personal Lines. The Hartford has a strong foundation and an experienced management team with the resolve to maintain underwriting discipline and expense control. We are reacting to these changes in the landscape and are focused on execution.
Now, I will turn the call over to Doug."

We started 2016 with strong results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, continuing our solid execution from 2015 and successfully adapting to a changing competitive landscape.
Results in Personal Lines were disappointing as we took reserve actions to address emerging auto liability loss cost trends. I will share more on Commercial Lines and Group Benefits in a moment, but first I would like to cover our results for Personal Lines.
Core earnings for Personal Lines were $23 million for the quarter, down from $75 million last year. Catastrophe losses were $22 million higher than in 2015, which was a particularly light CAT quarter for Personal Lines. First quarter of 2016 included several well-documented storms in Texas, where we have teams currently deployed to assist our customers. Also included in core earnings this quarter is $65 million pretax of adverse auto liability development, primarily related to accident years 2014 and 2015, partially offset by favorable development in property.
The adverse auto liability development for accident year 2014 resulted from bodily injury severity trends with losses emerging more slowly than we expected. As more claims from this accident year are reaching settlement, we've recognized that our previous reserve estimates were too optimistic. For accident year 2015, our auto liability booking reflects the higher severity estimates that carried forward from 2014, as well as increased frequency trends. Our revised estimate of ultimate frequency trend for the third and fourth quarter of 2015 is now approximately 1 to 2 points higher than we estimated at year-end, reflecting the continued reporting of bodily injury claims from those accident quarters. That puts our frequency call for the second half of 2015 in the mid-single-digit range.
The Personal Lines underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior period development and catastrophes, was 89.7, improving 0.2 of a point from last year. Favorable non-catastrophe homeowner losses and a lower expense ratio, more than offset adverse auto losses. Frequency, which picked up in the second half of 2015, appears to be moderating somewhat in the current accident quarter at 2%. Severity on the other hand is notched up to 4%. Overall, we believe that our loss cost trends are consistent with recent quarters. However, as frequency and severity matures, our accident quarter estimates may change. As we continue to analyze the underlying trends and understand what is driving them, we nevertheless recognize that we need to take actions to address the profitability of our auto book. We're working aggressively on several fronts. First, our rate filings in the first quarter of 2016 were double the number from first quarter of last year, representing an average rate change in the applicable territories of 6.5%. The number of rate filings we've planned for the full year is 40% higher than in 2015, with an average increase in those territories of 6.6% in direct and 8.5% in agency. Given that we mainly issue 12-month policies, much of the 2016 filed rate change will earn into the book in 2017.
Second, in addition to addressing the underlying market trends with rate, we're taking other targeted actions to improve our profitability. In agency, we've terminated 2,200 unproductive relationships, deauthorized 2,300 agents from the AARP program and rolled out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. Agency written premium was down 8% in the quarter; however, AARP Agency was up 6%. We expect this shift in business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents to contribute to improve profitability over time.
On the direct side, we're targeting our marketing spend to more adequately priced customer segments and addressing underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. Our program with AARP remains the cornerstone of this business. We are confident that we have headroom for growth with the current membership base, and as we've seen over many years with this business, we will continue to deliver both strong customer value and profitability.
While Personal Lines clearly has challenges to address, I'm very pleased with our results in Commercial Lines, where we continue to prioritize retentions and margins over growth amid increasing competition. We delivered core earnings of $249 million with a combined ratio of 91.1. This was an earnings increase of $15 million from first quarter 2015 and a combined ratio improvement of 4.8 points. Lower property losses, favorable prior year development and improved workers' compensation margins were largely offset by a decline in net investment income of $37 million after tax. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $14 million less than in 2015. While first quarter catastrophe losses were above our expectations in both 2016 and 2015, this is typical volatility associated with storm activity.
Intense weather in the Southwest, particularly late in the quarter, has continued into April, and we are fully engaged to meet the needs of our customers. Renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to the fourth quarter of 2015. I'm very pleased with this outcome and our continued balance of retention, pricing and new business.
Loss trends in workers' compensation remain favorable and returns are within our target range. We released workers' compensation reserves across Commercial Lines, reacting to the favorable emerged frequency we've experienced in more recent accident years along with the continued benign severity trends. We had adverse development in general liability, including the GL component of the Small Commercial package business, often referred to as business owners policy, or BOP.
Within certain risk classes, we've seen an increase in claims with greater complexity and likelihood of litigation. Losses on these claims have tended to emerge more slowly, and we have revised our estimates accordingly.
Looking at Small Commercial. The business continues to perform extremely well. The strong margins posted again this quarter along with the continued top line growth, reflect the momentum we've generated in this key market segment for us. The underlying combined ratio was 86.7, 2.9 points better than last year. The improvement was driven mainly by favorable non-catastrophe property losses and a modest improvement in workers' compensation results. Written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention and solid new business flow, even as competitive conditions intensified. New business of $146 million was up 4% from 2015.
Moving over to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 92, improving 1.7 points from first quarter 2015. The improvement is largely driven by favorable non-catastrophes property losses and continued margin improvement in workers' compensation. Written premium declined 4% in the quarter. We're pleased with our retentions and ability to maintain solid pricing levels. However, new business was down $21 million versus last year. Our submission flow was off 7% this quarter versus a year ago as well as more accounts falling outside our underwriting and rate adequacy thresholds. I suspect that higher retentions across our competitors, coupled with our targeted underwriting message, are driving this result.
We expect moderated new business levels over the next few quarters as we balance growth aspirations with our objective to maintain the improved profitability that we've worked hard to achieve.
Within Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 94.3, improved 4.8 points versus prior year, reflecting particularly strong margin improvement in National Accounts and Financial Products. Favorable prior year development in Financial Products contributed to Specialty Commercial's combined ratio of 76.5. This is based on our continued favorable experience in D&O. National Accounts continues to perform well under market conditions very similar to Middle Market. Competition is intense, but we're comfortable with our retentions and the new business accounts we're winning.
Finally, circling back to Group Benefits, we delivered solid results with core earnings of $48 million, down approximately 8% from 2015, producing a core earnings margin of 5.5%. The main drivers to the decline were lower net investment income and slightly higher losses, offset by lower expenses. The overall performance of our group life and disability book remains strong, and I'm pleased with our operating performance.
The modestly higher loss ratio is primarily due to year-over-year volatility in AD&D claims and disability severity driven by slightly higher average wage on recent claims.
Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90.
Fully insured ongoing sales were $266 million for the quarter. This was our second highest sales quarter over the past 6 years, surpassed only by first quarter 2015, which was exceptionally strong.
In summary, we are well-positioned across Commercial Lines and Group Benefits to meet the challenges of increasingly competitive conditions. We're focused on retaining our accounts and maintaining margins. And in Personal Lines, we're aggressively addressing loss trends through numerous pricing and underwriting actions. Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management actions before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual Funds' core earnings were down $2 million from the first quarter of 2015, due to the imp",898,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management actions before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual Funds' core earnings were down $2 million from the first quarter of 2015, due to the impact of lower average AUM. Total AUM was down about 6% from a year ago, consisting of a 3% decline in mutual fund AUM, principally due to market levels, and a 17% decline in Talcott AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity.
Fund performance remained solid with 56% of all funds and 68% of equity funds, outperforming peers over the last 5 years. Net flows were a negative $186 million as positive equity net flows were more than offset by negative flows in fixed income. Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $776 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined from $111 million in the first quarter of 2015 to $77 million, slightly below our outlook as limited partnership income was significantly below our 6% annualized return assumption.
Limited partnership returns impacted all of our segments, which I will cover in more detail in the investment section.
Surrender activity was lower than last year at 6.7% for variable annuities and 4.4% for fixed annuities. Annualized surrender rates in the first quarter of 2015 were at elevated levels of 10.9% and 6.2%, respectively, as they included the impacts of several contract holder initiatives, all of which concluded in 2015.
Corporate reported a slightly better core loss of $51 million compared to a core loss of $62 million in the prior year. The primary driver was lower interest expense due to our debt capital management program. 
Turning to investments. Our before-tax portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.1% this quarter, consistent with both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. Non-routine investment income, such as make-whole payments on bond calls, was minimal this quarter, totaling $6 million before tax compared with $26 million in the first quarter of 2015.
The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, declined to 3.8% from 4% in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower non-routine investment income and a reinvestment rate over the last 12 months that was lower than the overall portfolio yield.
This quarter's yield improved slightly over the 3.7% achieved in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower investment expenses. Pretax investment income from limited partnerships was $8 million or an annualized yield of 1% compared with $99 million or a 14% annualized yield in first quarter 2015.
While returns on limited partnerships are volatile, our average annualized return over the last 3 years was 9%, well in excess of our 6% planning assumption.
The decline in income this quarter is due to losses on hedge funds and lower income on real estate funds compared to the prior year, which benefited from gains on sales of underlying properties. Our hedge fund performance has generally been better than the global hedge fund index. However, hedge funds, in general, have not performed well recently, and we have been reducing our allocation to them over time.
The credit profile of the investment portfolio remains strong. Total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges in the quarter were $23 million before tax compared with $42 million in the fourth quarter and $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. Energy-related credit impairments have increased in the past year, as credit deterioration and downgrades continue in the sector. Our energy portfolio totaled $2.4 billion at March 31, 2016, down from $2.5 billion at year-end 2015, and $3.7 billion at year-end 2014, a reduction of 36% over the past 5 quarters.
We sold about $200 million of energy exposure during the quarter, resulting in a net realized loss of about $30 million before tax. As energy prices have remained volatile, we continue to manage our exposure proactively with the preference to own higher quality credits that we believe can withstand a lower for longer price environment. To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.95, down 9% from first quarter 2015, largely due to decrease in new partnership income and the results in personal auto.
The 12 months core earnings ROE was 8.8% in total and 10.3%, excluding Talcott. The P&C core earnings ROE was 12.7% and Group Benefits was 10.2%. These are strong results given the difficult operating and capital markets environments over the past year.
Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 7% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends, over the past 12 months of 8.7% versus our target of 9%. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $350 million, at an average price of $41.72 per share. During April, through the 27th, we have repurchased 105 million, leaving 875 million remaining under the authorization.
As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, in 2016, we remain focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, and working to improve performance in Personal Lines. Despite challenging capital markets, our investment portfolio continues to perform well, and we are focused on effectively and efficiently managing the runoff of Talcott.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

And maybe this is just a good moment for me just to define the frequency because I think it's a complicated measure, and I think it's important that we all understand exactly what we're saying. So let me just say this. For us, frequency does not solely equal just a number of accidents. Frequency is a function of the number of accidents and the number of coverage elements associated with the original collision. So for example, given an accident, we will receive an initial report, essentially a physical damage or a collision claim. But as that claim develops, additional coverages may be involved, such as medical uninsured -- underinsured or uninsured or other BI elements. As a result, our method for calculating frequency includes both the collision, but also the other coverages involved. And so what we saw in the first quarter was a development on the BI side of our frequency for the second half of 2015. It was not a development of the number of collisions, but it was the BI associated, and we include that in our calculation when we share our ultimate pics for frequency. And maybe one last clarifier. When we do share frequency trends, we're providing an estimate of the claim counts developed to ultimate for that accident period. Based on accidents related claim reported, we estimate how many more claims we expect to be reported for that accident period, and that becomes our frequency measure. So it's not a calendar year intake across claims, it's not some of the other things that may be others, may be reporting, ours is our best shot at the ultimate frequency in the quarter. And what changed in Q1 for 2015 was the BI components of our collision claim second half of the year."

Between 40% and 50% of our BI claims are still open. That is the component that we're seeing more pressure to close. Those that are closing are closing for greater dollars than we expected.

I expect our comp experience to continue going forward. Based on all of what we can see inside our current signals, that to me looks repeatable as we move forward. The property had a very good quarter. I'm hoping for better quarters. I know we're taking better underwriting actions, but I can't counter all that property going forward. So I think there's a -- maybe a 1/3 to 1/2 of that, that is repeatable. And I hope we can repeat the property as well."

On the liability frequency, we are seeing more features, more BI components to the collisions that are being reported, and we're addressing them.

From a bottom-line perspective, second quarter results were disappointing. Higher prior year development, including A&E, lower current accident year personal auto results, lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses led to a decline in our core earnings. 
However, I am pleased that our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses continued to generate solid underwriting results. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 5% over the prior year and 2% since year end. You all are aware of the challenges our industry is facing due to greater Commercial Lines competition, unfavorable auto loss cost trends and significantly lower interest rates. 
In Commercial Lines, competition is becoming more aggressive, especially in national accounts and middle market. Some companies are expanding into new markets, while other long-standing competitors are now willing to accept lower pricing or weaker terms and conditions. Renewable rate increases are hovering near short-term loss cost trends in most lines, so expanding margins from here will be difficult. 
While we've continued to deliver good Commercial Lines results by focusing on underwriting discipline, retention and maintaining underlining margins, we see fewer opportunities to grow the top line in middle and larger account markets over the next several quarters. We will continue to pick our spots prudently.
In Personal Lines, increased vehicle miles-driven as well as distracted driving have continued to put pressure on auto loss cost trends. Based in our analysis of the determination in frequency and severity, we strengthen resource for accident year 2015 and increased our lost ratio estimate for accident year 2016. 
In hindsight, I'm disappointed we didn't recognize earlier the magnitude of the changing trends. Doug will update you on the pricing, underwriting and agency management actions we are taking to get margins back to our target. 
Personal Lines is a core business for us, and our 30-plus year relationship with ARP provides a solid foundation for long-term growth opportunities. However, it will take time to fully restore profitability to target levels, I'm confident we will begin to see improved margins in this book in early 2017.
Another issue confronting our industry is the macroeconomic environment, especially the decline in interest rates, in part, due to Brexit. As it relates to Brexit, I'm confident at the global insurance markets, which have been managing insurance work freely across borders for centuries will make the necessary changes to adapt.
In the meantime, sustained low rates will continue to put pressure on net investment income and place greater emphasis on underwriting results. Our investment team has carefully steered our portfolio through many challenges over the past few years, including the European debt crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We will remain vigilant on the evolving macroeconomic environment and emerging risk.
I'd also highlight our strong risk management capabilities as our hedge programs have performed as expected in this period of heightened market volatility. 
During the quarter, we maintained our pace of capital return to shareholders with over $430 million of share repurchases and common dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned significant capital from Talcott  resolution to the holding company, which Beth will discuss. We expect to complete our current capital management plan of 4.4 billion of common equity repurchases by the end of 2016. 
Later this year, we will finalize our plans for 2017.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to note that based on first half results, we now expect the 2016 Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the 93 to 94 range. This reflects favorable homeowners results year-to-date, but an approximate 5-point deterioration in the auto underlying combined ratio compared to our original outlook.
That said, I'm confident in our approach to the current market conditions. We are taking the right steps to restore personal auto profitability, and we have the discipline to navigate the competitive Commercial Lines and Group Benefits environments. We will continue to build upon our strong franchise and invest for the future, including opportunities like the acquisition of Maxim, which is expected to close today. We will improve our operating capability and maximize efficiency, while redeploying excess capital to support long-term shareholder value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits post a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified.

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits post a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified. 
In Personal Lines, results were disappointing as loss trends in accident year 2015 continue to emerge adversely to our expectations, driving having both unfavorable prior development and a deterioration in our estimates for accident year 2016. 
Let me get right into Personal Lines, which posted a core loss of $55 million for the quarter, down from core earnings of $42 million last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 94.2, increasing 5.1 points versus last year. This was primarily due to higher auto liability loss cost, which I will discuss in a minute, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. 
Homeowners performance continues to be excellent. We experienced a slight uptick in fire-related losses, but this is compared to a very favorable second quarter 2015. 
CAT losses in the quarter were $104 million, $7 million higher than second quarter 2015, but generally in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the trends of our homeowners book.
Included in the Personal Lines underwriting loss this quarter is $75 million pretax of adverse auto liability development, primarily related to accident year 2015. The factors behind this adverse development remained consistent with those we described in the first quarter, which are related to higher employment, resulting in more people on the road. As a consequence, we're seeing both increased frequency and severity of bodily injury claims, which generally have the longest reporting lag and highest severity. 
Despite our first quarter reserve action, losses from the 2015 accident year emerged well above our previous expectations during the second quarter.
Due to the deterioration in these trends for the 2015 accident year, we also raised our 2016 accident year auto liability loss estimates, essentially carrying forward the 2015 experience. Based on our latest call, we do not expect to achieve the full year Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92 that we provided in February. 
This included homeowners of 77 to 79 and auto at 96 to 98. As I noted earlier, homeowners results have been strong, coming in favorable to our expectations. Auto on the other hand is running approximately 5 points adverse to our full year expectations. We now expect the Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 93 to 94. This incorporates our view that the rate of change in auto frequency will moderate for the second half of this year based on the elevated levels that began in the second half of 2015, and that the rate of change in auto severity will continue to hover in the low single-digit range. 
The actions we described last quarter to address the adverse auto liability trends are intensifying. These include a substantial increase in the number of rate filings versus prior year; aggressive nonrate actions to improve our profitability, such as terminating unproductive agency relationships, deauthorizing certain agents from the ARP program, enrolling out a new compensation structure focused on key partners agents. On the direct site, our marketing efforts are targeted toward preferred customer segments, and we continue to address underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. 
Our 2016 rate actions continued to accelerate, equating to over 200 million of premium on the auto line. The earned premium impact of this rate will follow and, ultimately, is based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in 2017.
As a result of our profit improvement steps, AARP Direct and AARP Agency written premium was up only modestly at 1% and 3%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Other agency was down 17%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix towards ARP members and our more highly partnered agents. 
When I step back and reflect on the first quarter of 2016 for Personal Lines, there's no hiding our disappointment in the results. However, encouraging signs are emerging from our various auto initiatives, and I'm confident that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Now let's shift over to commercial lines where we had a solid quarter with core earnings of 224 million, down 40 million from second quarter 2015. The combined ratio was 95, an increase of 2.8 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher CAT losses and lower current accident year margins in Small Commercial and middle market, offset by improved margins in Specialty. 
Renewal written pricing and Standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to first quarter 2016. 
In Small Commercial, we had another excellent quarter with strong retentions and margins. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9 was 1.8 points higher than last year. The increase is largely due to lower margins on package business, resulting from higher non-catastrophe property and general liability losses, offset by modest improvement in workers' compensation margins. Recall that property losses were very low a year ago, making this quarter a tough comparison. 
Small Commercial written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention, while new business was up 1% as competitive conditions intensified. We continue to advance our capabilities with initiatives and distribution, product, digital technology and analytics, all of which are crucial in the small commercial market and are helping us maintain our leadership position despite the increasing competition. 
Moving to middle market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 91.9, up 2.6 points from second quarter 2015. This was primarily due to less favorable property losses and an increase in expenses. 
Similar to Small Commercial, second quarter 2015 benefited from particularly favorable property losses.
Middle Market written premium in the quarter was flat compared to prior year. New business up 124 million increased 5 million over last year, due mainly to solid performance in our industry verticals, which we have been building in recent years as part of our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player. In other areas of Middle Market, we experienced a slight decline in both retention and new business for the quarter. This is a result of our disciplined pricing and underwriting stance in the market with our primary objectives centered on maintaining profitability.
Specialty Commercial had a very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4 improved 3.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins in National Accounts and the continued favorable margins in bond and financial products. 
Specialty Commercial premium was down 2% compared to second quarter '15, reflecting the competitive environment in National Accounts. I'm very pleased with how we're navigating these markets and the pricing discipline we continue to exhibit. 
I've described the marketplace for both Middle Market and National Accounts as increasingly aggressive, particularly for new business. We're seeing relative newcomers, some reemerging encumbrance as well as traditional players offering very competitive pricing. Although we continue to win new business and renew existing accounts and pricing that's both competitive and profitable, we expect that achieving total written premium growth in the near term will be challenging. 
Moving on to Group Benefits. Although core earnings down from last year, the business continues to perform well and is operating from a strong market position with solid returns. Second quarter 2016 core earnings of $46 million was down $10 million, producing a core earnings margin of 5.1%. The decline in core earnings was driven primarily by lower net investment income and higher group life mortality claims. 
The group life loss ratio increased 1.9 points to 78.1 for second quarter 2016. This was primarily due to higher claim severity, which can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. 
Mortality trends remain in line with our expectations.
On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. 
Fully insured ongoing sales were 80 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over second quarter 2015. We feel competitor pressures in this business too, particularly in long-term disability but had strong sales this quarter due to a large new account.
In summary, our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses are operating effectively in competitive market conditions, and we remain focused on business retention and margins. Consistent with our philosophy across the enterprise, we are diligently pricing and underwriting, prepared to pass on business that does not meet our return thresholds. 
In Personal Lines, we have hit a difficult stretch, but are taking numerous actions to address elevated loss cost and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. 
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. 
This quarter, in P&C and other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study. As a result of this study, we added $197 million before taxes asbestos reserve and $71 million before tax to environmental reserve. The increase in the asbestos reserves was due to mesothelioma claims not decreasing as expected over the past year for a small subset of peripheral defendants in adverse jurisdictions. The environmental charge reflects higher claim severity, including for additional property standard during resettlement discussion and increased legal defense and cleanup costs. 
After-tax, the A&E development increased 40 million from second quarter 2015, resulting in core losses for the segment of 154 million compared with 113 million in second quarter 2015. We are disappointed with the development on this book. And as we have said before, we continue to evaluate options for these closures, taking into account factors, such as the value we add by managing these claims ourselves, the loss of investment encumbers of the cost of the transaction as well as whether it is a permanent or partial transfer of risk. 
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a definitive agreement to sell our U.K. run-off P&C book to Catalina. This agreement provides for a permanent transfer of these liabilities and is not expected to have a material impact on our financials. 
Mutual Funds core earnings were down $2 million from second quarter 2015 due to lower fees as a result of lower assets under management. Total AUM was down about 4% from a year ago, consisting of a 2% decline in Mutual Fund AUM, principally due to lower market values over the past 12 months and a 15% decline in Talcott variable annuity AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. 
Funds performance remains solid with 62% of all funds and 70% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years.
Mutual Fund net flows were negative 419 million as positive net flows in multi-strategy investments were more than offset by negative flows in equities and fixed income. 
Over the last 12 months, that flows were positive 107 million.
Talcotts' core earnings declined to $91 million from $171 million in second quarter of 2015, which included a $48 million tax benefit in higher limited partnership income. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2016, full surrender activity increased slightly to 7.7% for variable annuities and to 5.1% for fixed annuity. 
Surrender activity in the quarter reflects normal run-off and there are no current contract folder initiative. VA surrender activity decreased from second quarter 2015, reflecting the ages of block and is largely consistent with our assumptions. 
We recently received approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance for the $250 million extraordinary dividend that we had expected from Talcott in the second half of 2016, and this amount was received by the holding company in July.
Combined with the $500 million we received in January, Talcott has provided $750 million of capital to the holding company during 2016 as planned. We continue to evaluate Talcott's capital generation outlook for 2016, which has been negatively impacted by lower interest rates. 
As you may recall, we had a 2016 outlook for $200 million to $300 million of capital generation, which was dependent on the market and the run-off of the book, among other things. Compared to the beginning of the year, equity markets remain high, which supports the income and earnings. However, as interest rates remain at current levels, we would most likely to record additional cash flow testing reserve at year-end, which would reduce or Aristocort eliminate 2016 capital generation at Talcott. 
While we have a ways to go until year end and a lot of things can change, this will be a factor for us to consider as we determine dividends for Talcott in 2017. 
I want to emphasize that even at current interest rates, Talcott's base case capital markets remains very strong and its stressed scenario capital margin, while lower than what we calculated in February, is still above our minimum. In short, the low interest rate averment has not changed Talcott's ability to remain capital self-sufficient in a stressed scenario.
Turning to investment. Our limited partnership returns total $40 million in the second quarter, which is in line with our 6% annualized outlook. All 3 asset classes had positive returns this quarter as contrasted with first quarter 2016 losses and hedged funds in real estate. However, compared with second quarter 2015, limited partnership income was down 57% year-over-year. In second quarter last year, we had a Specialty strong returns in real estate and private equity, resulting in a very difficult comparison.
Excluding limited partnerships, our before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, relatively consistent with the last year. However, we expect the portfolio yield and net investment income to decrease as new money yields remain below the book yield.
While our current projections for full year P&C net investment income, excluding partnerships, is still in line with our original outlook, the P&C portfolio yield exiting limited partnership declined this quarter to 3.8% from 3.9% in second quarter 2015. 
In addition, year-to-date results include some Maco premiums and other nonroutine items that to the extent they do not continue at the same levels, will put additional pressure on second half 2016 and full year 2017 net investment income and portfolio yields. 
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $7 million before tax. 
To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.31, down 66% from second quarter 2015. Excluding prior-year development and other items listed on the segment results table in the news release, results were down about $0.15 per share or 15% due to higher catastrophe losses and current accident year personal auto results.
Turning to shareholders equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 5.5% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the last 12 months of 7.4% versus our target of 9% over time. The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, but including the charge was 8.9%, while P&C core earnings ROE, which also includes the A&E charge was 10.3%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of common equity. During July, we have repurchased 2 million shares for $89 million, leaving 541 million under -- remaining under the authorization.
As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, this quarter's results were disappointing, largely due to personal auto. As Doug discussed, we have many initiatives under way to improve personal lines margins, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
Aside from Personal Lines, underwriting -- underlying results in the other segments remain strong. In addition, we are pleased to see limited partnership returns back up to our 6% outlook after 3 quarters of low returns. 
While the environment remains challenging, we continue to generate capital and effectively manage the run-off of Talcott. As Chris mentioned, we expected to complete our current capital management plans by year end and will finalize our capital management plans for 2017 by year-end.
I will now turn the call over to Serbia so we can begin the Q&A session."

So if you look at accident year '15% versus accident year '14, we do see that pressure point. At the heart of your question is why we're late on it. I would say this. Number one, our physical damage frequency estimates at year-end for accident year '15 are still holding, so the number of collisions we predicted for that accident year book still look very solid. Didn't change much in the first quarter and have not changed in the second quarter. Second piece, which we talked quite a bit in the first quarter and also have developed in the second quarter, the number of bodies that are injured in those crashes during accident year '15, we're seeing more people injured and we're seeing more coverages influence. So the frequency of components of loss has grown in our 2000 accident year '15 book. And the third piece, which ties into that last statement, our bodily injury severity across the book has had pressure, and that pressure was evident in the first quarter if we look back on '15. And we've seen another point-to-point after pressure in the second quarter. So that really forms the basis for why the changes. We are disappointed that we didn't see all of it, but we've gone back. And it's not like we missed the number of actions in our book. We look -- we are missing the features around them and have made pretty significant changes to make sure to not only are we on top of '15, but we've adjusted for '16 moving ahead."

And if so, was there any change to the stress scenario you had in your 4Q '15 presentation around low rates? Because I guess our had been there wasn't enough market good guy in the test to offset the bad guy of lower rates,  if you will. So just trying to understand that comment better and if this rate impact has changed in that analysis."

Thank you for the question. Let me clarify. What I was referring to is that when we look at surplus generation in Talcott for 2016 with the potential to have to need to increase cash flow testing reserves at the end of the year, that surplus generation of $200 million to $300 million, we could see decrease or be eliminated. I do expect that we will have dividends from Talcott in 2017. What the amount of dividend will be will be dependent of kind of where we end the year at. As we look at our stress scenarios, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital that we have, and we have updated those scenarios for a steeper decline in interest rate. So when we did those scenarios at year-end, we were assuming that the 10-year at the end of '17 would be at 1.61%. And now when we stress that, we're looking at a 10-year of 1.15%. And so with that, our stress margin capital that we shared with you in December would come down and probably be slightly under $1 billion, but I think that still gives us capacity in 2017 to take dividend from Talcott."

But I think with that, it's important just to set the stage, right? Over the last couple years, starting in April of '14, we started rolling out a new class plan designed to improve our competitiveness, particularly in under-penetrated segments. We also expanded our agency distribution around that, appointing some firms, which had no prior relationships with us. And those changes were going on at a time when the industry was starting to lean into higher frequency and some severity news. So probably not the best time to be rolling out a new class plan. I want to give you some evidence of what we've been working on. The last state in that class plan was rolled out in August of last year, August of 15. I was in Florida. We now have the third fine-tuning or iteration of those class plans going into effect across the country. So we've been tuning those plans over this 2-year period. We're also leaning into rates. So our achievement of rate today is greater than we expected the plan to need 6 months ago. And I would say that we're leaning in harder the second half of the year, subject to our work with the various states. So the disappointments as we've leaned into a growth mode over the last couple of years at a very difficult time. Further, some of that growth was more pronounced in several states with higher overall loss cost, such as Florida. When you think about Florida, we go out of retirees in certain parts of the country. Florida, at times, can be one of the more challenging environments, and so we've had to go back and adjust our rate plant and open road plan in some of these states aggressively. The last thing I would say to you is that in Florida as an example, we've seen across the states an emergence of a little bit more pressure and uninsured and underinsured motorists. These claims are the slowest to emerge and have the highest ultimate severity. So this pattern has shifted with these UN claims emerging more slowly over time, and I think our severity dynamic has tied into the emergence of some pressure with AuM. So I'm not making any excuses. We are tackling hard. We're tackling with pricing. We're working the product and the segmentation is hard as ever. We've made pretty material changes to distribution management, both our targeted plans and also our agency partners. And we are working across our claim operation across the country, making sure that we're on every bit of our operating strategy. So Mike, I expect to see brighter days ahead. I would tell you that the last 45 days, we're seeing signs of this progress. We feel very good about July, but July does not make a year and certainly doesn't make a quarter. So we'll talk more about that in the coming quarters."

So very proud in what our brand stands for, our claims, capabilities, our empathy, particularly in the mature segment. Because I think we've earned the right to be a carrier in that segment. I think what it really means though is how do we transition to that as quickly as possible. And you've heard the litany of activities that Doug and the team are focused on, whether it'd be commission actions, whether it'd be appointments.

From a bottom-line perspective, second quarter results were disappointing. Higher prior year development, including A&E, lower current accident year personal auto results, lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses led to a decline in our core earnings. 
However, I am pleased that our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses continued to generate solid underwriting results. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 5% over the prior year and 2% since year end. You all are aware of the challenges our industry is facing due to greater Commercial Lines competition, unfavorable auto loss cost trends and significantly lower interest rates. 
In Commercial Lines, competition is becoming more aggressive, especially in National Accounts and Middle Market. Some companies are expanding into new markets, while other long-standing competitors are now willing to accept lower pricing or weaker terms and conditions. Renewable rate increases are hovering near short-term loss cost trends in most lines, so expanding margins from here will be difficult. 
While we've continued to deliver good Commercial Lines results by focusing on underwriting discipline, retention and maintaining underlying margins, we see fewer opportunities to grow the top line in middle and larger account markets over the next several quarters. We will continue to pick our spots prudently.
In Personal Lines, increased vehicle miles driven as well as distracted driving have continued to put pressure on auto loss cost trends. Based on our analysis of the determination in frequency and severity, we strengthen reserves for accident year 2015 and increased our loss ratio estimate for accident year 2016.  In hindsight, I'm disappointed we didn't recognize earlier the magnitude of the changing trends. Doug will update you on the pricing, underwriting and agency management actions we are taking to get margins back to our target.
Personal Lines is a core business for us, and our 30-plus year relationship with AARP provides a solid foundation for long-term growth opportunities. While it will take time to fully restore profitability to target levels, I'm confident we will begin to see improved margins in this book in early 2017.
Another issue confronting our industry is the macroeconomic environment, especially the decline in interest rates, in part, due to Brexit. As it relates to Brexit, I'm confident that the global insurance markets, which have been managing insurance risk freely across borders for centuries, will make the necessary changes to adapt.  In the meantime, sustained low rates will continue to put pressure on net investment income and place greater emphasis on underwriting results. Our investment team has carefully steered our portfolio through many challenges over the past few years, including the European debt crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We will remain vigilant on the evolving macroeconomic environment and emerging risk.
I'd also highlight our strong risk management capabilities as our hedge programs have performed as expected in this period of heightened market volatility. 
During the quarter, we maintained our pace of capital return to shareholders with over $430 million of share repurchases and common dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned significant capital from Talcott Resolution to the holding company, which Beth will discuss. We expect to complete our current capital management plan of 4.4 billion of common equity repurchases by the end of 2016.  Later this year, we will finalize our plans for 2017.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to note that based on first half results, we now expect the 2016 Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the 93 to 94 range. This reflects favorable homeowners results year-to-date, with an approximate 5-point deterioration in the auto underlying combined ratio compared to our original outlook.  
That said, I'm confident in our approach to the current market conditions. We are taking the right steps to restore personal auto profitability, and we have the discipline to navigate the competitive Commercial Lines and Group Benefits environments. We will continue to build upon our strong franchise and invest for the future, including opportunities like the acquisition of Maxum, which is expected to close today. We will improve our operating capability and maximize efficiency while redeploying excess capital to support long-term shareholder value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."
341546,364958725,1017467,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified.  In Personal Lines, results were disappointing as loss trends in accident year 2015 continued to emerge a",1455,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 
Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified.  In Personal Lines, results were disappointing as loss trends in accident year 2015 continued to emerge adversely to our expectations, driving having both unfavorable prior development and a deterioration in our estimates for accident year 2016. 
Let me get right into Personal Lines, which posted a core loss of $55 million for the quarter, down from core earnings of $42 million last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 94.2, increasing 5.1 points versus last year. This is primarily due to higher auto liability loss cost, which I will discuss in a minute, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. 
Homeowners performance continues to be excellent. We experienced a slight uptick in fire-related losses, but this is compared to a very favorable second quarter 2015. 
CAT losses in the quarter were $104 million, $7 million higher than second quarter 2015, but generally in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the trends of our homeowners book.
Included in the Personal Lines underwriting loss this quarter is $75 million pretax of adverse auto liability development primarily related to accident year 2015. The factors behind this adverse development remain consistent with those we described in the first quarter, which are related to higher employment, resulting in more people on the road. As a consequence, we're seeing both increased frequency and severity of bodily injury claims which generally have the longest reporting lag and highest severity.  Despite our first quarter reserve action, losses from the 2015 accident year emerged well above our previous expectations during the second quarter.
Due to the deterioration in these trends for the 2015 accident year, we also raised our 2016 accident year auto liability loss estimates, essentially carrying forward the 2015 experience. Based on our latest call, we do not expect to achieve the full year Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92 that we provided in February.  This included homeowners of 77 to 79 and auto at 96 to 98. As I noted earlier, homeowners results have been strong, coming in favorable to our expectations. Auto on the other hand is running approximately 5 points adverse to our full year expectations. We now expect the Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 93 to 94. This incorporates our view that the rate of change in auto frequency will moderate for the second half of this year based on the elevated levels that began in the second half of 2015, and that the rate of change in auto severity will continue to hover in the low single-digit range. 
The actions we described last quarter to address the adverse auto liability trends are intensifying. These include a substantial increase in the number of rate filings versus prior year; aggressive non-rate actions to improve our profitability, such as terminating unproductive agency relationships, de-authorizing certain agents from the AARP program, enrolling out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. On the direct side, our marketing efforts are targeted toward preferred customer segments, and we continue to address underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. 
Our 2016 rate actions continued to accelerate, equating to over 200 million of premium on the auto line. The earned premium impact of this rate will follow and, ultimately, is based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in 2017.
As a result of our profit improvement steps, AARP Direct and AARP Agency written premium was up only modestly at 1% and 3%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Other agency was down 17%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix towards AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. 
When I step back and reflect on the first quarter of 2016 for Personal Lines, there's no hiding our disappointment in the results. However, encouraging signs are emerging from our various auto initiatives, and I'm confident that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Now let's shift over to Commercial Lines where we had a solid quarter with core earnings of $224 million, down $40 million from second quarter 2015. The combined ratio was 95, an increase of 2.8 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher CAT losses and lower current accident year margins in Small Commercial and Middle Market, offset by improved margins in Specialty.  Renewal written pricing and Standard Commercial lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to first quarter 2016. 
In Small Commercial, we had another excellent quarter with strong retentions and margins. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9 was 1.8 points higher than last year. The increase is largely due to lower margins on package business, resulting from higher non-catastrophe property and general liability losses, offset by a modest improvement in workers' compensation margins. Recall that property losses were very low a year ago, making this quarter a tough comparison. 
Small Commercial written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention, while new business was off 1% as competitive conditions intensified. We continue to advance our capabilities with initiatives in distribution, product, digital technology and analytics, all of which are crucial in the small commercial market and are helping us maintain our leadership position despite the increasing competition. 
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 91.9, up 2.6 points from second quarter 2015. This was primarily due to less favorable property losses and an increase in expenses.  Similar to Small Commercial, second quarter 2015 benefited from particularly favorable property losses.  Middle Market written premium in the quarter was flat compared to prior year. New business of $124 million increased $5 million over last year, due mainly to solid performance in our industry verticals, which we have been building in recent years as part of our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player. In other areas of Middle Market, we experienced a slight decline in both retention and new business for the quarter. This is the result of our disciplined pricing and underwriting stance in the market with our primary objective centered on maintaining profitability.
Specialty Commercial had a very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4 improved 3.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins in National Accounts and the continued favorable margins in bond and financial products. Specialty Commercial premium was down 2% compared to second quarter '15, reflecting the competitive environment in National Accounts. I'm very pleased with how we're navigating these markets and the pricing discipline we continue to exhibit. 
I've described the marketplace for both Middle Market and National Accounts as increasingly aggressive, particularly for new business. We're seeing relative newcomers, some reemerging incumbents as well as the traditional players offering very competitive pricing. Although we continue to win new business and renew existing accounts at pricing that's both competitive and profitable, we expect that achieving total written premium growth in the near term will be challenging. 
Moving on to Group Benefits. Although core earnings down from last year, the business continues to perform well and is operating from a strong market position with solid returns. Second quarter 2016 core earnings of $46 million was down $10 million, producing a core earnings margin of 5.1%. The decline in core earnings was driven primarily by lower net investment income and higher group life mortality claims. 
The group life loss ratio increased 1.9 points to 78.1 for second quarter 2016. This was primarily due to higher claims severity, which can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. 
Mortality trends remain in line with our expectations.
On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%.  Fully insured ongoing sales were 80 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over second quarter 2015. We feel competitor pressures in this business, too, particularly in long-term disability, but had strong sales this quarter due to a large new account.
In summary, our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses are operating effectively in competitive market conditions, and we remain focused on business retention and margins. Consistent with our philosophy across the enterprise, we are diligently pricing and underwriting, prepared to pass on the business that does not meet our return thresholds. 
In Personal Lines, we have hit a difficult stretch, but are taking numerous actions to address elevated loss cost and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. 
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study",1256,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. 
This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study. As a result of this study, we added $197 million before tax asbestos reserve and $71 million before tax to environmental reserve. The increase in the asbestos reserve was due to mesothelioma claims not decreasing, as expected, over the past year for a small subset of peripheral defendants in adverse jurisdictions. The environmental charge reflects higher claim severity, including for additional properties tendered during settlement discussion and increased legal defense and cleanup costs.  After tax, the A&E development increased $40 million from second quarter 2015, resulting in core losses for the segment of $154 million compared with 4113 million in second quarter 2015. 
We are disappointed with the development on this book. And as we have said before, we continue to evaluate options for these exposures, taking into account factors such as the value we add by managing these claims ourselves, the loss of investment income versus the cost of a transaction, as well as whether it is a partial or permanent transfer of risk. 
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a definitive agreement to sell our U.K. run-off P&C book to Catalina.This agreement provides for a permanent transfer of these liabilities and is not expected to have a material impact on our financials. 
Mutual Funds core earnings were down $2 million from second quarter 2015 due to lower fees as a result of lower assets under management. Total AUM was down about 4% from a year ago, consisting of a 2% decline in Mutual Fund AUM, principally due to lower market values over the past 12 months; and a 15% decline in Talcott variable annuity AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. 
Fund performance remains solid with 62% of all funds and 70% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years.
Mutual Fund net flows were negative $419 million as positive net flows in multi-strategy investments were more than offset by negative flows in equity and fixed income.  Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $107 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined to $91 million, from $171 million in second quarter of 2015, which included a $48 million tax benefit in higher limited partnership income.  Compared to the first quarter of 2016, full surrender activity increased slightly to 7.7% for variable annuities and to 5.1% for fixed annuity.  Surrender activity in the quarter reflects normal run-off as there are no current contract holder initiative. VA surrender activity decreased from second quarter 2015, reflecting the age of the block and is largely consistent with our assumptions. 
We recently received approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance for the $250 million extraordinary dividend that we had expected from Talcott in the second half of 2016, and this amount was received by the holding company in July.  Combined with the $500 million we received in January, Talcott has provided $750 million of capital to the holding company during 2016, as planned. 
We continue to evaluate Talcott's capital generation outlook for 2016, which has been negatively impacted by lower interest rates.  As you may recall, we had a 2016 outlook for $200 million to $300 million of capital generation, which was dependent on markets and the run-off of the book, among other things. Compared to the beginning of the year, equity markets remain high, which supports fee income and earnings. However, as interest rates remain at current levels, we would most likely need to record additional cash flow testing reserves at year-end, which would reduce or eliminate 2016 capital generation at Talcott.  While we have a ways to go until year end and a lot of things can change, this will be a factor for us to consider as we determine dividends for Talcott in 2017. 
I want to emphasize that even at current interest rates, Talcott's base case capital margin remains very strong, and its stress scenario capital margin, while lower than what we calculated in February, is still above our minimum. In short, the low interest rate averment has not changed Talcott's ability to remain capital self-sufficient in a stress scenario.
Turning to investment. Our limited partnership returns totaled $40 million in the second quarter, which is in line with our 6% annualized outlook. All 3 asset classes had positive returns this quarter as contrasted with first quarter 2016 losses and hedge funds in real estate. However, compared with second quarter 2015, limited partnership income was down 57% year-over-year. In second quarter last year, we had especially strong returns in real estate and private equity, resulting in a very difficult comparison.
Excluding limited partnerships, our before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, relatively consistent with the last year. However, we expect the portfolio yield and net investment income to decrease as new money yields remain below the book yield.
While our current projections for full year P&C net investment income, excluding partnerships, is still in line with our original outlook, the P&C portfolio yield, excluding  limited partnership, declined this quarter to 3.8% from 3.9% in second quarter 2015.  In addition, year-to-date results include some make-whole premiums and other nonroutine items that to the extent they do not continue at the same levels, will put additional pressure on second half 2016 and full year 2017 net investment income and portfolio yields. 
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter, with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $7 million before tax. 
To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.31, down 66% from second quarter 2015. Excluding prior year development and other items listed on the segment results table in the news release, results were down about $0.15 per share, or 15%, due to higher catastrophe losses and current accident year personal auto results.
Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 5.5% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the last 12 months of 7.4% versus our target of 9% over time. The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, but including the A&E charge was 8.9%, while P&C core earnings ROE, which also includes the A&E charge, was 10.3%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of common equity. During July, we have repurchased 2 million shares for $89 million, leaving $541 million under -- remaining under the authorization.  As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, this quarter's results were disappointing, largely due to personal auto. As Doug discussed, we have many initiatives underway to improve Personal Lines margins, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
Aside from Personal Lines, underwriting -- underlying results in the other segments remain strong. In addition, we were pleased to see limited partnership returns back up to our 6% outlook after 3 quarters of low returns. 
While the environment remains challenging, we continue to generate capital and effectively manage the run-off of Talcott. As Chris mentioned, we expect to complete our current capital management plans by year-end and will finalize our capital management plans for 2017 by year-end.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

Number one, I think you know, and we should just stat it, there has been pressure across the industry the last couple of years, right? So if you look at accident year '15 versus accident year '14, we do see that pressure point. At the heart of your question is why were we late on it. I would say this; number one, our physical damage frequency estimates at year-end for accident year '15 are still holding. So the number of collisions we predicted for that accident year book still look very solid. Didn't change much in the first quarter and have not changed in the second quarter. Second piece, which we talked quite a bit in the first quarter and also have developed in the second quarter, the number of bodies that are injured in those crashes during accident year '15, we're seeing more people injured and we're seeing more coverages influence. So the frequency of components of loss has grown in our 2000 accident year '15 book. And the third piece, which ties into that last statement, our bodily injury severity across the book has had pressure, and that pressure was evident in the first quarter if we look back on '15. And we've seen another 1 to 1.5 point of pressure in the second quarter. So that really forms the basis for why the changes. We are disappointed that we didn't see all of it, but we've gone back. And it's not like we missed the number of actions in our book. We look -- we are missing the features around them and have made pretty significant changes to make sure not only are we on top of '15, but we've adjusted for '16 moving ahead."

What I was referring to is that when we look at surplus generation in Talcott for 2016 with the potential to have to need to increase cash flow testing reserves at the end of the year, that surplus generation of $200 million to $300 million, we could see decrease or be eliminated. I do expect that we will have dividends from Talcott in 2017. What the amount of dividend it will be dependent of kind of where we end the year at. As we look at our stress scenarios, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital that we have, and we have updated those scenarios for a steeper decline in interest rates. So when we did those scenarios at year-end, we were assuming that the 10-year at the end of '17 would be at 1.61%. And now, when we stress that, we're looking at a 10-year of 1.15%. And so with that, our stress margin capital that we shared with you in December would come down and probably be slightly under $1 billion. But I think that still gives us capacity in 2017 to take dividends from Talcott."

But I think with that, it's important just to set the stage, right? Over the last couple of years, starting in April of '14, we started rolling out a new class plan designed to improve our competitiveness, particularly in under-penetrated segments. We also expanded our agency distribution around that, appointing some firms, which had no prior relationships with us. And those changes were going on at a time when the industry was starting to lean into higher frequency and some severity news. So probably not the best time to be rolling out a new class plan. I want to give you some evidence of what we've been working on. The last state in that class plan was rolled out in August of last year, August of '15. That was Florida. We now have the third fine-tuning or iteration of those class plans going into effect across the country. So we've been tuning those plans over this 2-year period. We're also leaning into rates. So our achievement of rate today is greater than we expected the plan to need 6 months ago. And I would say that we're leaning in harder the second half of the year, subject to our work with the various states. So the disappointment is we've leaned into a growth mode over the last couple of years at a very difficult time. Further, some of that growth was more pronounced in several states with higher overall loss cost, such as Florida. When you think about Florida, we've get a lot of retirees in certain pockets of the country. Florida, at times, can be one of the more challenging environments, and so we've had to go back and adjust our rate plan and open road plan in some of these states aggressively. The last thing I would say to you is that in Florida as an example, we've seen across the states an emergence of a little bit more pressure in uninsured and underinsured motorists. These claims are the slowest to emerge and have the highest ultimate severity. So this pattern has shifted with these UM claims emerging more slowly over time, and I think our severity dynamic has tied into the emergence of some pressure with UM. So I'm not making any excuses. We are tackling hard. We're tackling with pricing. We're working the product and the segmentation is hard as ever. We've made pretty material changes to distribution management, both our targeted plans and also our agency partners. And we're working across our claim operation across the country, making sure that we're on every bit of our operating strategy. So Mike, I expect to see brighter days ahead. I will tell you, the last 45 days, we're seeing signs of this progress. Feel very good about July. But July does not make a year, and certainly doesn't make a quarter. So we'll talk more about that in the coming quarters."

So the numbers I shared on new are more reflection of how we're moving into these territories and the customers we're seeking to add and build to our book.

From a bottom-line perspective, second quarter results were disappointing. Higher prior year development, including A&E, lower current accident year personal auto results, lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses led to a decline in our core earnings. 
However, I am pleased that our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses continued to generate solid underwriting results. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 5% over the prior year and 2% since year end. You all are aware of the challenges our industry is facing due to greater commercial lines competition, unfavorable auto loss cost trends and significantly lower interest rates. 
In Commercial Lines, competition is becoming more aggressive, especially in National Accounts and Middle Market. Some companies are expanding into new markets, while other long-standing competitors are now willing to accept lower pricing or weaker terms and conditions. Renewable rate increases are hovering near short-term loss cost trends in most lines, so expanding margins from here will be difficult. 
While we've continued to deliver good Commercial Lines results by focusing on underwriting discipline, retention and maintaining underlying margins, we see fewer opportunities to grow the top line in middle and larger account markets over the next several quarters. We will continue to pick our spots prudently.
In Personal Lines, increased vehicle miles driven as well as distracted driving have continued to put pressure on auto loss cost trends. Based on our analysis of the deterioration in frequency and severity, we strengthen reserves for accident year 2015 and increased our loss ratio estimate for accident year 2016. In hindsight, I'm disappointed we didn't recognize earlier the magnitude of the changing trends. Doug will update you on the pricing, underwriting and agency management actions we are taking to get margins back to our targets.
Personal Lines is a core business for us, and our 30-plus year relationship with AARP provides a solid foundation for long-term growth opportunities. While it will take time to fully restore profitability to target levels, I'm confident we will begin to see improved margins in this book in early 2017.
Another issue confronting our industry is the macroeconomic environment, especially the decline in interest rates, in part due to Brexit. As it relates to Brexit, I'm confident that the global insurance markets, which have been managing insurance risk freely across borders for centuries, will make the necessary changes to adapt. In the meantime, sustained low rates will continue to put pressure on net investment income and place greater emphasis on underwriting results. Our investment team has carefully steered our portfolio through many challenges over the past few years, including the European debt crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We will remain vigilant on the evolving macroeconomic environment and emerging risk.
I'd also highlight our strong risk management capabilities as our hedge programs have performed as expected in this period of heightened market volatility. 
During the quarter, we maintained our pace of capital return to shareholders, with over $430 million of share repurchases and common dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned significant capital from Talcott Resolution to the holding company, which Beth will discuss. We expect to complete our current capital management plan of 4.4 billion of common equity repurchases by the end of 2016. Later this year, we will finalize our plans for 2017.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to note that based on first half results, we now expect the 2016 Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the 93 to 94 range. This reflects favorable homeowners results year-to-date, with an approximate 5-point deterioration in the auto underlying combined ratio compared to our original outlook.  
That said, I'm confident in our approach to the current market conditions. We are taking the right steps to restore personal auto profitability, and we have the discipline to navigate the competitive Commercial Lines and Group Benefits environments. We will continue to build upon our strong franchise and invest for the future, including opportunities like the acquisition of Maxum, which is expected to close today. We will improve our operating capability and maximize efficiency while redeploying excess capital to support long-term shareholder value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified.

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified. In Personal Lines, results were disappointing as loss trends in accident year 2015 continued to emerge adversely to our expectations, driving having both unfavorable prior development and a deterioration in our estimates for accident year 2016. 
Let me get right into Personal Lines, which posted a core loss of $55 million for the quarter, down from core earnings of $42 million last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 94.2, increasing 5.1 points versus last year. This is primarily due to higher auto liability loss costs, which I will discuss in a minute, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. 
Homeowners performance continues to be excellent. We experienced a slight uptick in fire-related losses, but this is compared to a very favorable second quarter 2015. 
CAT losses in the quarter were $104 million, $7 million higher than second quarter 2015, but generally in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the trends of our Homeowners book.
Included in the Personal Lines underwriting loss this quarter is $75 million pretax of adverse auto liability development primarily related to accident year 2015. The factors behind this adverse development remain consistent with those we described in the first quarter, which are related to higher employment, resulting in more people on the road. As a consequence, we're seeing both increased frequency and severity of bodily injury claims, which generally have the longest reporting lag and highest severity. Despite our first quarter reserve action, losses from the 2015 accident year emerged well above our previous expectations during the second quarter.
Due to the deterioration in these trends for the 2015 accident year, we also raised our 2016 accident year auto liability loss estimates, essentially carrying forward the 2015 experience. Based on our latest call, we do not expect to achieve the full year Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92 that we provided in February. This included homeowners of 77 to 79 and auto at 96 to 98. As I noted earlier, Homeowners results have been strong, coming in favorable to our expectations. Auto, on the other hand, is running approximately 5 points adverse to our full year expectations. We now expect the Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 93 to 94. This incorporates our view that the rate of change in auto frequency will moderate for the second half of this year based on the elevated levels that began in the second half of 2015, and that the rate of change in auto severity will continue to hover in the low single-digit range. 
The actions we described last quarter to address the adverse auto liability trends are intensifying. These include a substantial increase in the number of rate filings versus prior year; aggressive non-rate actions to improve our profitability, such as terminating unproductive agency relationships, de-authorizing certain agents from the AARP program, enrolling out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. On the direct side, our marketing efforts are targeted toward preferred customer segments, and we continue to address underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. 
Our 2016 rate actions continue to accelerate, equating to over 200 million of premium on the auto line. The earned premium impact of this rate will follow and, ultimately, is based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in 2017.
As a result of our profit improvement steps, AARP Direct and AARP Agency written premium was up only modestly at 1% and 3%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Other agency was down 17%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix towards AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. 
When I step back and reflect on the first quarter of 2016 for Personal Lines, there's no hiding our disappointment in the results. However, encouraging signs are emerging from our various auto initiatives, and I'm confident that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Now let's shift over to Commercial Lines, where we had a solid quarter with core earnings of $224 million, down $40 million from second quarter 2015. The combined ratio was 95, an increase of 2.8 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher CAT losses and lower current accident year margins in Small Commercial and Middle Market, offset by improved margins in Specialty. Renewal written pricing and Standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to first quarter 2016. 
In Small Commercial, we had another excellent quarter, with strong retentions and margins. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9 was 1.8 points higher than last year. The increase is largely due to lower margins on package business, resulting from higher non-catastrophe property and general liability losses, offset by a modest improvement in workers' compensation margins. Recall that property losses were very low a year ago, making this quarter a tough comparison. 
Small Commercial written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention, while new business was off 1% as competitive conditions intensified. We continue to advance our capabilities with initiatives in distribution, product, digital technology and analytics, all of which are crucial in the small commercial market and are helping us maintain our leadership position despite the increasing competition. 
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 91.9, up 2.6 points from second quarter 2015. This was primarily due to less favorable property losses and an increase in expenses. Similar to Small Commercial, second quarter 2015 benefited from particularly favorable property losses. Middle Market written premium in the quarter was flat compared to prior year. New business of $124 million increased $5 million over last year, due mainly to solid performance in our industry verticals, which we have been building in recent years as part of our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player. In other areas of Middle Market, we experienced a slight decline in both retention and new business for the quarter. This is the result of our disciplined pricing and underwriting stance in the market, with our primary objective centered on maintaining profitability.
Specialty Commercial had a very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4 improved 3.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins in National Accounts and the continued favorable margins in bond and financial products. Specialty Commercial premium was down 2% compared to second quarter '15, reflecting the competitive environment in National Accounts. I'm very pleased with how we're navigating these markets and the pricing discipline we continue to exhibit. 
I've described the marketplace for both Middle Market and National Accounts as increasingly aggressive, particularly for new business. We're seeing relative newcomers, some reemerging incumbents as well as the traditional players offering very competitive pricing. Although we continue to win new business and renew existing accounts at pricing that's both competitive and profitable, we expect that achieving total written premium growth in the near term will be challenging. 
Moving on to Group Benefits. Although core earnings is down from last year, the business continues to perform well and is operating from a strong market position with solid returns. Second quarter 2016 core earnings of $46 million was down $10 million, producing a core earnings margin of 5.1%. The decline in core earnings was driven primarily by lower net investment income and higher group life mortality claims. 
The group life loss ratio increased 1.9 points to 78.1 for second quarter 2016. This was primarily due to higher claims severity, which can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. 
Mortality trends remain in line with our expectations.
On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $80 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over second quarter 2015. We feel competitor pressures in this business, too, particularly in long-term disability, but had strong sales this quarter due to a large new account.
In summary, our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses are operating effectively in competitive market conditions, and we remain focused on business retention and margins. Consistent with our philosophy across the enterprise, we are diligently pricing and underwriting, prepared to pass on the business that does not meet our return thresholds. 
In Personal Lines, we have hit a difficult stretch, but are taking numerous actions to address elevated loss cost and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. 
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study",1259,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. 
This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study. As a result of this study, we added $197 million before tax asbestos reserves and $71 million before tax to environmental reserves. The increase in the asbestos reserves was due to mesothelioma claims not decreasing, as expected, over the past year for a small subset of peripheral defendants in adverse jurisdictions. The environmental charge reflects higher claim severity, including for additional properties tendered during settlement discussion and increased legal defense and cleanup costs. After tax, the A&E development increased $40 million from second quarter 2015, resulting in core losses for the segment of $154 million compared with $113 million in second quarter 2015. 
We are disappointed with the development on this book. And as we have said before, we continue to evaluate options for these exposures, taking into account factors such as the value we add by managing these claims ourselves, the loss of investment income versus the cost of a transaction, as well as whether it is a partial or permanent transfer of risk. 
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a definitive agreement to sell our U.K. run-off P&C book to Catalina. This agreement provides for a permanent transfer of these liabilities and is not expected to have a material impact on our financials. 
Mutual Funds core earnings were down $2 million from second quarter 2015 due to lower fees as a result of lower assets under management. Total AUM was down about 4% from a year ago, consisting of a 2% decline in Mutual Fund AUM, principally due to lower market values over the past 12 months; and a 15% decline in Talcott variable annuity AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. 
Fund performance remains solid, with 62% of all funds and 70% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years.
Mutual Fund net flows were a negative $419 million as positive net flows in multi-strategy investments were more than offset by negative flows in equity and fixed income.  Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $107 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined to $91 million, from $171 million in second quarter of 2015, which included a $48 million tax benefit in higher limited partnership income. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, full surrender activity increased slightly to 7.7% for variable annuities and to 5.1% for fixed annuities. Surrender activity in the quarter reflects normal run-off as there are no current contract holder initiative. VA surrender activity decreased from second quarter 2015, reflecting the age of the block and is largely consistent with our assumptions. 
We recently received approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance for the $250 million extraordinary dividend that we had expected from Talcott in the second half of 2016, and this amount was received by the holding company in July. Combined with the $500 million we received in January, Talcott has provided $750 million of capital to the holding company during 2016, as planned. 
We continue to evaluate Talcott's capital generation outlook for 2016, which has been negatively impacted by lower interest rates.  As you may recall, we had a 2016 outlook for $200 million to $300 million of capital generation, which was dependent on markets and the run-off of the book, among other things. Compared to the beginning of the year, equity markets remain high, which supports fee income and earnings. However, as interest rates remain at current levels, we would most likely need to record additional cash flow testing reserves at year-end, which would reduce or eliminate 2016 capital generation at Talcott. While we have a ways to go until year end and a lot of things can change, this will be a factor for us to consider as we determine dividends for Talcott in 2017. 
I want to emphasize that even at current interest rates, Talcott's base case capital margin remains very strong, and its stress scenario capital margin, while lower than what we calculated in February, is still above our minimum. In short, the low interest rate averment has not changed Talcott's ability to remain capital self-sufficient in a stress scenario.
Turning to investments. Our limited partnership returns totaled $40 million in the second quarter, which is in line with our 6% annualized outlook. All 3 asset classes had positive returns this quarter as contrasted with first quarter 2016 losses and hedge funds in real estate. However, compared with second quarter 2015, limited partnership income was down 57% year-over-year. In second quarter last year, we had especially strong returns in real estate and private equity, resulting in a very difficult comparison.
Excluding limited partnerships, our before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, relatively consistent with the last year. However, we expect the portfolio yield and net investment income to decrease as new money yields remain below the book yields.
While our current projections for full year P&C net investment income, excluding partnerships, is still in line with our original outlook, the P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership, declined this quarter to 3.8% from 3.9% in second quarter 2015. In addition, year-to-date results include some make-whole premiums and other nonroutine items that to the extent they do not continue at the same levels, will put additional pressure on second half 2016 and full year 2017 net investment income and portfolio yields. 
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter, with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $7 million before tax. 
To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.31, down 66% from second quarter 2015. Excluding prior year development and other items listed on the segment results table in the news release, results were down about $0.15 per share, or 15%, due to higher catastrophe losses and current accident year personal auto results.
Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 5.5% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends, over the last 12 months of 7.4% versus our target of 9% over time. The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott but including the A&E charge, was 8.9%, while P&C core earnings ROE, which also includes the A&E charge, was 10.3%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of common equity. During July, we have repurchased 2 million shares for $89 million, leaving $541 million under -- remaining under the authorization. As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, this quarter's results were disappointing, largely due to personal auto. As Doug discussed, we have many initiatives under way to improve Personal Lines margins, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
Aside from Personal Lines, underwriting -- underlying results in the other segments remain strong. In addition, we were pleased to see limited partnership returns back up to our 6% outlook after 3 quarters of low returns. 
While the environment remains challenging, we continue to generate capital and effectively manage the run-off of Talcott. As Chris mentioned, we expect to complete our current capital management plans by year-end and will finalize our capital management plans for 2017 by year-end.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

I would say this, number one, our physical damage frequency estimates at year-end for accident year '15 are still holding. So the number of collisions we predicted for that accident year book still look very solid. Didn't change much in the first quarter and have not changed in the second quarter. Second piece, which we talked quite a bit in the first quarter and also have developed in the second quarter, the number of bodies that are injured in those crashes during accident year '15, we're seeing more people injured and we're seeing more coverages influence. So the frequency of components of loss has grown in our 2000 -- accident year '15 book. And the third piece, which ties into that last statement, our bodily injury severity across the book has had pressure, and that pressure was evident in the first quarter if we look back on '15. And we've seen another 1 to 1.5 point of pressure in the second quarter. So that really forms the basis for why the changes. We are disappointed that we didn't see all of it, but we've gone back. And it's not like we missed the number of actions in our book. We look -- we are missing the features around them and have made pretty significant changes to make sure not only are we on top of '15, but we've adjusted for '16 moving ahead."

What I was referring to is that when we look at surplus generation in Talcott for 2016 with the potential to have the need to increase cash flow testing reserves at the end of the year, that surplus generation of $200 million to $300 million we could see decrease or be eliminated. I do expect that we will have dividends from Talcott in 2017. What the amount of dividend will be, will be dependent on kind of where we end the year at. As we look at our stress scenarios, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital that we have, and we have updated those scenarios for a steeper decline in interest rates. So when we did those scenarios at year-end, we were assuming that the 10-year at the end of '17 would be at 1.61%. And now, when we stress that, we're looking at a 10-year of 1.15%. And so with that, our stress margin capital that we shared with you in December would come down and probably be slightly under $1 billion. But I think that still gives us capacity in 2017 to take dividends from Talcott."

But when I look at the supplement and look at rate-taking activity there, it looks like you've gone from 5% before anything manifested to about 7% now. So I'd like to square that to your comment about significant rate taking. But your policy count retention is flat and new business has come off modestly. So I'm just trying to square all of those things. Like how is it that with everything that's taken place, that we're not seeing the foot come off the gas entirely? Why is new -- why is there any new business? And why isn't retention coming down further?"

But I think with that, it's important just to set the stage, right? Over the last couple of years, starting in April of '14, we started rolling out a new class plan designed to improve our competitiveness, particularly in under-penetrated segments. We also expanded our agency distribution around that, appointing some firms, which had no prior relationships with us. And those changes were going on at a time when the industry was starting to lean into higher frequency and some severity news. So probably not the best time to be rolling out a new class plan. I want to give you some evidence of what we've been working on. The last state in that class plan was rolled out in August of last year, August of '15. That was Florida. We now have the third fine-tuning or iteration of those class plans going into effect across the country. So we've been tuning those plans over this 2-year period. We're also leaning into rates. So our achievement of rate today is greater than we expected the plan to need 6 months ago. And I would say that we're leaning in harder the second half of the year, subject to our work with the various states. So the disappointment is we've leaned into a growth mode over the last couple of years at a very difficult time. Further, some of that growth was more pronounced in several states with higher overall loss costs, such as Florida. When you think about Florida, we've get a lot of retirees in certain pockets of the country. Florida, at times, can be one of the more challenging environments, and so we've had to go back and adjust our rate plan and open road plan in some of these states aggressively. The last thing I would say to you is that, and Florida is an example, we've seen across the states an emergence of a little bit more pressure in uninsured and underinsured motorists. These claims are the slowest to emerge and have the highest ultimate severity. So this pattern has shifted, with these UM claims emerging more slowly over time, and I think our severity dynamic has tied into the emergence of some pressure with UM. So I'm not making any excuses. We are tackling hard. We're tackling with pricing. We're working the product and the segmentation as hard as ever. We've made pretty material changes to distribution management, both our targeted plans and also our agency partners. And we're working across our claim operation across the country, making sure that we're on every bit of our operating strategy. So, Mike, I expect to see brighter days ahead. I will tell you in the last 45 days, we're seeing signs of this progress. Feel very good about July. But July does not make a year, and certainly doesn't make a quarter. So we'll talk more about that in the coming quarters."

So the numbers I shared on new are more reflection of how we're moving into these territories and the customers we're seeking to add and build to our book. But the retention strategies are tied into a rate adequacy, and in some places, we're very rate-adequate, and other places need a lot of work. And the numbers you're looking at are averages.

From a bottom-line perspective, second quarter results were disappointing. Higher prior year development, including A&E, lower current accident year personal auto results, lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses led to a decline in our core earnings. 
However, I am pleased that our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses continued to generate solid underwriting results. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 5% over the prior year and 2% since year end. You all are aware of the challenges our industry is facing due to greater commercial lines competition, unfavorable auto loss cost trends and significantly lower interest rates. 
In Commercial Lines, competition is becoming more aggressive, especially in National Accounts and Middle Market. Some companies are expanding into new markets, while other long-standing competitors are now willing to accept lower pricing or weaker terms and conditions. Renewal rate increases are hovering near short-term loss cost trends in most lines, so expanding margins from here will be difficult. 
While we've continued to deliver good Commercial Lines results by focusing on underwriting discipline, retention and maintaining underlying margins, we see fewer opportunities to grow the top line in middle and larger account markets over the next several quarters. We will continue to pick our spots prudently.
In Personal Lines, increased vehicle miles driven as well as distracted driving have continued to put pressure on auto loss cost trends. Based on our analysis of the deterioration in frequency and severity, we strengthened reserves for accident year 2015 and increased our loss ratio estimate for accident year 2016. In hindsight, I'm disappointed we didn't recognize earlier the magnitude of the changing trends. Doug will update you on the pricing, underwriting and agency management actions we are taking to get margins back to our targets.
Personal Lines is a core business for us, and our 30-plus year relationship with AARP provides a solid foundation for long-term growth opportunities. While it will take time to fully restore profitability to target levels, I'm confident we will begin to see improved margins in this book in early 2017.
Another issue confronting our industry is the macroeconomic environment, especially the decline in interest rates, in part due to Brexit. As it relates to Brexit, I'm confident that the global insurance markets, which have been managing insurance risk freely across borders for centuries, will make the necessary changes to adapt. In the meantime, sustained low rates will continue to put pressure on net investment income and place greater emphasis on underwriting results. Our investment team has carefully steered our portfolio through many challenges over the past few years, including the European debt crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We will remain vigilant on the evolving macroeconomic environment and emerging risk.
I'd also highlight our strong risk management capabilities as our hedge programs have performed as expected in this period of heightened market volatility. 
During the quarter, we maintained our pace of capital return to shareholders, with over $430 million of share repurchases and common dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned significant capital from Talcott Resolution to the holding company, which Beth will discuss. We expect to complete our current capital management plan of 4.4 billion of common equity repurchases by the end of 2016. Later this year, we will finalize our plans for 2017.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to note that based on first half results, we now expect the 2016 Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the 93 to 94 range. This reflects favorable homeowners results year-to-date, with an approximate 5-point deterioration in the auto underlying combined ratio compared to our original outlook.  
That said, I'm confident in our approach to the current market conditions. We are taking the right steps to restore personal auto profitability, and we have the discipline to navigate the competitive Commercial Lines and Group Benefits environments. We will continue to build upon our strong franchise and invest for the future, including opportunities like the acquisition of Maxum, which is expected to close today. We will improve our operating capability and maximize efficiency while redeploying excess capital to support long-term shareholder value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."
341546,364958725,1017834,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified.

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified. In Personal Lines, results were disappointing as loss trends in accident year 2015 continued to emerge adversely to our expectations, driving both unfavorable prior development and a deterioration in our estimates for accident year 2016. 
Let me get right into Personal Lines, which posted a core loss of $55 million for the quarter, down from core earnings of $42 million last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 94.2, increasing 5.1 points versus last year. This is primarily due to higher auto liability loss costs, which I will discuss in a minute, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. 
Homeowners performance continues to be excellent. We experienced a slight uptick in fire-related losses, but this is compared to a very favorable second quarter 2015. 
CAT losses in the quarter were $104 million, $7 million higher than second quarter 2015, but generally in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the trends of our Homeowners book.
Included in the Personal Lines underwriting loss this quarter is $75 million pretax of adverse auto liability development primarily related to accident year 2015. The factors behind this adverse development remain consistent with those we described in the first quarter, which are related to higher employment, resulting in more people on the road. As a consequence, we're seeing both increased frequency and severity of bodily injury claims, which generally have the longest reporting lag and highest severity. Despite our first quarter reserve action, losses from the 2015 accident year emerged well above our previous expectations during the second quarter.
Due to the deterioration in these trends for the 2015 accident year, we also raised our 2016 accident year auto liability loss estimates, essentially carrying forward the 2015 experience. Based on our latest call, we do not expect to achieve the full year Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92 that we provided in February. This included homeowners at 77 to 79 and auto at 96 to 98. As I noted earlier, Homeowners results have been strong, coming in favorable to our expectations. Auto, on the other hand, is running approximately 5 points adverse to our full year expectations. We now expect the Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 93 to 94. This incorporates our view that the rate of change in auto frequency will moderate for the second half of this year based on the elevated levels that began in the second half of 2015, and that the rate of change in auto severity will continue to hover in the low single-digit range. 
The actions we described last quarter to address the adverse auto liability trends are intensifying. These include a substantial increase in the number of rate filings versus prior year; aggressive non-rate actions to improve our profitability, such as terminating unproductive agency relationships, de-authorizing certain agents from the AARP program, and rolling out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. On the direct side, our marketing efforts are targeted toward preferred customer segments, and we continue to address underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. 
Our 2016 rate actions continue to accelerate, equating to over 200 million of premium on the auto line. The earned premium impact of this rate will follow and, ultimately, is based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in 2017.
As a result of our profit improvement steps, AARP Direct and AARP Agency written premium was up only modestly at 1% and 3%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Other agency was down 17%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix towards AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. 
When I step back and reflect on the first quarter of 2016 for Personal Lines, there's no hiding our disappointment in the results. However, encouraging signs are emerging from our various auto initiatives, and I'm confident that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Now let's shift over to Commercial Lines, where we had a solid quarter with core earnings of $224 million, down $40 million from second quarter 2015. The combined ratio was 95, an increase of 2.8 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher CAT losses and lower current accident year margins in Small Commercial and Middle Market, offset by improved margins in Specialty. Renewal written pricing and Standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to first quarter 2016. 
In Small Commercial, we had another excellent quarter, with strong retentions and margins. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9 was 1.8 points higher than last year. The increase is largely due to lower margins on package business, resulting from higher non-catastrophe property and general liability losses, offset by a modest improvement in workers' compensation margins. Recall that property losses were very low a year ago, making this quarter a tough comparison. 
Small Commercial written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention, while new business was off 1% as competitive conditions intensified. We continue to advance our capabilities with initiatives in distribution, product, digital technology and analytics, all of which are crucial in the small commercial market and are helping us maintain our leadership position despite the increasing competition. 
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 91.9, up 2.6 points from second quarter 2015. This was primarily due to less favorable property losses and an increase in expenses. Similar to Small Commercial, second quarter 2015 benefited from particularly favorable property losses. Middle Market written premium in the quarter was flat compared to prior year. New business of $124 million increased $5 million over last year, due mainly to solid performance in our industry verticals, which we have been building in recent years as part of our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player. In other areas of Middle Market, we experienced a slight decline in both retention and new business for the quarter. This is the result of our disciplined pricing and underwriting stance in the market, with our primary objective centered on maintaining profitability.
Specialty Commercial had a very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4 improved 3.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins in National Accounts and the continued favorable margins in Bond and Financial Products. Specialty Commercial premium was down 2% compared to second quarter '15, reflecting the competitive environment in National Accounts. I'm very pleased with how we're navigating these markets and the pricing discipline we continue to exhibit. 
I'd describe the marketplace for both Middle Market and National Accounts as increasingly aggressive, particularly for new business. We're seeing relative newcomers, some reemerging incumbents as well as the traditional players offering very competitive pricing. Although we continue to win new business and renew existing accounts at pricing that's both competitive and profitable, we expect that achieving total written premium growth in the near term will be challenging. 
Moving on to Group Benefits. Although core earnings is down from last year, the business continues to perform well and is operating from a strong market position with solid returns. Second quarter 2016 core earnings of $46 million was down $10 million, producing a core earnings margin of 5.1%. The decline in core earnings was driven primarily by lower net investment income and higher group life mortality claims. 
The group life loss ratio increased 1.9 points to 78.1 for second quarter 2016. This was primarily due to higher claims severity, which can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. 
Mortality trends remain in line with our expectations.
On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $80 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over second quarter 2015. We feel competitor pressures in this business, too, particularly in long-term disability, but had strong sales this quarter due to a large new account.
In summary, our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses are operating effectively in competitive market conditions, and we remain focused on business retention and margins. Consistent with our philosophy across the enterprise, we are diligently pricing and underwriting, prepared to pass on the business that does not meet our return thresholds. 
In Personal Lines, we have hit a difficult stretch, but are taking numerous actions to address elevated loss cost and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. 
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study",1259,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. 
This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study. As a result of this study, we added $197 million before tax asbestos reserves and $71 million before tax to environmental reserves. The increase in the asbestos reserves was due to mesothelioma claims not decreasing, as expected, over the past year for a small subset of peripheral defendants in adverse jurisdictions. The environmental charge reflects higher claim severity, including for additional properties tendered during settlement discussion and increased legal defense and cleanup costs. After tax, the A&E development increased $40 million from second quarter 2015, resulting in core losses for the segment of $154 million compared with $113 million in second quarter 2015. 
We are disappointed with the development on this book. And as we have said before, we continue to evaluate options for these exposures, taking into account factors such as the value we add by managing these claims ourselves, the loss of investment income versus the cost of a transaction, as well as whether it is a partial or permanent transfer of risk. 
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a definitive agreement to sell our U.K. run-off P&C book to Catalina. This agreement provides for a permanent transfer of these liabilities and is not expected to have a material impact on our financials. 
Mutual Funds core earnings were down $2 million from second quarter 2015 due to lower fees as a result of lower assets under management. Total AUM was down about 4% from a year ago, consisting of a 2% decline in Mutual Fund AUM, principally due to lower market values over the past 12 months; and a 15% decline in Talcott variable annuity AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. 
Fund performance remains solid, with 62% of all funds and 70% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years.
Mutual Fund net flows were a negative $419 million as positive net flows in multi-strategy investments were more than offset by negative flows in equity and fixed income.  Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $107 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined to $91 million, from $171 million in second quarter of 2015, which included a $48 million tax benefit in higher limited partnership income. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, full surrender activity increased slightly to 7.7% for variable annuities and to 5.1% for fixed annuities. Surrender activity in the quarter reflects normal run-off as there are no current contract holder initiative. VA surrender activity decreased from second quarter 2015, reflecting the age of the block and is largely consistent with our assumptions. 
We recently received approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance for the $250 million extraordinary dividend that we had expected from Talcott in the second half of 2016, and this amount was received by the holding company in July. Combined with the $500 million we received in January, Talcott has provided $750 million of capital to the holding company during 2016, as planned. 
We continue to evaluate Talcott's capital generation outlook for 2016, which has been negatively impacted by lower interest rates.  As you may recall, we had a 2016 outlook for $200 million to $300 million of capital generation, which was dependent on markets and the run-off of the book, among other things. Compared to the beginning of the year, equity markets remain high, which supports fee income and earnings. However, as interest rates remain at current levels, we would most likely need to record additional cash flow testing reserves at year-end, which would reduce or eliminate 2016 capital generation at Talcott. While we have a ways to go until year end and a lot of things can change, this will be a factor for us to consider as we determine dividends for Talcott in 2017. 
I want to emphasize that even at current interest rates, Talcott's base case capital margin remains very strong, and its stress scenario capital margin, while lower than what we calculated in February, is still above our minimum. In short, the low interest rate averment has not changed Talcott's ability to remain capital self-sufficient in a stress scenario.
Turning to investments. Our limited partnership returns totaled $40 million in the second quarter, which is in line with our 6% annualized outlook. All 3 asset classes had positive returns this quarter as contrasted with first quarter 2016 losses in hedge funds and real estate. However, compared with second quarter 2015, limited partnership income was down 57% year-over-year. In second quarter last year, we had especially strong returns in real estate and private equity, resulting in a very difficult comparison.
Excluding limited partnerships, our before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, relatively consistent with the last year. However, we expect the portfolio yield and net investment income to decrease as new money yields remain below the book yields.
While our current projections for full year P&C net investment income, excluding partnerships, is still in line with our original outlook, the P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership, declined this quarter to 3.8% from 3.9% in second quarter 2015. In addition, year-to-date results include some make-whole premiums and other nonroutine items that to the extent they do not continue at the same levels, will put additional pressure on second half 2016 and full year 2017 net investment income and portfolio yields. 
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter, with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $7 million before tax. 
To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.31, down 66% from second quarter 2015. Excluding prior year development and other items listed on the segment results table in the news release, results were down about $0.15 per share, or 15%, due to higher catastrophe losses and current accident year personal auto results.
Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 5.5% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends, over the last 12 months of 7.4% versus our target of 9% over time. The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott but including the A&E charge, was 8.9%, while P&C core earnings ROE, which also includes the A&E charge, was 10.3%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of common equity. During July, we have repurchased 2 million shares for $89 million, leaving $541 million under -- remaining under the authorization. As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, this quarter's results were disappointing, largely due to personal auto. As Doug discussed, we have many initiatives under way to improve Personal Lines margins, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
Aside from Personal Lines, underwriting -- underlying results in the other segments remain strong. In addition, we were pleased to see limited partnership returns back up to our 6% outlook after 3 quarters of low returns. 
While the environment remains challenging, we continue to generate capital and effectively manage the run-off of Talcott. As Chris mentioned, we expect to complete our current capital management plans by year-end and will finalize our capital management plans for 2017 by year-end.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

Number one, I think you know, and we should just state it, there has been pressure across the industry the last couple of years, right? So if you look at accident year '15 versus accident year '14, we do see that pressure point. At the heart of your question is why were we late on it. I would say this, number one, our physical damage frequency estimates at year-end for accident year '15 are still holding. So the number of collisions we predicted for that accident year book still look very solid. Didn't change much in the first quarter and have not changed in the second quarter. Second piece, which we talked quite a bit in the first quarter and also have developed in the second quarter, the number of bodies that are injured in those crashes during accident year '15, we're seeing more people injured and we're seeing more coverages influence. So the frequency of components of loss has grown in our 2000 -- accident year '15 book. And the third piece, which ties into that last statement, our bodily injury severity across the book has had pressure, and that pressure was evident in the first quarter if we look back on '15. And we've seen another 1 to 1.5 point of pressure in the second quarter. So that really forms the basis for why the changes. We are disappointed that we didn't see all of it, but we've gone back. And it's not like we missed the number of actions in our book. We look -- we are missing the features around them and have made pretty significant changes to make sure not only are we on top of '15, but we've adjusted for '16 moving ahead."

I do expect that we will have dividends from Talcott in 2017. What the amount of dividend will be, will be dependent on kind of where we end the year at. As we look at our stress scenarios, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital that we have, and we have updated those scenarios for a steeper decline in interest rates. So when we did those scenarios at year-end, we were assuming that the 10-year at the end of '17 would be at 1.61%. And now, when we stress that, we're looking at a 10-year of 1.15%. And so with that, our stress margin capital that we shared with you in December would come down and probably be slightly under $1 billion. But I think that still gives us capacity in 2017 to take dividends from Talcott."

But I think with that, it's important just to set the stage, right? Over the last couple of years, starting in April of '14, we started rolling out a new class plan designed to improve our competitiveness, particularly in under-penetrated segments. We also expanded our agency distribution around that, appointing some firms, which had no prior relationships with us. And those changes were going on at a time when the industry was starting to lean into higher frequency and some severity news. So probably not the best time to be rolling out a new class plan. I want to give you some evidence of what we've been working on. The last state in that class plan was rolled out in August of last year, August of '15. That was Florida. We now have the third fine-tuning or iteration of those class plans going into effect across the country. So we've been tuning those plans over this 2-year period. We're also leaning into rates. So our achievement of rate today is greater than we expected the plan to need 6 months ago. And I would say that we're leaning in harder the second half of the year, subject to our work with the various states. So the disappointment is we've leaned into a growth mode over the last couple of years at a very difficult time. Further, some of that growth was more pronounced in several states with higher overall loss costs, such as Florida. When you think about Florida, we've get a lot of retirees in certain pockets of the country. Florida, at times, can be one of the more challenging environments, and so we've had to go back and adjust our rate plan and open road plan in some of these states aggressively. The last thing I would say to you is that, and Florida is an example, we've seen across the states an emergence of a little bit more pressure in uninsured and underinsured motorists. These claims are the slowest to emerge and have the highest ultimate severity. So this pattern has shifted, with these UM claims emerging more slowly over time, and I think our severity dynamic has tied into the emergence of some pressure with UM. So I'm not making any excuses. We are tackling hard. We're tackling with pricing. We're working the product and the segmentation as hard as ever. We've made pretty material changes to distribution management, both our targeted plans and also our agency partners. And we're working across our claim operation across the country, making sure that we're on every bit of our operating strategy. So, Mike, I expect to see brighter days ahead. I will tell you in the last 45 days, we're seeing signs of this progress. Feel very good about July. But July does not make a year, and certainly doesn't make a quarter. So we'll talk more about that in the coming quarters."

So the numbers I shared on new are more reflection of how we're moving into these territories and the customers we're seeking to add and build to our book.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. From a bottom-line perspective, second quarter results were disappointing.

From a bottom-line perspective, second quarter results were disappointing. Higher prior year development, including A&E, lower current accident year personal auto results, lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses led to a decline in our core earnings. 
However, I am pleased that our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses continued to generate solid underwriting results. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 5% over the prior year and 2% since year end. You all are aware of the challenges our industry is facing due to greater commercial lines competition, unfavorable auto loss cost trends and significantly lower interest rates. 
In Commercial Lines, competition is becoming more aggressive, especially in National Accounts and Middle Market. Some companies are expanding into new markets, while other long-standing competitors are now willing to accept lower pricing or weaker terms and conditions. Renewable rate increases are hovering near short-term loss cost trends in most lines, so expanding margins from here will be difficult. 
While we've continued to deliver good Commercial Lines results by focusing on underwriting discipline, retention and maintaining underlying margins, we see fewer opportunities to grow the top line in middle and larger account markets over the next several quarters. We will continue to pick our spots prudently.
In Personal Lines, increased vehicle miles driven as well as distracted driving have continued to put pressure on auto loss cost trends. Based on our analysis of the deterioration in frequency and severity, we strengthen reserves for accident year 2015 and increased our loss ratio estimate for accident year 2016. In hindsight, I'm disappointed we didn't recognize earlier the magnitude of the changing trends. Doug will update you on the pricing, underwriting and agency management actions we are taking to get margins back to our targets.
Personal Lines is a core business for us, and our 30-plus year relationship with AARP provides a solid foundation for long-term growth opportunities. While it will take time to fully restore profitability to target levels, I'm confident we will begin to see improved margins in this book in early 2017.
Another issue confronting our industry is the macroeconomic environment, especially the decline in interest rates, in part due to Brexit. As it relates to Brexit, I'm confident that the global insurance markets, which have been managing insurance risk freely across borders for centuries, will make the necessary changes to adapt. In the meantime, sustained low rates will continue to put pressure on net investment income and place greater emphasis on underwriting results. Our investment team has carefully steered our portfolio through many challenges over the past few years, including the European debt crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We will remain vigilant on the evolving macroeconomic environment and emerging risk.
I'd also highlight our strong risk management capabilities as our hedge programs have performed as expected in this period of heightened market volatility. 
During the quarter, we maintained our pace of capital return to shareholders, with over $430 million of share repurchases and common dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned significant capital from Talcott Resolution to the holding company, which Beth will discuss. We expect to complete our current capital management plan of 4.4 billion of common equity repurchases by the end of 2016. Later this year, we will finalize our plans for 2017.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to note that based on first half results, we now expect the 2016 Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the 93 to 94 range. This reflects favorable homeowners results year-to-date, with an approximate 5-point deterioration in the auto underlying combined ratio compared to our original outlook.  
That said, I'm confident in our approach to the current market conditions. We are taking the right steps to restore personal auto profitability, and we have the discipline to navigate the competitive Commercial Lines and Group Benefits environments. We will continue to build upon our strong franchise and invest for the future, including opportunities like the acquisition of Maxum, which is expected to close today. We will improve our operating capability and maximize efficiency while redeploying excess capital to support long-term shareholder value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified.

Commercial Lines and Group Benefits posted a solid quarter even as market headwinds have intensified. In Personal Lines, results were disappointing as loss trends in accident year 2015 continued to emerge adversely to our expectations, driving having both unfavorable prior development and a deterioration in our estimates for accident year 2016. 
Let me get right into Personal Lines, which posted a core loss of $55 million for the quarter, down from core earnings of $42 million last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 94.2, increasing 5.1 points versus last year. This is primarily due to higher auto liability loss costs, which I will discuss in a minute, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. 
Homeowners performance continues to be excellent. We experienced a slight uptick in fire-related losses, but this is compared to a very favorable second quarter 2015. 
CAT losses in the quarter were $104 million, $7 million higher than second quarter 2015, but generally in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the trends of our Homeowners book.
Included in the Personal Lines underwriting loss this quarter is $75 million pretax of adverse auto liability development primarily related to accident year 2015. The factors behind this adverse development remain consistent with those we described in the first quarter, which are related to higher employment, resulting in more people on the road. As a consequence, we're seeing both increased frequency and severity of bodily injury claims, which generally have the longest reporting lag and highest severity. Despite our first quarter reserve action, losses from the 2015 accident year emerged well above our previous expectations during the second quarter.
Due to the deterioration in these trends for the 2015 accident year, we also raised our 2016 accident year auto liability loss estimates, essentially carrying forward the 2015 experience. Based on our latest call, we do not expect to achieve the full year Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92 that we provided in February. This included homeowners of 77 to 79 and auto at 96 to 98. As I noted earlier, Homeowners results have been strong, coming in favorable to our expectations. Auto, on the other hand, is running approximately 5 points adverse to our full year expectations. We now expect the Personal Lines underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 93 to 94. This incorporates our view that the rate of change in auto frequency will moderate for the second half of this year based on the elevated levels that began in the second half of 2015, and that the rate of change in auto severity will continue to hover in the low single-digit range. 
The actions we described last quarter to address the adverse auto liability trends are intensifying. These include a substantial increase in the number of rate filings versus prior year; aggressive non-rate actions to improve our profitability, such as terminating unproductive agency relationships, de-authorizing certain agents from the AARP program, enrolling out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. On the direct side, our marketing efforts are targeted toward preferred customer segments, and we continue to address underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. 
Our 2016 rate actions continue to accelerate, equating to over 200 million of premium on the auto line. The earned premium impact of this rate will follow and, ultimately, is based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in 2017.
As a result of our profit improvement steps, AARP Direct and AARP Agency written premium was up only modestly at 1% and 3%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Other agency was down 17%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix towards AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. 
When I step back and reflect on the first quarter of 2016 for Personal Lines, there's no hiding our disappointment in the results. However, encouraging signs are emerging from our various auto initiatives, and I'm confident that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Now let's shift over to Commercial Lines, where we had a solid quarter with core earnings of $224 million, down $40 million from second quarter 2015. The combined ratio was 95, an increase of 2.8 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher CAT losses and lower current accident year margins in Small Commercial and Middle Market, offset by improved margins in Specialty. Renewal written pricing and Standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to first quarter 2016. 
In Small Commercial, we had another excellent quarter, with strong retentions and margins. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9 was 1.8 points higher than last year. The increase is largely due to lower margins on package business, resulting from higher non-catastrophe property and general liability losses, offset by a modest improvement in workers' compensation margins. Recall that property losses were very low a year ago, making this quarter a tough comparison. 
Small Commercial written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention, while new business was off 1% as competitive conditions intensified. We continue to advance our capabilities with initiatives in distribution, product, digital technology and analytics, all of which are crucial in the small commercial market and are helping us maintain our leadership position despite the increasing competition. 
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 91.9, up 2.6 points from second quarter 2015. This was primarily due to less favorable property losses and an increase in expenses. Similar to Small Commercial, second quarter 2015 benefited from particularly favorable property losses. Middle Market written premium in the quarter was flat compared to prior year. New business of $124 million increased $5 million over last year, due mainly to solid performance in our industry verticals, which we have been building in recent years as part of our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player. In other areas of Middle Market, we experienced a slight decline in both retention and new business for the quarter. This is the result of our disciplined pricing and underwriting stance in the market, with our primary objective centered on maintaining profitability.
Specialty Commercial had a very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4 improved 3.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins in National Accounts and the continued favorable margins in bond and financial products. Specialty Commercial premium was down 2% compared to second quarter '15, reflecting the competitive environment in National Accounts. I'm very pleased with how we're navigating these markets and the pricing discipline we continue to exhibit. 
I've described the marketplace for both Middle Market and National Accounts as increasingly aggressive, particularly for new business. We're seeing relative newcomers, some reemerging incumbents as well as the traditional players offering very competitive pricing. Although we continue to win new business and renew existing accounts at pricing that's both competitive and profitable, we expect that achieving total written premium growth in the near term will be challenging. 
Moving on to Group Benefits. Although core earnings is down from last year, the business continues to perform well and is operating from a strong market position with solid returns. Second quarter 2016 core earnings of $46 million was down $10 million, producing a core earnings margin of 5.1%. The decline in core earnings was driven primarily by lower net investment income and higher group life mortality claims. 
The group life loss ratio increased 1.9 points to 78.1 for second quarter 2016. This was primarily due to higher claims severity, which can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. 
Mortality trends remain in line with our expectations.
On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $80 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over second quarter 2015. We feel competitor pressures in this business, too, particularly in long-term disability, but had strong sales this quarter due to a large new account.
In summary, our Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses are operating effectively in competitive market conditions, and we remain focused on business retention and margins. Consistent with our philosophy across the enterprise, we are diligently pricing and underwriting, prepared to pass on the business that does not meet our return thresholds. 
In Personal Lines, we have hit a difficult stretch, but are taking numerous actions to address elevated loss cost and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. 
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study",1259,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to covered the Other segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over for questions. 
This quarter, in P&C Other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study. As a result of this study, we added $197 million before tax asbestos reserves and $71 million before tax to environmental reserves. The increase in the asbestos reserves was due to mesothelioma claims not decreasing, as expected, over the past year for a small subset of peripheral defendants in adverse jurisdictions. The environmental charge reflects higher claim severity, including for additional properties tendered during settlement discussion and increased legal defense and cleanup costs. After tax, the A&E development increased $40 million from second quarter 2015, resulting in core losses for the segment of $154 million compared with $113 million in second quarter 2015. 
We are disappointed with the development on this book. And as we have said before, we continue to evaluate options for these exposures, taking into account factors such as the value we add by managing these claims ourselves, the loss of investment income versus the cost of a transaction, as well as whether it is a partial or permanent transfer of risk. 
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a definitive agreement to sell our U.K. run-off P&C book to Catalina. This agreement provides for a permanent transfer of these liabilities and is not expected to have a material impact on our financials. 
Mutual Funds core earnings were down $2 million from second quarter 2015 due to lower fees as a result of lower assets under management. Total AUM was down about 4% from a year ago, consisting of a 2% decline in Mutual Fund AUM, principally due to lower market values over the past 12 months; and a 15% decline in Talcott variable annuity AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. 
Fund performance remains solid, with 62% of all funds and 70% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years.
Mutual Fund net flows were a negative $419 million as positive net flows in multi-strategy investments were more than offset by negative flows in equity and fixed income.  Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $107 million.
Talcott's core earnings declined to $91 million, from $171 million in second quarter of 2015, which included a $48 million tax benefit in higher limited partnership income. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, full surrender activity increased slightly to 7.7% for variable annuities and to 5.1% for fixed annuities. Surrender activity in the quarter reflects normal run-off as there are no current contract holder initiative. VA surrender activity decreased from second quarter 2015, reflecting the age of the block and is largely consistent with our assumptions. 
We recently received approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance for the $250 million extraordinary dividend that we had expected from Talcott in the second half of 2016, and this amount was received by the holding company in July. Combined with the $500 million we received in January, Talcott has provided $750 million of capital to the holding company during 2016, as planned. 
We continue to evaluate Talcott's capital generation outlook for 2016, which has been negatively impacted by lower interest rates.  As you may recall, we had a 2016 outlook for $200 million to $300 million of capital generation, which was dependent on markets and the run-off of the book, among other things. Compared to the beginning of the year, equity markets remain high, which supports fee income and earnings. However, as interest rates remain at current levels, we would most likely need to record additional cash flow testing reserves at year-end, which would reduce or eliminate 2016 capital generation at Talcott. While we have a ways to go until year end and a lot of things can change, this will be a factor for us to consider as we determine dividends for Talcott in 2017. 
I want to emphasize that even at current interest rates, Talcott's base case capital margin remains very strong, and its stress scenario capital margin, while lower than what we calculated in February, is still above our minimum. In short, the low interest rate averment has not changed Talcott's ability to remain capital self-sufficient in a stress scenario.
Turning to investments. Our limited partnership returns totaled $40 million in the second quarter, which is in line with our 6% annualized outlook. All 3 asset classes had positive returns this quarter as contrasted with first quarter 2016 losses and hedge funds in real estate. However, compared with second quarter 2015, limited partnership income was down 57% year-over-year. In second quarter last year, we had especially strong returns in real estate and private equity, resulting in a very difficult comparison.
Excluding limited partnerships, our before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, relatively consistent with the last year. However, we expect the portfolio yield and net investment income to decrease as new money yields remain below the book yields.
While our current projections for full year P&C net investment income, excluding partnerships, is still in line with our original outlook, the P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership, declined this quarter to 3.8% from 3.9% in second quarter 2015. In addition, year-to-date results include some make-whole premiums and other nonroutine items that to the extent they do not continue at the same levels, will put additional pressure on second half 2016 and full year 2017 net investment income and portfolio yields. 
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter, with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $7 million before tax. 
To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.31, down 66% from second quarter 2015. Excluding prior year development and other items listed on the segment results table in the news release, results were down about $0.15 per share, or 15%, due to higher catastrophe losses and current accident year personal auto results.
Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 5.5% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends, over the last 12 months of 7.4% versus our target of 9% over time. The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott but including the A&E charge, was 8.9%, while P&C core earnings ROE, which also includes the A&E charge, was 10.3%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of common equity. During July, we have repurchased 2 million shares for $89 million, leaving $541 million under -- remaining under the authorization. As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year.
To conclude, this quarter's results were disappointing, largely due to personal auto. As Doug discussed, we have many initiatives under way to improve Personal Lines margins, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
Aside from Personal Lines, underwriting -- underlying results in the other segments remain strong. In addition, we were pleased to see limited partnership returns back up to our 6% outlook after 3 quarters of low returns. 
While the environment remains challenging, we continue to generate capital and effectively manage the run-off of Talcott. As Chris mentioned, we expect to complete our current capital management plans by year-end and will finalize our capital management plans for 2017 by year-end.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

I would say this, number one, our physical damage frequency estimates at year-end for accident year '15 are still holding. So the number of collisions we predicted for that accident year book still look very solid. Didn't change much in the first quarter and have not changed in the second quarter. Second piece, which we talked quite a bit in the first quarter and also have developed in the second quarter, the number of bodies that are injured in those crashes during accident year '15, we're seeing more people injured and we're seeing more coverages influence. So the frequency of components of loss has grown in our 2000 -- accident year '15 book. And the third piece, which ties into that last statement, our bodily injury severity across the book has had pressure, and that pressure was evident in the first quarter if we look back on '15. And we've seen another 1 to 1.5 point of pressure in the second quarter. So that really forms the basis for why the changes. We are disappointed that we didn't see all of it, but we've gone back. And it's not like we missed the number of actions in our book. We look -- we are missing the features around them and have made pretty significant changes to make sure not only are we on top of '15, but we've adjusted for '16 moving ahead."

What I was referring to is that when we look at surplus generation in Talcott for 2016 with the potential to have the need to increase cash flow testing reserves at the end of the year, that surplus generation of $200 million to $300 million we could see decrease or be eliminated. I do expect that we will have dividends from Talcott in 2017. What the amount of dividend will be, will be dependent on kind of where we end the year at. As we look at our stress scenarios, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital that we have, and we have updated those scenarios for a steeper decline in interest rates. So when we did those scenarios at year-end, we were assuming that the 10-year at the end of '17 would be at 1.61%. And now, when we stress that, we're looking at a 10-year of 1.15%. And so with that, our stress margin capital that we shared with you in December would come down and probably be slightly under $1 billion. But I think that still gives us capacity in 2017 to take dividends from Talcott."

But when I look at the supplement and look at rate-taking activity there, it looks like you've gone from 5% before anything manifested to about 7% now. So I'd like to square that to your comment about significant rate taking. But your policy count retention is flat and new business has come off modestly. So I'm just trying to square all of those things. Like how is it that with everything that's taken place, that we're not seeing the foot come off the gas entirely? Why is new -- why is there any new business? And why isn't retention coming down further?"

But I think with that, it's important just to set the stage, right? Over the last couple of years, starting in April of '14, we started rolling out a new class plan designed to improve our competitiveness, particularly in under-penetrated segments. We also expanded our agency distribution around that, appointing some firms, which had no prior relationships with us. And those changes were going on at a time when the industry was starting to lean into higher frequency and some severity news. So probably not the best time to be rolling out a new class plan. I want to give you some evidence of what we've been working on. The last state in that class plan was rolled out in August of last year, August of '15. That was Florida. We now have the third fine-tuning or iteration of those class plans going into effect across the country. So we've been tuning those plans over this 2-year period. We're also leaning into rates. So our achievement of rate today is greater than we expected the plan to need 6 months ago. And I would say that we're leaning in harder the second half of the year, subject to our work with the various states. So the disappointment is we've leaned into a growth mode over the last couple of years at a very difficult time. Further, some of that growth was more pronounced in several states with higher overall loss costs, such as Florida. When you think about Florida, we've get a lot of retirees in certain pockets of the country. Florida, at times, can be one of the more challenging environments, and so we've had to go back and adjust our rate plan and open road plan in some of these states aggressively. The last thing I would say to you is that, and Florida is an example, we've seen across the states an emergence of a little bit more pressure in uninsured and underinsured motorists. These claims are the slowest to emerge and have the highest ultimate severity. So this pattern has shifted, with these UM claims emerging more slowly over time, and I think our severity dynamic has tied into the emergence of some pressure with UM. So I'm not making any excuses. We are tackling hard. We're tackling with pricing. We're working the product and the segmentation as hard as ever. We've made pretty material changes to distribution management, both our targeted plans and also our agency partners. And we're working across our claim operation across the country, making sure that we're on every bit of our operating strategy. So, Mike, I expect to see brighter days ahead. I will tell you in the last 45 days, we're seeing signs of this progress. Feel very good about July. But July does not make a year, and certainly doesn't make a quarter. So we'll talk more about that in the coming quarters."

So the numbers I shared on new are more reflection of how we're moving into these territories and the customers we're seeking to add and build to our book. But the retention strategies are tied into a rate adequacy, and in some places, we're very rate-adequate, and other places need a lot of work. And the numbers you're looking at are averages.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our overall third quarter results. In Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins while being disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we've been taking to improve personal auto performance.
In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong. And last evening, we announced the board authorized a new 1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend.
Starting with Personal Lines. We are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We're implementing a range of initiatives, including aggressive rate actions, that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class [ph] plant, more focused marketing and the termination of unprofitable agency relationships.
I have deep confidence in the Personal Lines leadership team and in our strategy to improve performance. 
Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book.
In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very strong at 90.0. This [ph] represents a full point improvement over the prior year. I am pleased with our competitive positioning across Commercial Lines and with our ability to defend the margins we've worked so hard to achieve.  The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets.
In Small Commercial, we're generating new business growth at very attractive returns. For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying combined ratio was 86.8. The Small Commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first-time initiatives. But Hartford has been the leader in this space. We've been investing in Small Commercial for over 3 decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's gold standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches through customer experience, digital and the use of data [ph] analytics, all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers.  We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. 
Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market, such as Middle Market and National Accounts, remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective top line growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base.
In Middle Market, retentions remain strong as we work to retain our best accounts and our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than a 0.5 point over prior year. New business, however, declined 15%, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline.
Outside of our P&C businesses, Group Benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin, an [ph] improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace.
At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations, while Mutual Funds posted another solid quarter. And third quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions.
We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July, and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends and broadening our Commercial Lines risk capabilities. 
We also expanded the Mutual Funds platform. We entered into smart beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroders.
I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations, what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewal business, along with their trust and confidence.  And they like the fact that we're becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging feedback [ph] from our partners whom [ph] share my confidence in The Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization.
As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Overall, this was a solid quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses.

Overall, this was a solid quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both Commercial Lines and Group Benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines, there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, Personal Lines posted core earnings of $25 million, up $8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 96.1, increasing 0.5 point from last year.  This is primarily the result of higher auto loss -- liability loss cost, partially offset by a decrease in expenses.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $37 million, down $31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses.  The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date, performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution.
In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends, partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2015 accident year development which we recorded in the first half of this year.  For the 2016 accident quarter, frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to begin earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters.
We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics, and given persistent trends, we're moving aggressively on multiple fronts. For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly $240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business.  This is $30 million [ph] higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015.
We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018.
New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market.  In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and Other Agency auto was down 45%.  We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational costs and reduced commissions, which contributed to a 3-point improvement in the expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016.  Other Agency was down 20%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered [ph] agents.  Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates.
The revised 2016 full year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016, based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015.  Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total Personal Lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter.
Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows everyday that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Shifting over to Commercial Lines. We had a strong quarter with core earnings of $247 million up $31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improved 6/10 of a point [ph] versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
Worker's compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business. Our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely, remaining vigilant on pricing and loss cost trends. Commercial auto, on the other hand, continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing loss cost increases.  We also recorded $18 million [ph] pretax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial in accident year 2015.
Auto is a relatively small line for us, representing approximately 10% of commercial P&C premium.  We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continue to take aggressive underwriting actions. 
The Commercial Lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter, improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. I'm especially pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines at 2% for the quarter, essentially stable over the past 5 quarters.
To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our frontline teams. 
Our strong performance in Small Commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent results on both the top and bottom line.  The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition, which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 2/10 of a point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in worker's compensation and a lower expense ratio, offset by deterioration in auto and package [ph] results. 
Written premium in Small Commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth.
Retentions continue to be strong, and new business, excluding Maxum, was up 5% to $135 million [ph] as we continue to execute in a very competitive market.
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1, improving 7/10 of a point [ph] from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers compensation margins and lower expenses, partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience.
Middle Market written premium in the quarter was down 7/10 of a point compared to prior year. New business of $99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions.
Specialty Commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins across National Accounts, bond and financial products.
Specialty Commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years, the written premium is affected by auto premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly in Specialty Commercial, driven by solid new business in National Accounts.
We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results.
In Group Benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of $51 million, up $4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%.
The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses, partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values.
We have experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold at [ph] 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales are $61 million for the quarter, flat to third quarter 2015.
We continue to feel competitor pressures particularly in long-term disability. As with our property and casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting, successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities.
In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits delivered strong results, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions.
In Personal Lines, we're pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated loss trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto.
And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to The Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace. And I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."
341546,403368041,1065036,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over to questions.Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in in",1136,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over to questions.
Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in Mutual Fund AUM, which is partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflect the continued shift to lower fee mutual funds, consistent with industry trends. Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of [indiscernible] at smart data exchange traded funds to our portfolio lineup. This is a fast-growing market with positive net flows and [indiscernible] is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future. In addition, last week, we added a new sub-advisor relationship with the adoption of 10 mutual funds managed by [indiscernible] investment management with about $3 billion in AUM. These funds, which have been rebranded as The Hartford [indiscernible] fund broadened our platform and expand our offerings, particularly in international and emerging-market.
Talcott continues to perform well, focused on running off the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by $3 million compared with third quarter of 2015 but we're well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships both from the improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns.
Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott's core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continue to runoff, offset in large part by reduced expenses.
This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities.
Talcott's adopt unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to variable annuity lapsed and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing off the remaining debt on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity debt write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment resulting in lower expected gross profits on the book.
As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a $250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company, completing our expected $750 million dividend plan for 2016.
In 2017, we expect to request dividend in the range of $500 million to $600 million. Investment results were strong this quarter with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnership investment income totaled $93 million before tax this quarter compared to $22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015.
This quarter's annualized investment returns for LPs was about 15%, which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership returns back up to 7%.
Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015 and private equity income was exceptionally strong, including a significant valuation write-off from one of the partnerships this quarter.
Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rate and lower income from nonroutine items.
Given the low level of current interest rates, we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017.
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $14 million before tax, down from $39 million in third quarter 2015.
In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses, including intend-to-sell impairments on some floating-rate and noninvestment-grade securities, including some energy-related exposures.
To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior development and limited partnerships, core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 per share.
Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third quarter 2015 with no major hurricane losses in either period. For hurricane Matthew, which was a fourth quarter event, we currently estimate losses of $40 million to $60 million before tax, which would consume a large portion, if not all, of our fourth quarter CAT budget of $60 million before tax.
The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 9.1%, and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first 6 months of 2016.
Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 6% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends, over the past 12 months of 8.4%.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million leaving approximately $195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion.
Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion, and is effective October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share.
As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratio have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repaid $275 million of maturing debt, consistent with our previously announced plan.
In 2017, we intend to repay $416 million of Senior Notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. Our 2017 capital plan was developed at the expectation that 2017 dividend and holding company cash flows, in total, would be about at the same level as in 2016.
While Talcott dividends will be $500 million to $600 million, which is down from the $750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources.
To conclude, this quarter's results were strong and as Doug discussed, our profitability improvement initiatives for personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and we are growing profitably in Small Commercial, our top-performing business.
Finally, with disciplined execution, year-to-date investment results remain very good and along with generally favorable equity market levels have helped Talcott delivered good bottom-line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we are very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

As we think about 2017, we'll share more when we get to January. But I'll say this, let's [indiscernible] like we're in an environment where lost trends don't look like averages over the past 10 years.

So I hope to see a different [indiscernible] but we'll work hard at that. The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and, hopefully, heard in my script, we've worked hard on the rate change activity and many of you that have looked inside the State filings have seen the advancement of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter, that's evidence of really what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show 9 points of pricing activity. That is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends."

So our lands into '17, '18 has changed over the last couple of quarters as has our approach to rate change. So they're directly correlated. It's the reason we're ramping up. It's the reason that our rate activity in '16 is 2x what it was in '15, but Mike, I would say that we're willing to be mobile and agile and adjust to what we see going forward.

I mean really report that block in the runoff 5 years ago really with the idea of reducing risk and policy over liabilities over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last 5 years, it's played out exactly as we would have wanted. The book is the liability side of the book had been reduced over 50% and Talcott's provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage in the most efficient great. So as we look forward, we're perfectly comfortable in running this off over a longer period of time, but myself, Beth, and we've always said we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent and that usually, in our vernacular, means a legal entity sale. So I think in the future, we'll always going to be prudent in exploring opportunities but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean 1 way or another, at this point in time.

If you go back to the comments that I made in July when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect, before consideration of the dividend, that we took out during the course of 2016, that our necessary surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even though through, the 9 months, we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends. We'd expect most, if not all of that to go away as we go towards the end of the year. So when I think about the capital that we're taking out next year, it's really looking at what access do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the level that would mean that we're running Talcott out. And based on that, feel very comfortable with the range of $500 million to $600 million. As far as the timing over the course of '17, we haven't landed specifically on that, but I would expect that we would, again not take it all out at once. Probably take some out in the first part of the year and some of the second, but that trend is still to be determined."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our overall third quarter results. In Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins while being disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we've been taking to improve personal auto performance.
In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong. And last evening, we announced the board authorized a new 1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend.
Starting with Personal Lines. We are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We're implementing a range of initiatives, including aggressive rate actions, that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class plan more focused marketing and the termination of unprofitable agency relationships.
I have deep confidence in the Personal Lines leadership team and in our strategy to improve performance. 
Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book.
In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very strong at 90.0. This represents a full point improvement over the prior year. I am pleased with our competitive positioning across Commercial Lines and with our ability to defend the margins we've worked so hard to achieve.  The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets.
In Small Commercial, we're generating new business growth at very attractive returns. For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying combined ratio was 86.8. The Small Commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first-time initiatives. But Hartford has been the leader in this space. We've been investing in Small Commercial for over 3 decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's gold standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches through customer experience, digital and the use of data analytics, all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers.  We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. 
Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market, such as Middle Market and National Accounts, remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective top line growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base.
In Middle Market, retentions remain strong as we work to retain our best accounts and our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than a 0.5 point over prior year. New business, however, declined 15%, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline.
Outside of our P&C businesses, Group Benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin and improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace.
At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations, while Mutual Funds posted another solid quarter. And third quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions.
We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July, and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends and broadening our Commercial Lines risk capabilities. 
We also expanded the Mutual Funds platform. We entered into smart beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroders.
I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations, what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewal business, along with their trust and confidence.  And they like the fact that we're becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging feedback from our partners whom share my confidence in The Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization.
As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Overall, this was a solid quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both Commercial Lines and Group Benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines, there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, Personal Lines posted core earnings of $25 million, up $8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 96.1, increasing 0.5 point from last year.  This is primarily the result of higher auto loss -- liability loss cost, partially offset by a decrease in expenses.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $37 million, down $31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses.  The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date, performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution.
In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends, partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2015 accident year development which we recorded in the first half of this year.  For the 2016 accident quarter, frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to begin earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters.
We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics, and given persistent trends, we're moving aggressively on multiple fronts. For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly $240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business.  This is $30 million higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015.
We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018.
New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market.  In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and Other Agency auto was down 45%.  We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational costs and reduced commissions, which contributed to a 3-point improvement in the expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016.  Other Agency was down 20%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents.  Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates.
The revised 2016 full year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016, based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015.  Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total Personal Lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter.
Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows everyday that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Shifting over to Commercial Lines. We had a strong quarter with core earnings of $247 million up $31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improved 0.6 point versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
Workers' compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business. Our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely, remaining vigilant on pricing and loss cost trends. Commercial auto, on the other hand, continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing loss cost increases.  We also recorded $18 million pretax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial in accident year 2015.
Auto is a relatively small line for us, representing approximately 10% of commercial P&C premium.  We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continue to take aggressive underwriting actions. 
The Commercial Lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter, improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. I'm especially pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines at 2% for the quarter, essentially stable over the past 5 quarters.
To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our frontline teams. 
Our strong performance in Small Commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent results on both the top and bottom line.  The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition, which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 0.2 point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in workers' compensation and a lower expense ratio, offset by deterioration in auto and package results. 
Written premium in Small Commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth.
Retentions continue to be strong, and new business, excluding Maxum, was up 5% to $135 million as we continue to execute in a very competitive market.
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1, improving 0.7 point from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers' compensation margins and lower expenses, partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience.
Middle Market written premium in the quarter was down 0.7 point compared to prior year. New business of $99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions.
Specialty Commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins across National Accounts, bond and financial products.
Specialty Commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years, the written premium is affected by auto premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly in Specialty Commercial, driven by solid new business in National Accounts.
We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results.
In Group Benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of $51 million, up $4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%.  The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses, partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values.  We've experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. 
Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around at 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $61 million for the quarter, flat to third quarter 2015.  We continue to feel competitive pressures, particularly in long-term disability. 
As with our Property & Casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting, successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities.
In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits delivered strong results, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions.
In Personal Lines, we're pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated loss trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto.
And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to The Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace. And I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over to questions.Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in in",1137,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over to questions.
Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in Mutual Fund AUM, which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflect the continued shift to lower fee Mutual Funds, consistent with industry trends. 
Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of Lattice adds smart beta exchange traded funds to our portfolio lineup. This is a fast-growing market with positive net flows, and Lattice is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future. 
In addition, last week, we added a new sub-advisor relationship with the adoption of 10 mutual funds managed by Schroder Investment Management with about $3 billion in AUM. These funds, which have been re-branded as The Hartford-Schroders funds, broaden our platform and expand our offerings, particularly in international and emerging markets.
Talcott continues to perform well, focused on running off the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by $3 million compared with third quarter 2015, but we're well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships both from improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns.  Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott's core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continue to run off, offset in large part by reduced expenses.
This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities.
Talcott's DAC unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to a variable annuity lapse and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing off the remaining DAC on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity DAC write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment, resulting in lower expected gross profits on the book.  As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a $250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company, completing our expected $750 million dividend plan for 2016.  In 2017, we expect to request dividends in the range of $500 million to $600 million. 
Investment results were strong this quarter, with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnership investment income totaled $93 million before tax this quarter compared to $22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015.  This quarter's annualized investment return for LPs was about 15%, which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership return back up to 7%.
Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015, and private equity income was exceptionally strong, including a significant valuation write-off for one of the partnerships this quarter.
Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rates and lower income from nonroutine items.  Given the low level of current interest rates, we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017.
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $14 million before tax, down from $39 million in third quarter 2015.
In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments on some floating rate and non-investment-grade securities, including some energy-related exposures.
To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior development and limited partnerships, core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 per share.  
Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third quarter 2015, with no major hurricane losses in either period. For Hurricane Matthew, which was a fourth quarter event, we currently estimate losses of $40 million to $60 million before tax, which would consume a large portion, if not all, of our fourth quarter CAT budget of $60 million before tax.
The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 9.1%; and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first 6 months of 2016.
Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 6% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the past 12 months, of 8.4%.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million, leaving approximately $195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion.
Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion and is effective October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share.
As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratios have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repaid $275 million of maturing debt, consistent with our previously announced plan. In 2017, we intend to repay $416 million of Senior Notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. 
Our 2017 capital plan was developed with the expectation that 2017 dividends and holding company cash flows in total will be about at the same level as in 2016.
While Talcott dividends will be $500 million to $600 million, which is down from the $750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources.
To conclude, this quarter's results were strong, and as Doug discussed, our profitability improvement initiatives for personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and we are growing profitably in Small Commercial, our top-performing business.
Finally, with disciplined execution, year-to-date investment results remain very good. And along with generally favorable equity market levels, have helped Talcott deliver good bottom line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we are very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

As we lean into fourth quarter, obviously, we'll watch those 3 months carefully. Encouraged by what we're seeing in October, but need to finish the year strong for 2016 to complete itself. As we think about 2017, we'll share more when we get to January. But I'll say this, it looks to us like we're in an environment where loss trends don't look like averages over the past 10 years. So we are anticipating an abnormal environment, hoping that it isn't as abnormal as the last 2 years have been. But we'll talk more about that with more detail in January."

So yes, we did some things in the third quarter that were a bit outsized compared to our run rate. So yes, you need to step that back to get a more normal run rate going forward. But we're continuing to match our pricing adequacy, our view about profitability with our marketing strategies, and they're incredibly correlated. So we'll continue to do that quarter-by-quarter. This is an approach that we are keenly focused on margins and the margins have to be in line for us to be kind of ramping up our marketing efforts. So I hope to see a different day soon, but we'll work hard at that. The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and, hopefully, heard in my script, we've worked hard on the rate change activity. And many of you that have looked inside the State filings have seen the advancement of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter. That's evidence of, really, what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show 9 points of pricing activity. That is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends."

So our lens into '17, '18 has changed a bit over the last couple of quarters, as has our approach to rate change. So they're directly correlated. It's the reason we're ramping up.

I think you know the stock answer, we're not going to comment upon rumors or speculation. So -- but I could share with you maybe just a framework that probably many of you have heard over the years in what our sort of strategy and goals with Talcott were. I mean really, we put that block in the runoff 5 years ago, really, with the idea of reducing risk and policyholder liabilities over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last 5 years, it's played out exactly as we would've wanted. The book is -- the liability side of the book has been reduced to over 50% and Talcott's provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage in the most efficient way. So as we look forward, we're perfectly comfortable in running this off over a longer period of time. But myself, Beth, we've always said, we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent, and that usually, in our vernacular, means a legal entity sale. So I think in the future, we'll always be prudent in exploring opportunities but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean, one way or another, at this point in time. I mean, it's running off, as we planned and if there are solutions out there that make economic sense for us, that would be acceptable to regulators, that take care of our customers and employees, we would explore that."

So a couple of things. I mean, it's hard to parse out an exact number. If you go back to the comments that I made in July when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect, before consideration of the dividend that we took out during the course of 2016, that our statutory surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even though through the 9 months we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends, we'd expect most, if not all of that, to go away as we go towards the end of the year. So when I think about the capital that we're taking out next year, it's really looking at what excess do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the level that, that would mean that we're running Talcott at, and based on that, feel very comfortable with the range of $500 million to $600 million. As far as the timing over the course of '17, we haven't landed specifically on that, but I would expect that we would, again, not take it all out at once. Probably take some out in the first part of the year and some in the second, but that timing is still to be determined."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our overall third quarter results. In Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins while being disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we've been taking to improve personal auto performance.
In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong. And last evening, we announced the board authorized a new 1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend.
Starting with Personal Lines. We are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We're implementing a range of initiatives, including aggressive rate actions that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class plan, more focused marketing and the termination of unprofitable agency relationships.
I have deep confidence in the Personal Lines leadership team and in their strategy to improve performance. 
Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book.
In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very strong at 90.0. This represents a full point improvement over the prior year. I am pleased with our competitive positioning across Commercial Lines and with our ability to defend the margins we've worked so hard to achieve.  The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets.
In Small Commercial, we're generating new business growth at very attractive returns. For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying combined ratio was 86.8. The Small Commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first-time initiatives. But Hartford has been the leader in this space. We've been investing in Small Commercial for over 3 decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's gold standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches to customer experience, digital and the use of data analytics, all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers.  We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. 
Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market, such as Middle Market and National Accounts, remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective top line growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base.
In Middle Market, retentions remain strong as we work to retain our best accounts and our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than a 0.5 point over prior year. New business, however, declined 15%, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline.
Outside of our P&C businesses, Group Benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin and improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace.
At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations, while Mutual Funds posted another solid quarter. And third quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions.
We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July, and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends and broadening our Commercial Lines risk capabilities. 
We also expanded the Mutual Funds platform. We entered into smart beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroders.
I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations, what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewal business, along with their trust and confidence.  And they like the fact that we're becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging feedback from our partners whom share my confidence in The Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization.
As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Overall, this was a solid quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both Commercial Lines and Group Benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines, there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction, even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, Personal Lines posted core earnings of $25 million, up $8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 96.1, increasing 0.5 point from last year.  This is primarily the result of higher auto loss -- liability loss cost, partially offset by a decrease in expenses.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $37 million, down $31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses.  The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date, performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution.
In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends, partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2015 accident year development, which we recorded in the first half of this year.  For the 2016 accident quarter, frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to begin earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters.
We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics, and given persistent trends, we're moving aggressively on multiple fronts. For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly $240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business.  This is $30 million higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015.
We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018.
New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market.  In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and Other Agency auto was down 45%.  We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational costs and reduced commissions, which contributed to a 3-point improvement in the expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016.  Other Agency was down 20%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents.  Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates.
The revised 2016 full year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016, based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015.  Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total Personal Lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter.
Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows everyday that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Shifting over to Commercial Lines. We had a strong quarter with core earnings of $247 million up $31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improved 0.6 point versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
Workers' compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business. Our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely, remaining vigilant on pricing and loss cost trends. Commercial auto, on the other hand, continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing loss cost increases.  We also recorded $18 million pretax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial in accident year 2015.
Auto is a relatively small line for us, representing approximately 10% of commercial P&C premium.  We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continue to take aggressive underwriting actions. 
The Commercial Lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter, improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. I'm especially pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines at 2% for the quarter, essentially stable over the past 5 quarters.
To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our frontline teams. 
Our strong performance in Small Commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent results on both the top and bottom line.  The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition, which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 0.2 point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in workers' compensation and a lower expense ratio, offset by deterioration in auto and package results. 
Written premium in Small Commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth.
Retentions continue to be strong, and new business, excluding Maxum, was up 5% to $135 million as we continue to execute in a very competitive market.
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1, improving 0.7 point from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers' compensation margins and lower expenses, partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience.
Middle Market written premium in the quarter was down 0.7 point compared to prior year. New business of $99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions.
Specialty Commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins across National Accounts, bond and financial products.
Specialty Commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years, the written premium is affected by auto premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly in Specialty Commercial, driven by solid new business in National Accounts.
We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results.
In Group Benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of $51 million, up $4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%.  The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses, partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values.  We've experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. 
Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around  90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $61 million for the quarter, flat to third quarter 2015.  We continue to feel competitive pressures, particularly in long-term disability. 
As with our Property & Casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting, successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities.
In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits delivered strong results, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions.
In Personal Lines, we're pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated loss trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto.
And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to The Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace. And I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."
341546,403368041,1065683,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management, before we turn the call over to questions.Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in i",1137,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management, before we turn the call over to questions.
Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in Mutual Fund AUM, which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflect the continued shift to lower fee Mutual Funds, consistent with industry trends. 
Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of Lattice adds smart beta exchange traded funds to our portfolio lineup. This is a fast-growing market with positive net flows, and Lattice is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future. 
In addition, last week we added a new sub-advisor relationship with the adoption of 10 mutual funds managed by Schroder Investment Management with about $3 billion in AUM. These funds, which have been re-branded as The Hartford-Schroders funds, broaden our platform and expand our offerings, particularly in international and emerging markets.
Talcott continues to perform well, focused on running off the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by $3 million compared with third quarter 2015, but we're well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships, both from improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns.  Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott's core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continue to run off, offset in large part by reduced expenses.
This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities.
Talcott's DAC unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to a variable annuity lapse and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing off the remaining DAC on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity DAC write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment, resulting in lower expected gross profits on the book.  As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a $250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company, completing our expected $750 million dividend plan for 2016.  In 2017, we expect to request dividends in the range of $500 million to $600 million. 
Investment results were strong this quarter, with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnership investment income totaled $93 million before tax this quarter compared to $22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015.  This quarter's annualized investment return for LPs was about 15%, which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership return back up to 7%.
Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015, and private equity income was exceptionally strong, including a significant valuation write-off for one of the partnerships this quarter.
Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rates and lower income from nonroutine items.  Given the low level of current interest rates, we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017.
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $14 million before tax, down from $39 million in third quarter 2015.
In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments on some floating rate and non-investment-grade securities, including some energy-related exposures.
To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior development and limited partnerships, core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 per share.  
Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third quarter 2015, with no major hurricane losses in either period. For Hurricane Matthew, which was a fourth quarter event, we currently estimate losses of $40 million to $60 million before tax, which would consume a large portion, if not all, of our fourth quarter CAT budget of $60 million before tax.
The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 9.1% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first 6 months of 2016.
Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 6% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the past 12 months, of 8.4%.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million, leaving approximately $195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion.
Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion and is effective October 31, 2016,  through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share.
As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratios have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repaid $275 million of maturing debt, consistent with our previously announced plan. In 2017, we intend to repay $416 million of Senior Notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. 
Our 2017 capital plan was developed with the expectation that 2017 dividends and holding company cash flows in total will be about at the same level as in 2016.
While Talcott dividends will be $500 million to $600 million, which is down from the $750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources.
To conclude, this quarter's results were strong, and as Doug discussed, our profitability improvement initiatives for personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and we are growing profitably in Small Commercial, our top-performing business.
Finally, with disciplined execution, year-to-date investment results remain very good and along with generally favorable equity market levels have helped Talcott deliver good bottom line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we are very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

As we lean into fourth quarter, obviously, we'll watch those 3 months carefully. Encouraged by what we're seeing in October but need to finish the year strong for 2016 to complete itself. 
As we think about 2017, we'll share more when we get to January. But I'll say this, it looks to us like we're in an environment where loss trends don't look like averages over the past 10 years. So we are anticipating an abnormal environment, hoping that it isn't as abnormal as the last 2 years have been. But we'll talk more about that with more detail in January."

So yes, we did some things in the third quarter that were a bit outsized compared to our run rate. So yes, you need to step that back to get a more normal run rate going forward. But we're continuing to match our pricing adequacy, our view about profitability with our marketing strategies, and they're incredibly correlated. So we'll continue to do that quarter-by-quarter. This is an approach that we are keenly focused on margins and the margins have to be in line for us to be kind of ramping up marketing efforts. So I hope to see a different day soon, but we'll work hard at that. 
The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and, hopefully, heard in my script, we've worked hard on the rate change activity. And many of you that have looked inside the State filings have seen the advancement of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter. That's evidence of, really, what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show 9 points of pricing activity. That is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends."

So as we think about kind of this roll forward into 2017 and '18, there are going to be benefits, important benefits on both sides of that equation.

We do think it'll be a bit more tempered in '17, but at the moment, we need to see better signs across the industry that auto experience is going to demonstrate that."

How much more can we do, obviously, is a function of where we see the ability to market on a more targeted basis, state basis,  where we think there is still opportunities to acquire business at acceptable rates. So I'm not going to give you a precise formula, but I mean, it's been cut back quite substantially already. We feel good about that level, where it is right now from a run rate side, particularly as we head into '17. But if there is any additional discomfort in what we're seeing, it is a lever that we could continue to modify and pull. So if we're running pro forma about a 50% of what our historical rate's been, we still theoretically have $0.50 on those additional dollars to pull."

I think you know the stock answer: We're not going to comment upon rumors or speculation. So -- but I could share with you maybe just a framework that probably many of you have heard over the years in what our sort of strategy and goals with Talcott were. I mean really, we put that block into runoff 5 years ago, really, with the idea of reducing risk and policyholder liabilities over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last 5 years, it's played out exactly as we would've wanted. The book is -- the liability side of the book has been reduced to over 50% and Talcott's provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage -- be managed in the most efficient way. So as we look forward, we're perfectly comfortable in running this off over a longer period of time. But myself, Beth, we've always said, we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent, and that usually, in our vernacular, means a legal entity sale. 
So I think in the future, we'll always be prudent in exploring opportunities but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean, one way or another, at this point in time. I mean, it's running off, as we planned. And if there are solutions out there that make economic sense for us, that would be acceptable to regulators, that take care of our customers and employees, we would explore that."

So a couple of things. I mean, it's hard to parse out an exact number. If you go back to the comments that I made in July when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect, before consideration of the dividends that we took out during the course of 2016, that our statutory surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even though through the 9 months we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends, we'd expect most, if not all of that, to go away as we go towards the end of the year. 
So when I think about the capital that we're taking out next year, it's really looking at what excess do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the levels that, that would mean that we're running Talcott at and, based on that, feel very comfortable with the range of $500 million to $600 million. 
As far as the timing over the course of '17, we haven't landed specifically on that, but I would expect that we would, again, not take it all out at once. Probably take some out in the first part of the year and some in the second, but that timing is still to be determined."

And the majority of the sort of non-investment income return comes from the fees that are generated on the variable annuity book. And we're pretty -- they're transparent in how that is running off.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our overall third quarter results. In Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins while being disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we've been taking to improve personal auto performance.
In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong. And last evening, we announced the board authorized a new 1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend.
Starting with Personal Lines. We are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We're implementing a range of initiatives, including aggressive rate actions that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class plan, more focused marketing and the termination of unprofitable agency relationships.
I have deep confidence in the Personal Lines leadership team and in their strategy to improve performance. 
Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book.
In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very strong at 90.0. This represents a full point improvement over the prior year. I am pleased with our competitive positioning across Commercial Lines and with our ability to defend the margins we've worked so hard to achieve. The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets.
In Small Commercial, we're generating new business growth at very attractive returns. For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying combined ratio was 86.8. The Small Commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first-time initiatives. The Hartford has been the leader in this space. We've been investing in Small Commercial for over 3 decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's gold standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches to customer experience, digital and the use of data, analytics, all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers. We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. 
Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market, such as Middle Market and National Accounts, remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective top line growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base.
In Middle Market, retentions remain strong as we work to retain our best accounts and our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than a 0.5 point over prior year. New business, however, declined 15%, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline.
Outside of our P&C businesses, Group Benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin and improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace.
At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations, while Mutual Funds posted another solid quarter. And third quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions.
We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July, and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends and broadening our Commercial Lines risk capabilities. 
We also expanded the Mutual Funds platform. We entered into smart beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroders.
I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations, what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewal business, along with their trust and confidence. And they like the fact that we're becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging feedback from our partners whom share my confidence in The Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization.
As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Overall, this was a solid quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both Commercial Lines and Group Benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines, there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction, even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, Personal Lines posted core earnings of $25 million, up $8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 96.1, increasing 0.5 point from last year. This is primarily the result of higher auto loss -- liability loss cost, partially offset by a decrease in expenses.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $37 million, down $31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses. The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date, performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution.
In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends, partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2015 accident year development, which we recorded in the first half of this year. For the 2016 accident quarter, frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to begin earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters.
We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics, and given persistent trends, we're moving aggressively on multiple fronts. For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly $240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business. This is $30 million higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015.
We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018.
New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market. In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and Other Agency auto was down 45%. We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational costs and reduced commissions, which contributed to a 3-point improvement in the expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016. Other Agency was down 20%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates.
The revised 2016 full year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016, based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015. Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total Personal Lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter.
Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows every day that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Shifting over to Commercial Lines. We had a strong quarter with core earnings of $247 million up $31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improved 0.6 point versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
Workers' compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business. Our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely, remaining vigilant on pricing and loss cost trends. Commercial auto, on the other hand, continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing loss cost increases. We also recorded $18 million pretax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial in accident year 2015.
Auto is a relatively small line for us, representing approximately 10% of commercial P&C premium. We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continue to take aggressive underwriting actions. 
The Commercial Lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter, improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. I'm especially pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines at 2% for the quarter, essentially stable over the past 5 quarters.
To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our frontline teams. 
Our strong performance in Small Commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent results on both the top and bottom line. The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition, which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 0.2 point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in workers' compensation and a lower expense ratio, offset by deterioration in auto and package results. 
Written premium in Small Commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth.
Retentions continue to be strong, and new business, excluding Maxum, was up 5% to $135 million as we continue to execute in a very competitive market.
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1, improving 0.7 point from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers' compensation margins and lower expenses, partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience.
Middle Market written premium in the quarter was down 0.7 point compared to prior year. New business of $99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions.
Specialty Commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins across National Accounts, Bond and Financial Products.
Specialty Commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years, the written premium is affected by auto premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly in Specialty Commercial, driven by solid new business in National Accounts.
We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results.
In Group Benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of $51 million, up $4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses, partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values. We've experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. 
Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $61 million for the quarter, flat to third quarter 2015. We continue to feel competitive pressures, particularly in long-term disability. 
As with our Property & Casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting, successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities.
In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits delivered strong results, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions.
In Personal Lines, we're pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated loss trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto.
And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to The Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace. And I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management, before we turn the call over to questions.Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in i",1137,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management, before we turn the call over to questions.
Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in Mutual Fund AUM, which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflect the continued shift to lower fee Mutual Funds, consistent with industry trends. 
Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of Lattice adds smart beta exchange traded funds to our portfolio lineup. This is a fast-growing market with positive net flows, and Lattice is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future. 
In addition, last week we added a new sub-advisor relationship with the adoption of 10 mutual funds managed by Schroder Investment Management with about $3 billion in AUM. These funds, which have been re-branded as The Hartford-Schroders funds, broaden our platform and expand our offerings, particularly in international and emerging markets.
Talcott continues to perform well, focused on running off the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by $3 million compared with third quarter 2015, but we're well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships, both from improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns. Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott's core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continue to run off, offset in large part by reduced expenses.
This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities.
Talcott's DAC unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to a variable annuity lapse and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing off the remaining DAC on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity DAC write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment, resulting in lower expected gross profits on the book. As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a $250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company, completing our expected $750 million dividend plan for 2016. In 2017, we expect to request dividends in the range of $500 million to $600 million. 
Investment results were strong this quarter, with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnership investment income totaled $93 million before tax this quarter compared to $22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter's annualized investment return for LPs was about 15%, which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership return back up to 7%.
Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015, and private equity income was exceptionally strong, including a significant valuation write-off for one of the partnerships this quarter. Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rates and lower income from nonroutine items. Given the low level of current interest rates, we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017.
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $14 million before tax, down from $39 million in third quarter 2015.
In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments on some floating rate and non-investment-grade securities, including some energy-related exposures.
To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior development and limited partnerships, core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 per share. 
Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third quarter 2015, with no major hurricane losses in either period. For Hurricane Matthew, which was a fourth quarter event, we currently estimate losses of $40 million to $60 million before tax, which would consume a large portion, if not all, of our fourth quarter CAT budget of $60 million before tax.
The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 9.1% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first 6 months of 2016.
Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 6% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the past 12 months, of 8.4%.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million, leaving approximately $195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion.
Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion and is effective October 31, 2016, through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share.
As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratios have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repaid $275 million of maturing debt, consistent with our previously announced plan. In 2017, we intend to repay $416 million of Senior Notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. 
Our 2017 capital plan was developed with the expectation that 2017 dividends and holding company cash flows in total will be about at the same level as in 2016.
While Talcott dividends will be $500 million to $600 million, which is down from the $750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources.
To conclude, this quarter's results were strong, and as Doug discussed, our profitability improvement initiatives for personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and we are growing profitably in Small Commercial, our top-performing business.
Finally, with disciplined execution, year-to-date investment results remain very good and along with generally favorable equity market levels have helped Talcott deliver good bottom line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we are very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

So yes, we did some things in the third quarter that were a bit outsized compared to our run rate. So yes, you need to step that back to get a more normal run rate going forward. But we're continuing to match our pricing adequacy, our view about profitability with our marketing strategies, and they're incredibly correlated. So we'll continue to do that quarter-by-quarter. This is an approach that we are keenly focused on margins and the margins have to be in line for us to be kind of ramping up marketing efforts. So I hope to see a different day soon, but we'll work hard at that. The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and, hopefully, heard in my script, we've worked hard on the rate change activity. And many of you that have looked inside the State filings have seen the advancement of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter. That's evidence of, really, what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show 9 points of pricing activity. That is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends."

So as we think about kind of this roll forward into 2017 and '18, there are going to be benefits, important benefits on both sides of that equation.

You step back from that and you look at fast track data, and you see aggregate severity and frequency in this industry over the past 7, 8 quarters in a very different spot. So our lens into '17, '18 has changed a bit over the last couple of quarters, as has our approach to rate change. So they're directly correlated. It's the reason we're ramping up. It's the reason that our rate activity in '16 is 2x what it was in '15. But Mike, I would say that we are willing to be mobile and agile and adjust to what we see going forward. We do think it'll be a bit more tempered in '17, but at the moment, we need to see better signs across the industry that auto experience is going to demonstrate that."

We feel good about that level, where it is right now from a run rate side, particularly as we head into '17.

I think you know the stock answer: We're not going to comment upon rumors or speculation. So -- but I could share with you maybe just a framework that probably many of you have heard over the years in what our sort of strategy and goals with Talcott were. I mean really, we put that block into runoff 5 years ago, really, with the idea of reducing risk and policyholder liabilities over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last 5 years, it's played out exactly as we would've wanted. The book is -- the liability side of the book has been reduced to over 50% and Talcott's provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage -- be managed in the most efficient way. So as we look forward, we're perfectly comfortable in running this off over a longer period of time. But myself, Beth, we've always said, we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent, and that usually, in our vernacular, means a legal entity sale. So I think in the future, we'll always be prudent in exploring opportunities but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean, one way or another, at this point in time. I mean, it's running off, as we planned. And if there are solutions out there that make economic sense for us, that would be acceptable to regulators, that take care of our customers and employees, we would explore that."

So a couple of things. I mean, it's hard to parse out an exact number. If you go back to the comments that I made in July when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect, before consideration of the dividends that we took out during the course of 2016, that our statutory surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even though through the 9 months we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends, we'd expect most, if not all of that, to go away as we go towards the end of the year. So when I think about the capital that we're taking out next year, it's really looking at what excess do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the levels that, that would mean that we're running Talcott at and, based on that, feel very comfortable with the range of $500 million to $600 million. As far as the timing over the course of '17, we haven't landed specifically on that, but I would expect that we would, again, not take it all out at once. Probably take some out in the first part of the year and some in the second, but that timing is still to be determined."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our overall third quarter results. In Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins while being disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we've been taking to improve personal auto performance.
In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong. And last evening, we announced the board authorized a new $1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend.
Starting with Personal Lines. We are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We're implementing a range of initiatives, including aggressive rate actions that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class plan, more focused marketing and the termination of unprofitable agency relationships.
I have deep confidence in the Personal Lines leadership team and in their strategy to improve performance. 
Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book.
In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very strong at 90.0. This represents a full point improvement over the prior year. I am pleased with our competitive positioning across Commercial Lines and with our ability to defend the margins we've worked so hard to achieve. The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets.
In Small Commercial, we're generating new business growth at very attractive returns. For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying combined ratio was 86.8. The Small Commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first-time initiatives. The Hartford has been the leader in this space. We've been investing in Small Commercial for over 3 decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's gold standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches to customer experience, digital and the use of data, analytics, all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers. We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. 
Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market, such as Middle Market and National Accounts, remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective top line growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base.
In Middle Market, retentions remain strong as we work to retain our best accounts and our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than a 0.5 point over prior year. New business, however, declined 15%, reflecting pricing and underwriting discipline.
Outside of our P&C businesses, Group Benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin and improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace.
At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations, while Mutual Funds posted another solid quarter. And third quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions.
We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July, and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends and broadening our Commercial Lines risk capabilities. 
We also expanded the Mutual Funds platform. We entered into smart beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroders.
I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations, what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewal business, along with their trust and confidence. And they like the fact that we're becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging feedback from our partners whom share my confidence in The Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization.
As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug."

Overall, this was a solid quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both Commercial Lines and Group Benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines, there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction, even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, Personal Lines posted core earnings of $25 million, up $8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 96.1, increasing 0.5 point from last year. This is primarily the result of higher auto loss -- liability loss cost, partially offset by a decrease in expenses.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $37 million, down $31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses. The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date, performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution.
In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends, partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2015 accident year development, which we recorded in the first half of this year. For the 2016 accident quarter, frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to begin earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters.
We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics, and given persistent trends, we're moving aggressively on multiple fronts. For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly $240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business. This is $30 million higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015.
We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018.
New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market. In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and Other Agency auto was down 45%. We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational costs and reduced commissions, which contributed to a 3-point improvement in the expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016. Other Agency was down 20%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates.
The revised 2016 full year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016, based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015. Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total Personal Lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter.
Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows every day that we're moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.
Shifting over to Commercial Lines. We had a strong quarter with core earnings of $247 million up $31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improved 0.6 point versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
Workers' compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business. Our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely, remaining vigilant on pricing and loss cost trends. Commercial auto, on the other hand, continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing loss cost increases. We also recorded $18 million pretax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial in accident year 2015.
Auto is a relatively small line for us, representing approximately 10% of commercial P&C premium. We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continue to take aggressive underwriting actions. 
The Commercial Lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter, improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. I'm especially pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines at 2% for the quarter, essentially stable over the past 5 quarters.
To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our frontline teams. 
Our strong performance in Small Commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent results on both the top and bottom line. The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition, which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 0.2 point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in workers' compensation and a lower expense ratio, offset by deterioration in auto and package results. 
Written premium in Small Commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth.
Retentions continue to be strong, and new business, excluding Maxum, was up 5% to $135 million as we continue to execute in a very competitive market.
Moving to Middle Market. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1, improving 0.7 point from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers' compensation margins and lower expenses, partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience.
Middle Market written premium in the quarter was down 0.7 point compared to prior year. New business of $99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions.
Specialty Commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins across National Accounts, Bond and Financial Products.
Specialty Commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years, the written premium is affected by auto premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly in Specialty Commercial, driven by solid new business in National Accounts.
We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results.
In Group Benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of $51 million, up $4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses, partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values. We've experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. 
Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $61 million for the quarter, flat to third quarter 2015. We continue to feel competitive pressures, particularly in long-term disability. 
As with our Property & Casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting, successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities.
In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial Lines and Group Benefits delivered strong results, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions.
In Personal Lines, we're pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated loss trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto.
And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to The Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace. And I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth."

I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management, before we turn the call over to questions.Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in i",1137,"Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segments, the investment portfolio and capital management, before we turn the call over to questions.
Mutual Fund's core earnings were down $1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to a 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in Mutual Fund AUM, which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflect the continued shift to lower fee Mutual Funds, consistent with industry trends. 
Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of Lattice adds smart beta exchange traded funds to our portfolio lineup. This is a fast-growing market with positive net flows, and Lattice is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future. 
In addition, last week we added a new sub-advisor relationship with the adoption of 10 mutual funds managed by Schroder Investment Management with about $3 billion in AUM. These funds, which have been re-branded as The Hartford-Schroders funds, broaden our platform and expand our offerings, particularly in international and emerging markets.
Talcott continues to perform well, focused on running off the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by $3 million compared with third quarter 2015, but we're well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships, both from improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns. Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott's core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continue to run off, offset in large part by reduced expenses.
This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities.
Talcott's DAC unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to a variable annuity lapse and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing off the remaining DAC on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity DAC write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment, resulting in lower expected gross profits on the book. As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a $250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company, completing our expected $750 million dividend plan for 2016. In 2017, we expect to request dividends in the range of $500 million to $600 million. 
Investment results were strong this quarter, with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnership investment income totaled $93 million before tax this quarter compared to $22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter's annualized investment return for LPs was about 15%, which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership return back up to 7%.
Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015, and private equity income was exceptionally strong, including a significant valuation write-off for one of the partnerships this quarter. Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rates and lower income from nonroutine items. Given the low level of current interest rates, we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017.
Turning to credit performance. Our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well-diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $14 million before tax, down from $39 million in third quarter 2015.
In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments on some floating rate and non-investment-grade securities, including some energy-related exposures.
To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior development and limited partnerships, core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 per share. 
Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third quarter 2015, with no major hurricane losses in either period. For Hurricane Matthew, which was a fourth quarter event, we currently estimate losses of $40 million to $60 million before tax, which would consume a large portion, if not all, of our fourth quarter CAT budget of $60 million before tax.
The 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 9.1% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first 6 months of 2016.
Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 6% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the past 12 months, of 8.4%.
Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million, leaving approximately $195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion.
Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion and is effective October 31, 2016, through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share.
As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratios have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repaid $275 million of maturing debt, consistent with our previously announced plan. In 2017, we intend to repay $416 million of Senior Notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. 
Our 2017 capital plan was developed with the expectation that 2017 dividends and holding company cash flows in total will be about at the same level as in 2016.
While Talcott dividends will be $500 million to $600 million, which is down from the $750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources.
To conclude, this quarter's results were strong, and as Doug discussed, our profitability improvement initiatives for personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and we are growing profitably in Small Commercial, our top-performing business.
Finally, with disciplined execution, year-to-date investment results remain very good and along with generally favorable equity market levels have helped Talcott deliver good bottom line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we are very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session."

As we lean into fourth quarter, obviously, we'll watch those 3 months carefully. Encouraged by what we're seeing in October but need to finish the year strong for 2016 to complete itself. As we think about 2017, we'll share more when we get to January. But I'll say this, it looks to us like we're in an environment where loss trends don't look like averages over the past 10 years. So we are anticipating an abnormal environment, hoping that it isn't as abnormal as the last 2 years have been. But we'll talk more about that with more detail in January."

But we're continuing to match our pricing adequacy, our view about profitability with our marketing strategies, and they're incredibly correlated. So we'll continue to do that quarter-by-quarter. This is an approach that we are keenly focused on margins and the margins have to be in line for us to be kind of ramping up marketing efforts. So I hope to see a different day soon, but we'll work hard at that. The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and, hopefully, heard in my script, we've worked hard on the rate change activity. And many of you that have looked inside the State filings have seen the advancement of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter. That's evidence of, really, what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show 9 points of pricing activity. That is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends."

You step back from that and you look at fast track data, and you see aggregate severity and frequency in this industry over the past 7, 8 quarters in a very different spot. So our lens into '17, '18 has changed a bit over the last couple of quarters, as has our approach to rate change. So they're directly correlated. It's the reason we're ramping up. It's the reason that our rate activity in '16 is 2x what it was in '15. But Mike, I would say that we are willing to be mobile and agile and adjust to what we see going forward. We do think it'll be a bit more tempered in '17, but at the moment, we need to see better signs across the industry that auto experience is going to demonstrate that."

I think you know the stock answer: We're not going to comment upon rumors or speculation. So -- but I could share with you maybe just a framework that probably many of you have heard over the years in what our sort of strategy and goals with Talcott were. I mean really, we put that block into runoff 5 years ago, really, with the idea of reducing risk and policyholder liabilities over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last 5 years, it's played out exactly as we would've wanted. The book is -- the liability side of the book has been reduced to over 50% and Talcott's provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage -- be managed in the most efficient way. So as we look forward, we're perfectly comfortable in running this off over a longer period of time. But myself, Beth, we've always said, we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent, and that usually, in our vernacular, means a legal entity sale. So I think in the future, we'll always be prudent in exploring opportunities but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean, one way or another, at this point in time. I mean, it's running off, as we planned. And if there are solutions out there that make economic sense for us, that would be acceptable to regulators, that take care of our customers and employees, we would explore that."

So a couple of things. I mean, it's hard to parse out an exact number. If you go back to the comments that I made in July when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect, before consideration of the dividends that we took out during the course of 2016, that our statutory surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even though through the 9 months we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends, we'd expect most, if not all of that, to go away as we go towards the end of the year. So when I think about the capital that we're taking out next year, it's really looking at what excess do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the levels that, that would mean that we're running Talcott at and, based on that, feel very comfortable with the range of $500 million to $600 million. As far as the timing over the course of '17, we haven't landed specifically on that, but I would expect that we would, again, not take it all out at once. Probably take some out in the first part of the year and some in the second, but that timing is still to be determined."
