Welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you very much for joining us today. As reported in this morning's press release, the company achieved GAAP net income of $158 million in the fourth quarter, up from $146 million in the fourth quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.14 this year on a GAAP basis compared to $1 $0.01 in the same period a year ago, a 13% increase. As noted in our release, we had onetime items in both this just completed quarter and last year's Q4. This year, the company recorded a pretax charge of $5 million, $4 million after-tax to reflect the impairment of certain Runners Point group assets, thus, reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. A year ago, the fourth quarter included a gain from the sale of a property as well as a write-down of a trade name. Excluding these items, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.16, a 16% increase over the $1 per share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as otherwise indicated the numbers mentioned during our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results.
The strong finish to the year brought our annual non-GAAP net income to $606 million, also 16% up from a year ago and our fourth consecutive year achieving record annual earnings. On a per share basis, earnings were $4.29 for the full year, an increase of 20% over last year's $3.58. Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will lead off our call this morning with a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial performance, followed by Dick Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will touch on product trends and our progress in year 1, executing our current strategic initiatives as we work towards the long-term financial objectives outlined in last year's Investor Day. Lauren will complete our prepared remarks with an overview of our annual and quarterly expectations for 2016. Lauren?"

We do appreciate you joining us as we review our 2015 results and take a first look at 2016.

We do appreciate you joining us as we review our 2015 results and take a first look at 2016. It was indeed an outstanding year for Foot Locker, and I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, we were able to sustain the top line momentum we had built throughout the year, posting a 7.9% comparable sales gain on top of last year's 10.2% increase. 
Our international divisions had an outstanding year. In fact, total sales increased more than 10% in local currency in each of our regions. The fourth quarter was led by Foot Locker Asia Pacific with a mid-teens comparable sales gain on top of a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter last year. Close behind were Foot Locker Europe with an increase in the teens and Foot Locker Canada, which was up double digits. 
Unfortunately, our Runners Point group stores did not share in that success, but both the Runners Point and Sidestep banners down mid-single digits. This performance contributed to the impairment charge John mentioned, which had 2 components: the write-down of the assets of some underperforming stores and the impairments of the trade name SP24.com. The clearance website that Runners Point was operating when we acquired the business. We have decided to deemphasize SP24.com is not consistent with our company's overall position as retailer of premium full price athletic footwear and apparel. 
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in another strong performance with an overall comparable sales gain of 9.6%. Our domestic store banner dot-com businesses collectively increased sales more than 20%, with even faster growth outside the U.S. 
Eastbay sales declined low single digits. The true performance part of the athletic industry where Eastbay's assortments are strongest have slowed relative to casual. We also believe the strength of the U.S. dollar test some Eastbay customers shopping locally in their home markets.
The domestic divisions all posted solid sales performances with Kids Foot Locker leading the way with a high single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit total revenue increase, factoring in the addition of 13 net new kids stores during the year. Foot Locker in the U.S., Champs Sports and Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up mid-single-digits, while Footaction was up low single digits this quarter on top of the double-digit increase in Q4 last year. 
Footwear, once again, drove our sales gains, up double digits overall in the quarter. Men's footwear was up high single digits, while women's and kids footwear were both up double digits. By category, running was up into the teens, while basketball with underlying shifts that Dick will highlight in a moment was up at the low end of mid-single digits.
True apparel, meaning tops and bottoms, was up low single digits, while the smaller accessories business, including socks and hats, posted a high single-digit comp decline. Overall, sales of apparel and accessories were down just a few basis points. Similar to the other quarters of 2015 reported sales were reduced significantly in Q4 due to the impact of weak or FX rates of this year compared to rates of a year ago. Thus, our 7.9% comparable sales gain translated into a reported sales increase of 5%. Although it is early days for 2016 and we have no special insight as to where currencies are going to go, for now, we seem to have cycled through the bulk of the FX impact.
Our monthly comp cadence was highlighted by an exceptionally strong December, which was up in the teens. Comparable sales in November finished at the low end of mid-singles, and January increased at a low single-digit base. While January was running stronger than that, the Snowstorm Jonas and the slower distribution of income tax refund checks in the U.S. caused sales to tail off in the last 2 weeks.
Moving down the P&L to gross margin. We produced an excellent 70 basis point improvement to 33.6% of sales from 32.9% last year. There were 2 primary factors driving the increase. First, merchandise margin improved 50 basis points, due primarily to lower markdowns. Although the increased proportion of footwear in our sales mix also provided a margin lift. Apparel margins improved even more than footwear margins in the quarter, although they still remain below footwear.
Second, we achieved leverage of 40 basis points on a relatively fixed buyer and occupancy expenses. These 2 factors were partially offset by 20 basis points of headwind related to FX.
Our team once again did a good job managing expenses in the quarter as our selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 19.3% of sales from 19.6% of sales last year. While we were headed for a bit more SG&A leverage, the sales dynamics in the last 2 weeks of the quarter did not leave much room to adjust variable expenses. Overall, our full year SG&A expense rate improved by 80 basis points from 19.9% to an all-time low 19.1% as we continue to drive productivity.
For example, our sales per payroll hour improved in almost every division, and overall sales per gross square-foot surpassed $500 for the first time, reaching $504. Depreciation expense increased this quarter to $39 million from $33 million. For the full year, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $148 million due to the ongoing investment in the customer experience in our stores, our digital sites and various system technologies. Our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes reached a rate of 12.8% of sales, above the long-range goal of 12.5% we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year, and the first of those goals, which we have reached. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 35.4%, above last year's Q4 rate but below our expected run rate of 36.5%, due largely to the expiration of statute of limitations on foreign tax positions the company has taken in prior years. 
On the bottom line with another record quarter for our company and another record year. EPS of $1.16 in Q4 marks the third quarter this year that we achieved at least $1 per share in earnings. Adjusted net income was $606 million in 2015, a 16% increase over last year. Our net income margin was 8.2%, approaching our long-range goal of 8.5%, while return on invested capital improved to 15.8%. Unequivocally, it was another excellent performance by the entire team of Foot Locker that enabled the company to give such outstanding results. 
Full year EPS was $4.29 compared to $3.58 last year. A 20% improvement in EPS was 4% higher than the increase in net income, reflecting the significant return of cash to shareholders we executed throughout the year via our share repurchase program. For the quarter, we spent $103 million to repurchase a total of 1.64 million shares, bringing our full year to 6.7 million shares at the cost of $419 million. We also returned $139 million of cash to investors on the form of dividends during 2015, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $558 million, more than 90% of adjusted net income. 
As we announced last week, our board declared a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend payout rates to $0.275 per share. And at year-end, we have $637 million remaining on the $1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized a year ago. With a solid financial position and the history of generating significant annual cash flow, we and the board believe that the company has the ability to continue returning a substantial amount of cash directly to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our financial performance towards our long-range objectives in the years ahead.
My final comment before I hand the call over to Dick is on inventory, which remains current and increasingly productive. It increased 2.8% actual FX rate compared to a 5% sales increase. Using constant currencies, inventory was up 4.1%, in line with our standard when compared to our 8.8% total sales increase. 
I'll turn the call over to Dick now and be back in a bit to wrap up our remarks with 2016 guidance."
315394,324790739,942022,"Foot Locker, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Foot Locker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. My first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer came just about a year ago, and I recall being very pleased then to be able to report the remarkable record-breaking achievements that the team produced during 2",1714,"Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. My first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer came just about a year ago, and I recall being very pleased then to be able to report the remarkable record-breaking achievements that the team produced during 2014. And today, I could not be more proud to report that the team was able to surpass in 2015 almost every financial and operational metric from 2014. Although we know that breaking records is what is expected of a high-performing team, I must first  thank all the individual associates who made it happen. There love of the game was apparent everywhere I visited this past year from the store associates I watched engaging with customers to the various division headquarters teams working out how to win consistently with their core customer, to the support facility personnel teaming up with operations I saw that making sure everything they do helps lead to a happy customer as he or she leaves the store or one of our websites with some exciting new sneakers or apparel. All along the way, I witnessed a lot of passion for winning with our customers. In a pattern that has developed in recent years, we achieved sales gains in all regions, channels and genders in the most banners and product categories. We believe this broad-based consistent performance reflects the leadership positions we have developed as a company across our merchant and operations teams, not to mention our equally talented support functions. I'm not going to spend a lot of time going over product highlights since most of the trends of the first part of the year carried over into the fourth quarter. I will say that we made substantial progress improving the sales and productivity of all 4 legs of our product category stool: basketball, running and basketball footwear, along with apparel. As the year unfolded, I believe it became increasingly clear that we have developed a leading position in more than just basketball sneakers. A perfect example was our running business in which we delivered a mid-teen comparable sales gain in the quarter with double-digit gains in every region. This excellent performance was driven by lifestyle silhouettes such as Roshe, Huarache and Max Air from Nike and ZX Flux from adidas as we lead the market in delivering trend right running styles. Meanwhile, the rumored death of basketball where our leadership position is most widely recognized has been greatly exaggerated. Although growth in the basketball category during the quarter was modest relative to running, it was nonetheless drilled with 3 primary factors contributing: first, strength in the Jordan brand, especially in North America; second, the rise of new marquee star such as Tyree Irving at Nike and Stephen Curry at Under Armour; and third momentum in classic basketball style such as Air Force Ones. Gains in these areas were more than enough to offset the current slowdown in sales of other signature products.
We also lead the industry in sales in the wide variety of classic sneakers, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our footwear assortments. We took a strong position in the original styles such as Superstars and Stan Smiths, while also delivering popular casual styles from New Balance, PUMA and ASICS. And not least, our Timberland boot business performed exceptionally well despite the relatively mild winter weather during much of the quarter.
Let me now turn to a brief progress report on our strategic initiatives. First, our core business continued to perform very well, producing robust top and bottom growth in quarter and full year. We built on our leadership position, creating fresh and engaging store environments, having now remodeled approximately 30% of our domestic Foot Locker and Champs Sports stores and just under 20% of our Footaction stores. We also opened more than 40 shop in shops in partnership with our vendors, about half of which were House of Hoops. In 2016, we intend to continue expanding both our remodel and vendor partnership programs. Second, our kids growth pillar demonstrated outstanding progress, increasing sales well into double digits while considering sales of children's product across all of our banners. In addition to the 13 net new KFL division stores Lauren mentioned, we also had a kid's stores in Europe and in Canada, and we also added about 30 new Fly Zone shops in the U.S. in partnership with Nike. This strategy tool we plan to continue in 2016. Third, our Foot Locker business in Europe delivered a double-digit comparable sales gain in almost every country and double-digit growth across all families of business. The team there do truly exceptional job this year leading to entire market offering the hot new styles I mentioned earlier such as the various Nike modern comfort and originals line as well as Air Max of Jordan. We continue to work hard at refining and implementing our European banners segmentation strategy, and we remain fully confident that the Runners Point and Sidestep banners can contribute much more to our future success in Europe. Meanwhile, the expansion of our Kids Foot Locker banner in Europe has already proven quite successful, and we intend to build on that strength over the next several years. We made progress on our next growth apparel -- growth pillar apparel although at a somewhat slower pace than the others. Lauren mentioned that sales in the category was down slightly in the quarter. The same was true for the year, although apparel profits both in terms of rate and most importantly, dollars were up significantly.
Foot Locker Europe posted the best apparel performance with a double-digit sales increase and an improved margin rate. We're working hard with our vendors to develop special athletically inspired and fashion-right assortments, differentiated by banner to drive the level of excitement in the apparel category to be on par with the premier footwear selections our customers expect from us. We've been strengthening our team and working with our partners for some time on this and clearly, full success is not and will not come overnight. However, given how important apparel is to the vendors on growth objectives, we remain highly confident that together we will win with the customer for his or her apparel needs, too.
Our digital business had another successful quarter and year. We have invested in mobile and desktop sites as well as apps to deliver an enhanced digital experience, including more personalized interactions with our customers. As you can imagine from our young customers, mobile represents a huge part of our online traffic and a rapidly growing percent of our digital sales. Our direct-to-customer sales reached 12.7% of total sales, up from 12.1% a year ago, and our domestic footlocker.com and ladyfootlocker.com businesses were both well above the 10% target we set for dot-com sales as a percent of total banners sales. We are completely channel-neutral as a company with roughly comparable margins for both our store and direct segments, so we intend to let the customers decide what the direct-to-customer penetration rate will ultimately be rather than try to steer it one way or the other. 
Our other growth pillar is women's, and we made good progress in there, especially in footwear. The Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 division delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of comp store sales gains, and our women's footwear sales and Foot Locker and Champs Sports increased double digits for the year. We opened 15 new SIX:02 doors, bringing our total to 30. We still aren't quite to be with the performance of SIX:02, so we are slowing the store openings in 2016 as we focus on developing brand awareness, resetting the product assortments, relaunching the SIX:02 website and creating pinnacle SIX:02 experiences inside our New York City flagship stores. To oversimplify the situation a bit, we believe we have overemphasized the performance aspect of what our customers want in terms of athletically inspired apparel. It's a given that she expects the product to have performance functionality, but the SIX:02 customer really wants apparel that also has a sharp fashion edge. We are working hard with our vendors to elevate our product offerings through innovation, style and scarcity based, in many cases, on celebrity designs or endorsements such as what we're seeing with Rihanna. As in men's apparel, this is not a 1 or 2-season fix, and the vendors are highly committed to making this work. As I said, we're already making progress so we remain confident in fully commitment to delivering exceptional growth in women's footwear and apparel. 
As part of that commitment, we announced last week some key organizational changes highlighted by the promotions of Jake Jacobs to head our store business in North America and Lew Kimble to head our businesses outside North America. They've each done an exceptional job leading their respective teams and the execution of the key initiatives of our strategic plan. In addition to their promotions, we reconfigured the leadership of each of our banners under a Vice President and General Manager. We believe this structure will well position us in the global athletic marketplace, aligned with our key vendor partners and most importantly, elevate the relevance, connectivity and experiences that the customers of each of our banners expect. We separated the leadership of SIX:02, which will continue to be led by Natalie Ellis from Lady Foot Locker, which will fold into the Foot Locker U.S. banner led by Andy Gray. We have come to realize that the core customer of Lady Foot Locker is more similar to the female Foot Locker customer than she is to the SIX:02 customer, and Natalie can now focus solely on building the SIX:02 banner into the premier athletic retail destination for the more fashion forward active young woman without the added responsibility of simultaneously managing the transition of Lady Foot Locker. 
I'd like to congratulate Jake and Lou and all of the new general managers of our banners. Foot Locker's depth of talent around the globe is a tremendous strength, contributing to the high-performing company we have become. I'm very excited to see the team continue to execute our strategies and achieve even greater success in the years ahead.
With that, let me turn the call back to Lauren to give you more specifics on how we see 2016 shaping up."

We have indeed become a high-performing company, and we believe our momentum should continue in 2016. As a result, we can once again provide the same high-level guidance for 2016 that we've given in recent years. We believe we can deliver a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage earnings per share increase per share. We have planned the year with FX rates close to where they are now with the euro around $1.10 and the Canadian and Australian dollars around $0.70. The latter 2 currencies are weaker now than a year ago, so there will be a few cents of FX headwinds in 2016, but much, much less than the $0.23 of stronger dollar cost for EPS in 2015 relative to 2014 FX rates. We are planning for a slight improvement in our annual gross margin rate in the 10 to 30 basis point range, mostly driven by leverage of our buyer and occupancy cost. We do believe that we have the ongoing opportunity to take benefit of our merchandise allocation system investments and other productivity initiatives to improve bulk price selling, invest them through our merchandise margin as well. We intend to remain disciplined in managing expenses in 2016. We should also be able to lever on the fixed cost elements of SG&A to produce a modest 10 to 30 basis point rate improvement. 
We do have a Q1 headwind due to our office relocation down the block in New York City, which will add about $4 million of expense due to paying rent on both locations plus the cost of the move itself. Our lease here is up at the end of April, so after Q1, this expense will normalize. However, we could actually delever SG&A slightly in Q1. This annual SG&A guidance also incorporates all known minimum wage rate increases and changes in health care costs.
Let's talk capital expenditures for a minute. As you've seen, we've announced the $297 million program for 2016, up from the $225 million we spent last year. We intend to continue our remodel and vendor partnership programs as we elevate the customer experience across our banners. Combined with approximately 90 new stores concentrated in Europe, Kids Foot Locker in the U.S. and Footaction, we expect to spend more than $200 million on improving our store fleet in 2016. This amount includes close to $10 million to transform 2 of our New York flagship stores, 1 here in 34th Street and the other up at Times Square. 
There are some other large nonrecurring outlays included in this year's capital plan, including more than $20 million to build out our new headquarters location and a similar amount for our new online order management system and related customer experience initiative. Although we believe 2016 will represent a peak in capital expenditures, we now project spending closer to $250 million in the couple of years after this, up from the annual $225 million we mentioned in our Investor Day a year ago. With this level of capital investment in the business, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $170 million to $175 million in 2016. In addition to opening approximately 90 stores, we plan to close about 100, which will leave our store count relatively flat year-over-year. The store closures will once again be concentrated in Lady Foot Locker and Foot Locker in the U.S. 
We are planning interest expense to be fairly flat to this year's $4 million, and we are continuing to plan our effective tax rate of 36.5% in 2016. Our guidance of a double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count based on the continued execution of our share repurchase program. Although we are planning a mid-single-digit comp gain in each quarter, the profit profit flow-through challenge may be greatest in Q1, in turn creating a challenge to achieving double-digit EPS growth this quarter.
With the income tax refund shift I mentioned and the difficult compare of last year's NBA All-Star game being in New York, we're expecting February's comp to be up low single digits, and we're expecting a solid mid-single-digit comp in the remainder of the quarter. That covers the highlights of 2016. We're looking forward to another very exciting year. Let me now ask Carlos to open up the call to your questions."

February is a little bit of an anomaly, given the incredible All-Star game that we had in New York. We had a great All-Star game up in Toronto, but just based on the store coverage in the Greater New York City area and the places that we had to activate with consumers, Toronto just doesn't have that sort of store base for us. So as we look at Q1 and on into Q2 and the Olympics will be really heating up, we've got the Euro championships going on as well, so a lot of excitement around sport, which elevates all of the product offerings and the excitement with the consumer. So the ability to drive those comp gains, Lauren talked a lot about the productivity tools that we've identified, the amount of money that we're reinvesting into our store fleet to make them more exciting places to shop and create more engagement with our consumers, regardless of the channel that they want to engage with us on. All those things are just a continuation of great work that's been done in the past with new peaks coming along the way. We remodeled about 30% of our domestic Foot Locker and Champ stores. We're getting after the Footaction models a bit this year. We've got remodel projects going on in Europe, Canada and Australia as well. So the productivity gains that we're seeing, we believe, can continue. We also believe that the inventory management and expense management that our team does gives us the flow-through opportunities that Lauren talked about."

We see exciting products, big product pillars that are driving the business in Western Europe for Foot Locker, serves us some excitement around the kids business in there as well. The segmentation work that we're doing with Runners Point and Sidestep started late in '14. The initial results look very promising. During '15, we saw, as we repositioned Runners Point as All Things Running, we saw a couple of key running silhouettes soften dramatically. Some really big silhouettes in the German runners mind soften dramatically. So the team is working hard to get the assortment right. We've also got some buildout configuration things that we're testing in both Sidestep and Runners Point. So we remain confident that Runners Point and Sidestep stores are a big positive for the future. And even with the impairment that we talked about, they were accretive to our business this year. So the write-down of SP24.com which was a heavy liquidation site, not really the way that we do business anymore. Runners Point, prior to the acquisition, drove a lot of business through there. We've done the look at the business and decided that, that's not where we're going to operate that business. So a lot of moving parts with it, but we remain committed and confident that Runners Point and Sidestep play a big role going forward for us."

It's a price-value relationship for our customer, and as long as they bring -- as our vendors bring innovation and excitement to the silhouettes, the customer doesn't really seem to have a lot of price resistance. The Fly Knit Air Force One is a great example. It's $175 because that flying it up changes the complexity of the shoe and in the consumers' mind changes the price value relationship. So the upper level of signature basketball got a little bit formulaic with everything bunching up in price points, so as we look forward, when you look at a Steph Curry shoe or you look at a Kyrie Irving shoe, we start to see a little bit more variance in those prices, and I expect that's what we'll see along the way. Our vendors do a great job of introducing a silhouette at a price level and then continuing to lever that up a bit as they add more excitement, whether it be finishes, whether it be textures, whatever, that the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more for.

We've seen -- obviously seen the product flowing, and we understand what the product engines are going to deliver over the remainder of the first quarter. So there's -- I'm very confident that mid-single digits is where we'll drive the quarter. We'll reaccelerate to the pace that we were at, I believe, before we came across the All-Star game comps, specifically. So as it relates to ASPs, again, ASPs are influenced by a lot of things. Part of it is the manufacturers suggested retail price. Part of it is our ability to sell full-priced goods by having them in the right s at the right time and the right size, so the customer is happy. Part of it is driven by our ability to leverage our cross-channel efforts to make sure that we have the ability to sell the last unit that's available in our entire fleet, and those efforts all contribute to an ASP build. I mentioned the -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about our Timberland business, for example. Timberland 6-inch boot is exactly the same cost of some of the marquee basketball shoes. The Air Force One Flyknit shoes in the same way some of the signature basketball shoes. As we continue to model the portfolio from the full range of price points and values that the customer sees, we're confident that ASPs will continue to grow. It's really -- if you take 1 specific segment, 1 specific category launch or signature basketball, you don't get a true model of what the portfolio looks like, but when you start to take $100 shoes that become $110 shoes that also has a positive impact on our ASPs. You take a look at not having to markdown a bunch of shoes that historically we may have had to markdown prior to the good inventory work that the teams done in the productivity gains that we've seen. So with all of the variables in the pricing model, we're confident that ASPs will continue to rise as our vendor partners continue to bring great innovative products into the marketplace."

Just a great quarter on a tough environment.

So yes, it's all of those things. Our DTC, we're continuing to invest across all channels. So certainly, our online and digital business, we engage with our consumer there. We tell great stories. We want them to start their morning and end their night with one of our brand banners on their digital device. We also know that the consumer likes to still touch product and see product and have an immediacy of being able to get that great new release product. So the stores become realistically the only place that you can have it now when it releases. So as we continue to invest with our vendor partners to create more exciting places to shop in the malls as we continue to find better location in malls, as we continue to rightsize properties and drive productivity, those things, we believe, are all defensible. Our service model we think is defensible. We've got the best fleet of people across our portfolio to take care of customers. We are the resident experts. People come in and look to our strikers in the Foot Locker doors as the sneaker expert. Our customers come in and want to talk about the releases. They want to talk about what happened in the game last night and do you think the Kobe shoe will be retro-ed. All of those things. So that, we believe, both from a physical engagement in the store and a digital engagement, we think those things are all defensible. And obviously, the wholesale part of our vendors' business is still a much bigger chunk of our vendors business. So the fact that they are willing to continue to invest with us, jointly invest with us, walk out and say loudly, ""We opened up 40-plus properties last year that we partnered with our vendors on."" We continue to see that opportunity going forward. So the consumer likes choice. And I know that on the digital device, choice is only a click away, but based on times like they look at that ball and say, ""That's really cool. That's really cool."" And we've got some exclusive product that's only available with within the Foot Locker family, so those things all create defensible positions, I think, Eric."

She's SIX:02 leads a very active lifestyle, but she wants to look great while she's doing it. She expects all of the products to have performance attributes and perform regardless of whether she's in spin class, she's out for a run, she's doing yoga. It doesn't make any difference she knows that the product that is going to be in SIX:02 is going to have performance director sticks, but she's also very, very informed about style and wants to be looking different, looking good in her classes, going out after class for a juice or coffee. Whatever happens to be, she wants to have that style quotient invested as well. So we use the word fashion. I would compound that by saying it's really more style in making sure that it's not about necessarily being the ripped hard body. It's more about looking great as I do things. And we're working with our vendor partners and we've seen some success. The and product that we brought in that has a little more style quotient to it has performed well the footwear site we've seen the connectivity whether Rihanna and the PUMA Creeper and the product that's launching, I think, today very well-received by the consumer. So it's more style than fashion, but something I think we probably didn't have enough off an hour early rendition. So as we get the product assortment right, the vendor assortment right, then our confidence level is high in SIX:02. But the other reason for slowing and we talked about it in the prepared remarks, but we're going to have really pinnacles spaces in Manhattan for SIX:02 that we have not had up to this point. SIX:02 will have a store inside a store, if you will, of our flagship locations here on 34th Street come April up on Times Square later in the year, and that's a really big effort because those stores will really be the face of the brand for a lot of our industry, and we're excited about those opportunities.

We've also got a big effort in 2016 to relaunch the website to make sure that, that is by far our biggest store and has the most resonance with this consumer, so it's a combination of both. And once we feel like we've got all of the elements in place, there will be an aha moment from a brand campaign point of view. We started out by trying to grow the brand more from the grassroots point of view, smaller local events. And as we get the confidence of that we've got this formula right, there will be a bigger opportunity for aha moment, and it will time I end up flagship stores here. It will tie in the 30 doors we got around the country, and it will certainly tie in our digital space that will be launched this year. So again it's a work in progress, and we've said it before if this women's space was easy, there'd be a lot of people winning in the space and are a lot of people competing for this space, there's nobody winning.

Welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you very much for joining us today. 
As reported in this morning's press release, the company achieved GAAP net income of $158 million in the fourth quarter, up from $146 million in the fourth quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.14 this year on a GAAP basis compared to $1.01 in the same period a year ago, a 13% increase. 
As noted in our release, we had onetime items in both this just-completed quarter and last year's Q4. This year, the company recorded a pretax charge of $5 million, $4 million after tax, to reflect the impairment of certain Runners Point Group assets, thus reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. A year ago, the fourth quarter included a gain from the sale of a property as well as a write-down of a trade name. 
Excluding these items, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.16, a 16% increase over the $1 a share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as otherwise indicated, the numbers mentioned during our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results.
The strong finish to the year brought our annual non-GAAP net income to $606 million, also 16% up from a year ago and our fourth consecutive year achieving record annual earnings. On a per share basis, earnings were $4.29 for the full year, an increase of 20% over last year's $3.58. 
Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will lead off our call this morning with a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial performance; followed by Dick Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will touch on product trends and our progress in year 1 executing our current strategic initiatives as we work towards the long-term financial objectives outlined in last year's Investor Day.

315394,324790739,942347,"Foot Locker, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Foot Locker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all.

We do appreciate you joining us as we review our 2015 results and take a first look at 2016. It was indeed an outstanding year for Foot Locker, and I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, we were able to sustain the top line momentum we had built throughout the year, posting a 7.9% comparable sales gain on top of last year's 10.2% increase. 
Our international divisions had an outstanding year. In fact, total sales increased more than 10% in local currency in each of our regions. The fourth quarter was led by Foot Locker Asia Pacific with a mid-teens comparable sales gain on top of a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter last year. Close behind were Foot Locker Europe, with an increase in the teens; and Foot Locker Canada, which was up double digits. 
Unfortunately, our Runners Point Group stores did not share in that success, with both the Runners Point and Sidestep banners down mid-single digits. This performance contributed to the impairment charge John mentioned, which had 2 components: a write-down of the assets of some underperforming stores and the impairment of the trade name sp24.com, the clearance website that Runners Point was operating when we acquired the business. We have decided to deemphasize sp24.com as not consistent with our company's overall position as a retailer of premium full-price athletic footwear and apparel. 
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in another strong performance with an overall comparable sales gain of 9.6%. Our domestic store banner dot-com businesses collectively increased sales more than 20%, with even faster growth outside the U.S. Eastbay sales declined low single digits. The true performance part of the athletic industry where Eastbay's assortments are strongest have slowed relative to casual. We also believe the strength of the U.S. dollar kept some Eastbay customers shopping locally in their home markets.
Our domestic divisions all posted solid sales performances, with Kids Foot Locker leading the way with a high single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit total revenue increase, factoring in the addition of 13 net new kids stores during the year. Foot Locker in the U.S., Champs Sports and Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up mid-single digits while Footaction was up low single digits this quarter on top of the double-digit increase in Q4 last year. 
Footwear once again drove our sales gains, up double digits overall in the quarter. Men's footwear was up high single digits while women's and kids' footwear were both up double digits. By category, running was up into teens while basketball, with underlying shifts that Dick will highlight in a moment, was up at the low end of mid-single digits.
True apparel, meaning tops and bottoms, was up low single digits while the smaller accessories business, including socks and hats, posted a high single-digit comp decline. Overall, sales of apparel and accessories were down just a few basis points. 
Similar to the other quarters of 2015 reported sales were reduced significantly in Q4 due to the impact of weaker FX rates this year compared to rates of a year ago. Thus, our 7.9% comparable sales gain translated into a reported sales increase of 5%. Although it is early days for 2016 and we have no special insight as to where currencies are going to go, for now, we seem to have cycled through the bulk of the FX impact.
Our monthly comp cadence was highlighted by an exceptionally strong December, which was up in the teens. Comparable sales in November finished at the low end of mid-singles, and January increased at a low single-digit pace. While January was running stronger than that, the Snowstorm Jonas and the slower distribution of income tax refund checks in the U.S. caused sales to tail off in the last 2 weeks.
Moving down the P&L to gross margin. We produced an excellent 70 basis point improvement to 33.6% of sales from 32.9% last year. There were 2 primary factors driving the increase. First, merchandise margin improved 50 basis points due primarily to lower markdowns, although the increased proportion of footwear in our sales mix also provided a margin lift. Apparel margins improved even more than footwear margins in the quarter, although they still remain below footwear. Second, we achieved leverage of 40 basis points on our relatively fixed buyer and occupancy expenses. These 2 factors were partially offset by 20 basis points of headwind related to FX.
Our team once again did a good job managing expenses in the quarter as our selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 19.3% of sales from 19.6% of sales last year. While we were headed for a bit more SG&A leverage, the sales dynamics in the last 2 weeks of the quarter did not leave much room to adjust variable expenses. Overall, our full year SG&A expense rate improved by 80 basis points from 19.9% to an all-time low, 19.1% as we continue to drive productivity. For example, our sales per payroll hour improved in almost every division, and our overall sales per gross square foot surpassed $500 for the first time, reaching $504. 
Depreciation expense increased this quarter to $39 million from $33 million. For the full year, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $148 million due to the ongoing investment in the customer experience in our stores, our digital sites and various system technologies. 
Our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes reached a rate of 12.8% of sales, above the long-range goal of 12.5% we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year and the first of those goals which we have reached. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 35.4%, above last year's Q4 rate but below our expected run rate of 36.5% due largely to the expiration of statutes of limitations on foreign tax positions the company had taken in prior years. 
On the bottom line, it was another record quarter for our company and another record year. EPS of $1.16 in Q4 marks the third quarter this year that we achieved at least $1 per share in earnings. Adjusted net income was $606 million in 2015, a 16% increase over last year. Our net income margin was 8.2%, approaching our long-range goal of 8.5%, while return on invested capital improved to 15.8%. Unequivocally, it was another excellent performance by the entire team at Foot Locker that enabled the company to achieve such outstanding results. 
Full year EPS was $4.29 compared to $3.58 last year, a 20% improvement in EPS, was 4% higher than the increase in net income, reflecting the significant return of cash to shareholders we executed throughout the year via our share repurchase program. For the quarter, we spent $103 million to repurchase a total of 1.64 million shares, bringing our full year to 6.7 million shares at the cost of $419 million. We also returned $139 million of cash to investors in the form of dividends during 2015, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $558 million, more than 90% of adjusted net income. 
As we announced last week, our board declared a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend payout rate to $0.275 per share. And at year-end, we had $637 million remaining on the $1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized a year ago. With a solid financial position and a history of generating significant annual cash flow, we and the board believe that the company has the ability to continue returning a substantial amount of cash directly to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our financial performance towards our long-range objectives in the years ahead.
My final comment before I hand the call over to Dick is on inventory, which remains current and increasingly productive. It increased 2.8% at actual FX rate compared to a 5% sales increase. Using constant currencies, inventory was up 4.1%, in line with our standard when compared to our 8.8% total sales increase. 
I'll turn the call over to Dick now and be back in a bit to wrap up our remarks with 2016 guidance."

My first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer came just about a year ago, and I recall being very pleased then to be able to report the remarkable record-breaking achievements that the team produced during 2",1717,"Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. My first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer came just about a year ago, and I recall being very pleased then to be able to report the remarkable record-breaking achievements that the team produced during 2014. And today, I could not be more proud to report that the team was able to surpass in 2015 almost every financial and operational metric from 2014. 
Although we know that breaking records is what is expected of a high-performing team, I must first thank all the individual associates who made it happen. Their love of the game was apparent everywhere I visited this past year, from the store associates I watched engaging with customers to the various division headquarters teams working out how to win consistently with their core customer, to the support facility personnel teaming up with operations. I saw they're making sure everything they do helps lead to a happy customer as he or she leaves the store or one of our websites with some exciting new sneakers or apparel. All along the way, I witnessed a lot of passion for winning with our customers.  In a pattern that has developed in recent years, we achieved sales gains in all regions, channels and genders and in most banners and product categories. We believe this broad-based consistent performance reflects the leadership positions we have developed as a company across our merchant and operations teams, not to mention our equally talented support functions. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going over product highlights since most of the trends of the first part of the year carried over into the fourth quarter. I will say that we made substantial progress improving the sales and productivity of all 4 legs of our product category stool: basketball, running and casual footwear, along with apparel. As the year unfolded, I believe it became increasingly clear that we have developed a leading position in more than just basketball sneakers. A perfect example was our running business, in which we delivered a mid-teen comparable sales gain in the quarter with double-digit gains in every region. This excellent performance was driven by lifestyle silhouettes, such as Roshe, Huarache and Max Air from Nike and ZX Flux from adidas, as we lead the market in delivering trend-right running styles. 
Meanwhile, the rumored death of basketball, where our leadership position is most widely recognized, has been greatly exaggerated. Although growth in the basketball category during the quarter was modest relative to running, it was nonetheless growth with 3 primary factors contributing: first, strength in the Jordan Brand, especially in North America; second, the rise of new marquee star such as Kyrie Irving at Nike and Stephen Curry at Under Armour; and third momentum in classic basketball style such as Air Force 1s. Gains in these areas were more than enough to offset the current slowdown in sales of other signature product.
We also led the industry in sales of a wide variety of classic sneakers, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our footwear assortments. We took a strong position adi Originals styles, such as Superstars and Stan Smiths, while also delivering popular casual styles from New Balance, PUMA and ASICS. And not least, our Timberland boot business performed exceptionally well despite the relatively mild winter weather during much of the quarter.
Let me now turn to a brief progress report on our strategic initiatives. First, our core business continued to perform very well, producing robust top and bottom growth in quarter and full year. We built on our leadership position in creating fresh and engaging store environments, having now remodeled approximately 30% of our domestic Foot Locker and Champs Sports stores and just under 20% of our Footaction stores. We also opened more than 40 shop-in-shops in partnership with our vendors, about half of which were House of Hoops. In 2016, we intend to continue expanding both our remodel and vendor partnership programs. 
Second, our kids growth pillar demonstrated outstanding progress, increasing sales well into double digits when considering sales of children's product across all of our banners. In addition to the 13 net new KFL division stores Lauren mentioned, we also added kids stores in Europe and in Canada, and we also added about 30 new Fly Zone shops in the U.S. in partnership with Nike. This strategy, too, we plan to continue in 2016. 
Third, our Foot Locker business in Europe delivered a double-digit comparable sales gain in almost every country and double-digit growth across all families of business. The team there did a truly exceptional job this year leading the entire market in offering the hot new styles I mentioned earlier, such as the various Nike modern comfort and adi Originals lines as well as Air Max and Jordan. We continue to work hard at refining and implementing our European banners segmentation strategy, and we remain fully confident that the Runners Point and Sidestep banners can contribute much more to our future success in Europe. Meanwhile, the expansion of our Kids Foot Locker banner in Europe is already proving quite successful, and we intend to build on that strength over the next several years. 
We made progress on our next growth apparel -- growth pillar, apparel, although at a somewhat slower pace than the others. Lauren mentioned that sales in the category were down slightly in the quarter. The same was true for the year, although apparel profits both in terms of rate and, most importantly, dollars were up significantly. Foot Locker Europe posted the best apparel performance with a double-digit sales increase and an improved margin rate. We're working hard with our vendors to develop special, athletically inspired and fashion-right assortments, differentiated by banner to drive the level of excitement in the apparel category to be on par with the premium footwear selections our customers expect from us. We've been strengthening our team and working with our partners for some time on this, and clearly, full success has not and will not come overnight. However, given how important apparel is to the vendors' own growth objectives, we remain highly confident that together we will win with the customer for his or her apparel needs, too.
Our digital business had another successful quarter and year. We have invested in mobile and desktop sites as well as apps to deliver an enhanced digital experience, including more personalized interactions with our customers. As you can imagine from our young customers, mobile represents a huge part of our online traffic and a rapidly growing percent of our digital sales. Our direct-to-customer sales reached 12.7% of total sales, up from 12.1% a year ago, and our domestic footlocker.com and ladyfootlocker.com businesses were both well above the 10% target we set for our dot-com sales as a percent of total banner sales. We are completely channel-neutral as a company, with roughly comparable margins for both our store and direct segments, so we intend to let the customers decide what the direct-to-customer penetration rate will ultimately be rather than try to steer it one way or the other. 
Our other growth pillar is women's, and we made good progress in there, especially in footwear. The Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 division delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of comp store sales gains, and our women's footwear sales in Foot Locker and Champs Sports increased double digits for the year. We opened 15 new SIX:02 doors, bringing our total to 30. We still aren't quite where we want to be with the performance of SIX:02, so we are slowing the store openings in 2016 as we focus on developing brand awareness, resetting the product assortments, relaunching the SIX:02 website and creating pinnacle SIX:02 experiences inside our New York City flagship stores. 
To oversimplify the situation a bit, we believe we have overemphasized the performance aspect of what our customers want in terms of athletically inspired apparel. It's a given that she expects the product to have performance functionality, but the SIX:02 customer really wants apparel but also has a sharp fashion edge. We are working hard with our vendors to elevate our product offerings through innovation, style and scarcity based, in many cases, on celebrity designs or endorsements, such as what we're seeing with Rihanna. As in men's apparel, this is not a 1 or 2-season fix, and the vendors are highly committed to making this work. As I said, we're already making progress so we remain confident and fully committed to delivering exceptional growth in women's footwear and apparel. 
As part of that commitment, we announced last week some key organizational changes, highlighted by the promotions of Jake Jacobs to head our store business in North America and Lew Kimble to head our businesses outside North America. They have each done an exceptional job leading their respective teams in the execution of the key initiatives of our strategic plan. In addition to their promotions, we reconfigured the leadership of each of our banners under a vice president and general manager. We believe this structure will well position us in the global athletic marketplace; align with our key vendor partners; and, most importantly, elevate the relevance, connectivity and experiences that the customers of each of our banners expect. 
We separated the leadership of SIX:02, which will continue to be led by Natalie Ellis from Lady Foot Locker, which will fold into the Foot Locker U.S. banner led by Andy Gray. We have come to realize that the core customer of Lady Foot Locker is more similar to the female Foot Locker customer than she is to the SIX:02 customer, and Natalie can now focus solely on building the SIX:02 banner into the premier athletic retail destination for the more fashion-forward active young woman without the added responsibility of simultaneously managing the transition of Lady Foot Locker. 
I want to congratulate Jake and Lew and all of the new general managers of our banners. Foot Locker's depth of talent around the globe is a tremendous strength contributing to the high-performing company we have become. I'm very excited to see the team continue to execute our strategies and achieve even greater success in the years ahead.
With that, let me turn the call back to Lauren to give you more specifics on how we see 2016 shaping up."

As a result, we can once again provide the same high-level guidance for 2016 that we've given in recent years. We believe we can deliver",727,"Thanks, Dick. We have indeed become a high-performing company, and we believe our momentum should continue in 2016. As a result, we can once again provide the same high-level guidance for 2016 that we've given in recent years. 
We believe we can deliver a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage earnings per share increase this year. 
We have planned the year with FX rates close to where they are now, with the euro around $1.10 and the Canadian and Australian dollars around $0.70. The latter 2 currencies are weaker now than a year ago so there will be a few cents of FX headwinds in 2016 but much, much less than the $0.23 of stronger dollar cost for EPS in 2015 relative to 2014 FX rates. 
We are planning for a slight improvement in our annual gross margin rate in the 10 to 30 basis point range, mostly driven by leverage of our buyer and occupancy costs. We do believe that we have the ongoing opportunity, with the benefit of our merchandise allocation, system investments and other productivity initiatives, to improve full-price selling and thus, improve our merchandise margin as well. 
We intend to remain disciplined in managing expenses in 2016. We should also be able to lever on the fixed cost elements of SG&A to produce a modest 10 to 30 basis point rate improvement. We do have a Q1 headwind due to our office relocation down the block in New York City, which will add about $4 million of expense due to paying rent on both locations plus the cost of the move itself. Our lease here is up at the end of April, so after Q1, this expense will normalize. However, we could actually delever SG&A slightly in Q1. This annual SG&A guidance also incorporates all known minimum wage rate increases and changes in health care costs.
Let's talk capital expenditures for a minute. As you've seen, we've announced a $297 million program for 2016, up from the $225 million we spent last year. We intend to continue our remodel and vendor partnership programs as we elevate the customer experience across our banners. Combined with approximately 90 new stores concentrated in Europe, Kids Foot Locker in the U.S. and Footaction, we expect to spend more than $200 million on improving our store fleet in 2016. This amount includes close to $10 million to transform 2 of our New York flagship stores, one here on 34th Street and the other up at Times Square. 
There are some other large nonrecurring outlays included in this year's capital plan, including more than $20 million to build out our new headquarters location and a similar amount for our new online order management system and related customer experience initiative. Although we believe 2016 will represent a peak in capital expenditures, we now project spending closer to $250 million in the couple of years after this, up from the annual $225 million we mentioned in our Investor Day a year ago. 
With this level of capital investment in the business, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $170 million to $175 million in 2016. In addition to opening approximately 90 stores, we plan to close about 100, which will leave our store count relatively flat year-over-year. The store closures will once again be concentrated in Lady Foot Locker and Foot Locker in the U.S. 
We are planning interest expense to be fairly flat to this year's $4 million, and we are continuing to plan our effective tax rate of 36.5% in 2016. Our guidance of a double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count based on the continued execution of our share repurchase program. Although we are planning a mid-single-digit comp gain in each quarter, the profit flow-through challenge may be greatest in Q1, in turn creating a challenge to achieving double-digit EPS growth this quarter. 
With the income tax refund shift I mentioned and the difficult compare of last year's NBA All-Star game being in New York, we're expecting February's comp to be up low single digits, and we're expecting a solid mid-single-digit comp in the remainder of the quarter. That covers the highlights of 2016. We're looking forward to another very exciting year. 
Let me now ask Carlos to open up the call to your questions."

The confidence comes from having some vision into the pipeline, obviously, both in footwear and apparel, as I said, great product coming down the pike. February is a little bit of an anomaly given the incredible All-Star game that we had last year in New York. We had a great All-Star game up in Toronto, but just based on the store coverage in the Greater New York City area and the places that we had to activate with consumers, Toronto just doesn't have that sort of store base for us. So as we look at Q1 and on into Q2 when the Olympics will be really heating up, we've got the Euro championships going on as well, so a lot of excitement around sport, which elevates all of the product offerings and the excitement with the consumer. So the ability to drive those comp gains, Lauren talked a lot about the productivity tools that we've identified, the amount of money that we're reinvesting into our store fleet to make them more exciting places to shop and create more engagement with our consumers regardless of the channel that they want to engage with us on. All those things are just a continuation of great work that's been done in the past, with new peaks coming along the way. We've remodeled about 30% of our domestic Foot Locker and Champs stores. We're getting after the Footaction remodels a bit this year. We've got remodel projects going on in Europe, Canada and Australia as well. So the productivity gains that we're seeing, we believe, can continue.

We see exciting products, big product pillars that are driving the business in Western Europe for Foot Locker, certainly some excitement around the kids business there as well. The segmentation work that we're doing with Runners Point and Sidestep, we started late in '14. The initial results look very promising. During '15, we saw -- as we reposition Runners Point as all things running, we saw a couple of key running silhouettes soften dramatically. Some really big silhouettes in the German runner's mind softened dramatically. So the team in Recklinghausen is working hard to get the assortment right. We've also got some build-out configuration things that we're testing in both Sidestep and Runners Point. So we remain confident that Runners Point and Sidestep doors are a big positive for the future. And even with the impairment that we've talked about, they were accretive to our business this year. So the write-down of sp24.com, which was a heavy liquidation site, not really the way that we do business anymore. Runners Point, prior to the acquisition, drove a lot of business through there. We've done the look at the business and decided that, that's not where we're going to operate that business.

The Flyknit Air Force 1 is a great example. It's $175 because that Flyknit upper changes the complexity of the shoe and, in the consumers' mind, changes the price-value relationship. So the upper level of signature basketball got a little bit formulaic with everything bunching up in price points. So as we look forward, when you look at a Steph Curry shoe or you look at a Kyrie Irving shoe, you start to see a little bit more variance in those prices, and I expect that's what we'll see along the way. Our vendors do a great job of introducing a silhouette at a price level and then continuing to lever that up a bit as they add more excitement, whether it be finishes, whether it be textures, whatever, that the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more for.

They set the amount of product that they want to put into the marketplace, and we work closely with them, obviously, to maximize our position in -- across all of the launches. So again, it's -- a lot of people focus on launch and it's an important part of the business, but you have to remember the strength of our business is really a 4-leg stool with basketball being significant, running being significant, casual being significant and apparel certainly starting to become significant."

The -- I think Q1, Robbie, is a function of -- we talked about some of the slowdown in February being driven by tax situation and a really robust All-Star game from last year. Those things were both neutralized going into the rest of the quarter. We've seen -- obviously seen the product flow, and we understand what the product engines are going to deliver over the remainder of the first quarter. So there's -- I'm very confident that mid-single digits is where we'll drive the quarter. We'll reaccelerate to the pace that we were at, I believe, before we came across the All-Star game comps, specifically. So -- and as it relates to ASPs, again, ASPs are influenced by a lot of things. Part of it is the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Part of it is our ability to sell full-priced goods by having them in the right store at the right time in the right size so that the customer is happy. Part of it is driven by our ability to leverage our cross-channel efforts to make sure that we have the ability to sell the last unit that's available in our entire fleet, and those efforts all contribute to an ASP build. I've mentioned -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about our Timberland business, for example. Timberland 6-inch width boot is exactly the same cost to some of the marquee basketball shoes. The Air Force 1 Flyknit shoe is in the same range as some of the signature basketball shoes. As we continue to model the portfolio from the full range of price points and values that the customer sees, we're confident that ASPs will continue to grow. It's really -- if you take one specific segment, one specific category launch or signature basketball, you don't get a true model of what the portfolio looks like. But when you start to take $100 shoes that become $110 shoes, that also has a positive impact on our ASPs. You take a look at not having to mark down a bunch of shoes that, historically, we may have had to mark down prior to the good inventory work that the team's done and the productivity gains that we've seen. So with all of the variables in the pricing model, we're confident that ASPs will continue to rise as the -- as our vendor partners continue to bring great innovative products into the marketplace."

So that allocation tool that we've put in, as we've described before, is really a multiyear project, and it continues to deliver dividends as that learning -- system learns more and the humans using it learn more about it. The apparel element as well. We described that apparel margins, while they improved significantly in the quarter, are still running behind footwear, and we really think that when we get to the place where we're at the top of our game in apparel, that those margins will be meaningfully ahead of footwear. So that's an opportunity for us. And Dick described making that last unit of inventory available no matter where it is in the system, is another thing that helps us with getting more value out of each and every unit. That helps the margins. So with the breadth of things that we're working on, we continue to think that we've got opportunity there. But to lever on the fixed, I mean we have described that we have gotten into some big properties and doing some things in flagship spaces that does add -- the higher rent that comes with those, and that puts a little bit of pressure on levering. We think that we can still lever looks more like the low end of mid-singles on those fixed elements within margins."

So yes, it's all of those things, right? Our DTC, we're continuing to invest across all channels. So certainly, our online and digital business, we engage with our consumer there. We tell great stories. We want them to start their morning and end their night with one of our band -- brand banners on their digital device. We also know that the consumer likes to still touch product and see product and have an immediacy of being able to get that great new release product. So the stores become realistically the only place that you can have it now when it releases. So as we continue to invest with our vendor partners to create more exciting places to shop in the malls, as we continue to find better location in malls, as we continue to rightsize properties and drive productivity, those things, we believe, are all defensible. Our service model, we think, is defensible. We've got the best fleet of people across our portfolio to take care of customers. They are the resident experts. People come in and look to our stripers in the Foot Locker doors as the sneaker expert. Our customers come in and want to talk about releases. They want to talk about what happened in the game last night and do you think the Kobe shoe will be retro-ed and all of those things. So that, we believe, both from a physical engagement in the store and a digital engagement, we think those things are all defensible. And obviously, the wholesale part of our vendors' business is still a much bigger chunk of our vendors' business. So the fact that they are willing to continue to invest with us -- jointly invest with us, walk out and say loudly, ""We opened up 40-plus properties last year that we partnered with our vendors on,"" we continue to see that opportunity going forward. So the consumer likes choice, and I know that on the digital device, choice is only a click away. But they sometimes like to look at that wall and say, ""Hey, that's really cool. That's really cool."" And we've got some exclusive product that's only available within the Foot Locker family. So those things all create defensible positions, I think, Eric."

She expects all of the product to have performance attributes and perform regardless of whether she's in a spin class, she's out for a run, she's doing yoga, it doesn't make any difference. She knows that the product that's going to be in SIX:02 is going to have performance characteristics. But she's also very, very informed about style and wants to be looking different, looking good in her classes, going out after class for a juice or coffee. Whatever happens to be, she wants to have that style quotient invested as well. So we use the word fashion. I would compound that by saying it's really more style and making sure that it's not about necessarily being the ripped hard body. It's more about looking great as I do things. And we're working with our vendor partners, and we've seen some success. The ALALA and Koral product that we brought in that has a little more style quotient to it has performed well. On the footwear side, we've seen the connectivity with Rihanna and the PUMA Creeper and the Vente [ph] product that's launching, I think, today, very well-received by the consumer. So it's more style than fashion, Eric, but something that I think we probably didn't have enough of in our early rendition. So as we get the product assortment right, the vendor assortment right, again, our confidence level is high on SIX:02. But the other reason for slowing, and we talked about it in the prepared remarks, but we're going to have really pinnacle spaces in Manhattan for SIX:02 that we have not had up to this point. SIX:02 will have a store inside a store, if you will, in our flagship locations here on 34th Street come April and up on Times Square later in the year. And that's a really big effort because those stores will really be the face of the brand for a lot of our industry, and we're excited about those opportunities.

The connectivity between PUMA and Rihanna has sort of changed the model on the women's side. In most cases, our vendor partners have looked at female athletes as that role model or as that model, if you will, very similar to the men's side of the business. But as we see the success with Rihanna, we see similar success with Stella McCartney from the adidas brand. There are designers and celebrities, if you will, that connect with this core consumer. So our ability to work with our vendor partners to bring exciting product to the marketplace quicker, to your point -- speed to market is important with her because once it's seen, she wants it. And it's not dissimilar to what you saw in the New York Fashion Week where a couple of people in fashion weeks are making a product directly available for sale right after fashion week. Rather than saying, ""This is the fall lineup. You can buy it next fall"" they're saying, ""Here's this product and you can have it today."" That's the sort of environment our consumer lives in, and we'll continue to work with our vendor partners to accelerate the speed to market."

Welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you very much for joining us today.

Welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you very much for joining us today. 
As reported in this morning's press release, the company achieved GAAP net income of $158 million in the fourth quarter, up from $146 million in the fourth quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.14 this year on a GAAP basis compared to $1.01 in the same period a year ago, a 13% increase. 
As noted in our release, we had onetime items in both this just-completed quarter and last year's Q4. This year, the company recorded a pretax charge of $5 million, $4 million after tax, to reflect the impairment of certain Runners Point Group assets, thus reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. A year ago, the fourth quarter included a gain from the sale of a property as well as a write-down of a trade name. 
Excluding these items, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.16, a 16% increase over the $1.00 a share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release and, except as otherwise indicated, the numbers mentioned during our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results.
The strong finish to the year brought our annual non-GAAP net income to $606 million, also 16% up from a year ago and our fourth consecutive year achieving record annual earnings. On a per share basis, earnings were $4.29 for the full year, an increase of 20% over last year's $3.58. 
Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will lead off our call this morning with a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial performance; followed by Dick Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will touch on product trends and our progress in year 1 executing our current strategic initiatives as we work towards the long-term financial objectives outlined in last year's Investor Day. Lauren will complete our prepared remarks with an overview of our annual and quarterly expectations for 2016. Lauren?"

We do appreciate you joining us as we review our 2015 results and take a first look at 2016. It was indeed an outstanding year for Foot Locker, and I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, we were abl",1359,"Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We do appreciate you joining us as we review our 2015 results and take a first look at 2016. It was indeed an outstanding year for Foot Locker, and I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, we were able to sustain the top line momentum we had built throughout the year, posting a 7.9% comparable sales gain on top of last year's 10.2% increase. 
Our international divisions had an outstanding year. In fact, total sales increased more than 10% in local currency in each of our regions. The fourth quarter was led by Foot Locker Asia Pacific with a mid-teens comparable sales gain on top of a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter last year. Close behind were Foot Locker Europe, with an increase in the teens; and Foot Locker Canada, which was up double digits. 
Unfortunately, our Runners Point Group stores did not share in that success, with both the Runners Point and Sidestep banners down mid-single digits. This performance contributed to the impairment charge John mentioned, which had 2 components: a write-down of the assets of some underperforming stores and the impairment of the trade name sp24.com, the clearance website that Runners Point was operating when we acquired the business. We have decided to deemphasize sp24.com as not consistent with our company's overall position as a retailer of premium full-price athletic footwear and apparel. 
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in another strong performance with an overall comparable sales gain of 9.6%. Our domestic store banner dot-com businesses collectively increased sales more than 20%, with even faster growth outside the U.S. Eastbay sales declined low single digits. The true performance part of the athletic industry where Eastbay's assortments are strongest have slowed relative to casual. We also believe the strength of the U.S. dollar kept some Eastbay customers shopping locally in their home markets.
Our domestic divisions all posted solid sales performances, with Kids Foot Locker leading the way with a high single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit total revenue increase, factoring in the addition of 13 net new kids stores during the year. Foot Locker in the U.S., Champs Sports and Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up mid-single digits while Footaction was up low single digits this quarter on top of the double-digit increase in Q4 last year. 
Footwear once again drove our sales gains, up double digits overall in the quarter. Men's footwear was up high single digits while women's and kids' footwear were both up double digits. By category, running was up into teens while basketball, with underlying shifts that Dick will highlight in a moment, was up at the low end of mid-single digits.
True apparel, meaning tops and bottoms, was up low single digits while the smaller accessories business, including socks and hats, posted a high single-digit comp decline. Overall, sales of apparel and accessories were down just a few basis points. 
Similar to the other quarters of 2015 reported sales were reduced significantly in Q4 due to the impact of weaker FX rates this year compared to rates of a year ago. Thus, our 7.9% comparable sales gain translated into a reported sales increase of 5%. Although it is early days for 2016 and we have no special insight as to where currencies are going to go, for now, we seem to have cycled through the bulk of the FX impact.
Our monthly comp cadence was highlighted by an exceptionally strong December, which was up in the teens. Comparable sales in November finished at the low end of mid-singles, and January increased at a low single-digit pace. While January was running stronger than that, the Snowstorm Jonas and the slower distribution of income tax refund checks in the U.S. caused sales to tail off in the last 2 weeks.
Moving down the P&L to gross margin. We produced an excellent 70 basis point improvement to 33.6% of sales from 32.9% last year. There were 2 primary factors driving the increase. First, merchandise margin improved 50 basis points due primarily to lower markdowns, although the increased proportion of footwear in our sales mix also provided a margin lift. Apparel margins improved even more than footwear margins in the quarter, although they still remain below footwear. Second, we achieved leverage of 40 basis points on our relatively fixed buyer and occupancy expenses. These 2 factors were partially offset by 20 basis points of headwind related to FX.
Our team once again did a good job managing expenses in the quarter as our selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 19.3% of sales from 19.6% of sales last year. While we were headed for a bit more SG&A leverage, the sales dynamics in the last 2 weeks of the quarter did not leave much room to adjust variable expenses. Overall, our full year SG&A expense rate improved by 80 basis points from 19.9% to an all-time low, 19.1% as we continue to drive productivity. For example, our sales per payroll hour improved in almost every division, and our overall sales per gross square foot surpassed $500 for the first time, reaching $504. 
Depreciation expense increased this quarter to $39 million from $33 million. For the full year, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $148 million due to the ongoing investment in the customer experience in our stores, our digital sites and various system technologies. 
Our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes reached a rate of 12.8% of sales, above the long-range goal of 12.5% we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year and the first of those goals which we have reached. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 35.4%, above last year's Q4 rate but below our expected run rate of 36.5% due largely to the expiration of statutes of limitations on foreign tax positions the company had taken in prior years. 
On the bottom line, it was another record quarter for our company and another record year. EPS of $1.16 in Q4 marks the third quarter this year that we achieved at least $1.00 per share in earnings. Adjusted net income was $606 million in 2015, a 16% increase over last year. Our net income margin was 8.2%, approaching our long-range goal of 8.5%, while return on invested capital improved to 15.8%. Unequivocally, it was another excellent performance by the entire team at Foot Locker that enabled the company to achieve such outstanding results. 
Full year EPS was $4.29 compared to $3.58 last year, a 20% improvement in EPS, was 4% higher than the increase in net income, reflecting the significant return of cash to shareholders we executed throughout the year via our share repurchase program. For the quarter, we spent $103 million to repurchase a total of 1.64 million shares, bringing our full year to 6.7 million shares at the cost of $419 million. We also returned $139 million of cash to investors in the form of dividends during 2015, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $558 million, more than 90% of adjusted net income. 
As we announced last week, our board declared a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend payout rate to $0.275 per share. And at year-end, we had $637 million remaining on the $1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized a year ago. With a solid financial position and a history of generating significant annual cash flow, we and the board believe that the company has the ability to continue returning a substantial amount of cash directly to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our financial performance towards our long-range objectives in the years ahead.
My final comment before I hand the call over to Dick is on inventory, which remains current and increasingly productive. It increased 2.8% at actual FX rate compared to a 5% sales increase. Using constant currencies, inventory was up 4.1%, in line with our standard when compared to our 8.8% total sales increase. 
I'll turn the call over to Dick now and be back in a bit to wrap up our remarks with 2016 guidance."
315394,324790739,942552,"Foot Locker, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Foot Locker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. My first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer came just about a year ago, and I recall being very pleased then to be able to report the remarkable record-breaking achievements that the team produced during 2",1717,"Thanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. My first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer came just about a year ago, and I recall being very pleased then to be able to report the remarkable record-breaking achievements that the team produced during 2014. And today, I could not be more proud to report that the team was able to surpass in 2015 almost every financial and operational metric from 2014. 
Although we know that breaking records is what is expected of a high-performing team, I must first thank all the individual associates who made it happen. Their love of the game was apparent everywhere I visited this past year, from the store associates I watched engaging with customers to the various division headquarters teams working out how to win consistently with their core customer, to the support facility personnel teaming up with operations. I saw them making sure everything they do helps lead to a happy customer as he or she leaves the store or one of our websites with some exciting new sneakers or apparel. All along the way, I witnessed a lot of passion for winning with our customers.  In a pattern that has developed in recent years, we achieved sales gains in all regions, channels and genders and in most banners and product categories. We believe this broad-based consistent performance reflects the leadership positions we have developed as a company across our merchant and operations teams, not to mention our equally talented support functions. 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time going over product highlights since most of the trends of the first part of the year carried over into the fourth quarter. I will say that we made substantial progress improving the sales and productivity of all 4 legs of our product category stool: basketball, running and casual footwear, along with apparel. As the year unfolded, I believe it became increasingly clear that we have developed a leading position in more than just basketball sneakers. A perfect example was our running business, in which we delivered a mid-teen comparable sales gain in the quarter with double-digit gains in every region. This excellent performance was driven by lifestyle silhouettes, such as Roshe, Huarache and Max Air from Nike and ZX Flux from adidas, as we lead the market in delivering trend-right running styles. 
Meanwhile, the rumored death of basketball, where our leadership position is most widely recognized, has been greatly exaggerated. Although growth in the basketball category during the quarter was modest relative to running, it was nonetheless growth with 3 primary factors contributing: first, strength in the Jordan Brand, especially in North America; second, the rise of new marquee star such as Kyrie Irving at Nike and Stephen Curry at Under Armour; and third momentum in classic basketball styles such as Air Force 1s. Gains in these areas were more than enough to offset the current slowdown in sales of other signature product.
We also led the industry in sales of a wide variety of classic sneakers, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our footwear assortments. We took a strong position adi Originals styles, such as Superstars and Stan Smiths, while also delivering popular casual styles from New Balance, PUMA and ASICS. And not least, our Timberland boot business performed exceptionally well despite the relatively mild winter weather during much of the quarter.
Let me now turn to a brief progress report on our strategic initiatives. First, our core business continued to perform very well, producing robust top and bottom growth in quarter and full year. We built on our leadership position in creating fresh and engaging store environments, having now remodeled approximately 30% of our domestic Foot Locker and Champs Sports stores and just under 20% of our Footaction stores. We also opened more than 40 shop-in-shops in partnership with our vendors, about half of which were House of Hoops. In 2016, we intend to continue expanding both our remodel and vendor partnership programs. 
Second, our kids growth pillar demonstrated outstanding progress, increasing sales well into double digits when considering sales of children's product across all of our banners. In addition to the 13 net new KFL division stores Lauren mentioned, we also added kids stores in Europe and in Canada, and we also added about 30 new Fly Zone shops in the U.S. in partnership with Nike. This strategy, too, we plan to continue in 2016. 
Third, our Foot Locker business in Europe delivered a double-digit comparable sales gain in almost every country and double-digit growth across all families of business. The team there did a truly exceptional job this year leading the entire market in offering the hot new styles I mentioned earlier, such as the various Nike modern comfort and adi Originals lines as well as Air Max and Jordan. We continue to work hard at refining and implementing our European banners segmentation strategy, and we remain fully confident that the Runners Point and Sidestep banners can contribute much more to our future success in Europe. Meanwhile, the expansion of our Kids Foot Locker banner in Europe is already proving quite successful, and we intend to build on that strength over the next several years. 
We made progress on our next growth apparel -- growth pillar, apparel, although at a somewhat slower pace than the others. Lauren mentioned that sales in the category were down slightly in the quarter. The same was true for the year, although apparel profits both in terms of rate and, most importantly, dollars were up significantly. Foot Locker Europe posted the best apparel performance with a double-digit sales increase and an improved margin rate. We're working hard with our vendors to develop special, athletically inspired and fashion-right assortments, differentiated by banner to drive the level of excitement in the apparel category to be on par with the premium footwear selections our customers expect from us. We've been strengthening our team and working with our partners for some time on this, and clearly, full success has not and will not come overnight. However, given how important apparel is to the vendors' own growth objectives, we remain highly confident that together we will win with the customer for his or her apparel needs, too.
Our digital business had another successful quarter and year. We have invested in mobile and desktop sites as well as apps to deliver an enhanced digital experience, including more personalized interactions with our customers. As you can imagine from our young customers, mobile represents a huge part of our online traffic and a rapidly growing percent of our digital sales. Our direct-to-customer sales reached 12.7% of total sales, up from 12.1% a year ago, and our domestic footlocker.com and ladyfootlocker.com businesses were both well above the 10% target we set for our dot-com sales as a percent of total banner sales. We are completely channel-neutral as a company, with roughly comparable margins for both our store and direct segments, so we intend to let the customers decide what the direct-to-customer penetration rate will ultimately be rather than try to steer it one way or the other. 
Our other growth pillar is women's, and we made good progress in there, especially in footwear. The Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 division delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of comp store sales gains, and our women's footwear sales in Foot Locker and Champs Sports increased double digits for the year. We opened 15 new SIX:02 doors, bringing our total to 30. We still aren't quite where we want to be with the performance of SIX:02, so we are slowing the store openings in 2016 as we focus on developing brand awareness, resetting the product assortments, relaunching the SIX:02 website and creating pinnacle SIX:02 experiences inside our New York City flagship stores. 
To oversimplify the situation a bit, we believe we have overemphasized the performance aspect of what our customers want in terms of athletically inspired apparel. It's a given that she expects the product to have performance functionality, but the SIX:02 customer really wants apparel but also has a sharp fashion edge. We are working hard with our vendors to elevate our product offerings through innovation, style and scarcity based, in many cases, on celebrity designs or endorsements, such as what we're seeing with Rihanna. As in men's apparel, this is not a 1 or 2-season fix, and the vendors are highly committed to making this work. As I said, we're already making progress, so we remain confident and fully committed to delivering exceptional growth in women's footwear and apparel. 
As part of that commitment, we announced last week some key organizational changes, highlighted by the promotions of Jake Jacobs to head our store business in North America and Lew Kimble to head our businesses outside North America. They have each done an exceptional job leading their respective teams in the execution of the key initiatives of our strategic plan. In addition to their promotions, we reconfigured the leadership of each of our banners under a vice president and general manager. We believe this structure will well position us in the global athletic marketplace; align with our key vendor partners; and, most importantly, elevate the relevance, connectivity and experiences that the customers of each of our banners expect. 
We separated the leadership of SIX:02, which will continue to be led by Natalie Ellis, from Lady Foot Locker, which will fold into the Foot Locker U.S. banner led by Andy Gray. We have come to realize that the core customer of Lady Foot Locker is more similar to the female Foot Locker customer than she is to the SIX:02 customer, and Natalie can now focus solely on building the SIX:02 banner into the premier athletic retail destination for the more fashion-forward active young woman without the added responsibility of simultaneously managing the transition of Lady Foot Locker. 
I want to congratulate Jake and Lew and all of the new general managers of our banners. Foot Locker's depth of talent around the globe is a tremendous strength contributing to the high-performing company we have become. I'm very excited to see the team continue to execute our strategies and achieve even greater success in the years ahead.
With that, let me turn the call back to Lauren to give you more specifics on how we see 2016 shaping up."

As a result, we can once again provide the same high-level guidance for 2016 that we've given in recent years. We believe we can deliver",728,"Thanks, Dick. We have indeed become a high-performing company, and we believe our momentum should continue in 2016. As a result, we can once again provide the same high-level guidance for 2016 that we've given in recent years. 
We believe we can deliver a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage earnings per share increase this year. 
We have planned the year with FX rates close to where they are now, with the euro around $1.10 and the Canadian and Australian dollars around $0.70. The latter 2 currencies are weaker now than a year ago so there will be a few cents of FX headwinds in 2016 but much, much less than the $0.23 of stronger dollar cost for our EPS in 2015 relative to 2014 FX rates. 
We are planning for a slight improvement in our annual gross margin rate in the 10 to 30 basis point range, mostly driven by leverage of our buyer and occupancy costs. We do believe that we have the ongoing opportunity, with the benefit of our merchandise allocation, system investments and other productivity initiatives, to improve full-price selling and thus, improve our merchandise margin as well. 
We intend to remain disciplined in managing expenses in 2016. We should also be able to lever on the fixed cost elements of SG&A to produce a modest 10 to 30 basis point rate improvement. We do have a Q1 headwind due to our office relocation down the block in New York City, which will add about $4 million of expense due to paying rent on both locations plus the cost of the move itself. Our lease here is up at the end of April, so after Q1, this expense will normalize. However, we could actually delever SG&A slightly in Q1. This annual SG&A guidance also incorporates all known minimum wage rate increases and changes in health care costs.
Let's talk capital expenditures for a minute. As you've seen, we've announced a $297 million program for 2016, up from the $225 million we spent last year. We intend to continue our remodel and vendor partnership programs as we elevate the customer experience across our banners. Combined with approximately 90 new stores concentrated in Europe, Kids Foot Locker in the U.S. and Footaction, we expect to spend more than $200 million on improving our store fleet in 2016. This amount includes close to $10 million to transform 2 of our New York flagship stores, one here on 34th Street and the other up at Times Square. 
There are some other large nonrecurring outlays included in this year's capital plan, including more than $20 million to build out our new headquarters location and a similar amount for our new online order management system and related customer experience initiative. Although we believe 2016 will represent a peak in capital expenditures, we now project spending closer to $250 million in the couple of years after this, up from the annual $225 million we mentioned in our Investor Day a year ago. 
With this level of capital investment in the business, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $170 million to $175 million in 2016. In addition to opening approximately 90 stores, we plan to close about 100, which will leave our store count relatively flat year-over-year. The store closures will once again be concentrated in Lady Foot Locker and Foot Locker in the U.S. 
We are planning interest expense to be fairly flat to this year's $4 million, and we are continuing to plan our effective tax rate of 36.5% in 2016. Our guidance of a double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count based on the continued execution of our share repurchase program. Although we are planning a mid-single-digit comp gain in each quarter, the profit flow-through challenge may be greatest in Q1, in turn creating a challenge to achieving double-digit EPS growth this quarter. 
With the income tax refund shift I mentioned and the difficult compare of last year's NBA All-Star game being in New York, we're expecting February's comp to be up low single digits, and we're expecting a solid mid-single-digit comp in the remainder of the quarter. That covers the highlights of 2016. We're looking forward to another very exciting year.

The confidence comes from having some vision into the pipeline, obviously, both in footwear and apparel, as I said, great product coming down the pike. February is a little bit of an anomaly given the incredible All-Star game that we had last year in New York. We had a great All-Star game up in Toronto, but just based on the store coverage in the Greater New York City area and the places that we had to activate with consumers, Toronto just doesn't have that sort of store base for us. So as we look at Q1 and on into Q2 when the Olympics will be really heating up, we've got the Euro championships going on as well, so a lot of excitement around sport, which elevates all of the product offerings and the excitement with the consumer. 
So the ability to drive those comp gains, Lauren talked a lot about the productivity tools that we've identified, the amount of money that we're reinvesting into our store fleet to make them more exciting places to shop and create more engagement with our consumers regardless of the channel that they want to engage with us on. All those things are just a continuation of great work that's been done in the past, with new peaks coming along the way. We've remodeled about 30% of our domestic Foot Locker and Champs stores. We're getting after the Footaction remodels a bit this year. We've got remodel projects going on in Europe, Canada and Australia as well. So the productivity gains that we're seeing, we believe, can continue. We also believe that the inventory management and expense management that our team does gives us the flow-through opportunities that Lauren talked about."

We see exciting products, big product pillars that are driving the business in Western Europe for Foot Locker, certainly some excitement around the kids business there as well. The segmentation work that we're doing with Runners Point and Sidestep, we started late in '14. The initial results look very promising. During '15, we saw -- as we repositioned Runners Point as all things running, we saw a couple of key running silhouettes soften dramatically. Some really big silhouettes in the German runner's mind softened dramatically. So the team in Recklinghausen is working hard to get the assortment right. We've also got some build-out configuration things that we're testing in both Sidestep and Runners Point. So we remain confident that Runners Point and Sidestep doors are a big positive for the future. And even with the impairment that we've talked about, they were accretive to our business this year. So the write-down of sp24.com, which was a heavy liquidation site, not really the way that we do business anymore. Runners Point, prior to the acquisition, drove a lot of business through there. We've done the look at the business and decided that, that's not where we're going to operate that business. So a lot of moving parts with it, but we remain committed and confident that Runners Point and Sidestep play a big role going forward for us."

The Flyknit Air Force 1 is a great example. It's $175 because that Flyknit upper changes the complexity of the shoe and, in the consumers' mind, changes the price-value relationship. So the upper level of signature basketball got a little bit formulaic with everything bunching up in price points. So as we look forward, when you look at a Steph Curry shoe or you look at a Kyrie Irving shoe, you start to see a little bit more variance in those prices, and I expect that's what we'll see along the way. Our vendors do a great job of introducing a silhouette at a price level and then continuing to lever that up a bit as they add more excitement, whether it be finishes, whether it be textures, whatever, that the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more for.

And then maybe tie into that -- and this is kind of my second question. Can you just help us sort of understand the -- how the ASP and blend of sort of slowing basketball versus strong casual and running works? Meaning how do you keep the momentum in the average selling price growth in casual and running moving forward as basketball slows?"

The -- I think Q1, Robby, is a function of -- we talked about some of the slowdown in February being driven by tax situation and a really robust All-Star game from last year. Those things were both neutralized going into the rest of the quarter. We've seen -- obviously seen the product flow, and we understand what the product engines are going to deliver over the remainder of the first quarter. So there's -- I'm very confident that mid-single digits is where we'll drive the quarter. We'll reaccelerate to the pace that we were at, I believe, before we came across the All-Star game comp, specifically. 
So -- and as it relates to ASPs, again, ASPs are influenced by a lot of things. Part of it is the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Part of it is our ability to sell full-priced goods by having them in the right store at the right time in the right size so that the customer is happy. Part of it is driven by our ability to leverage our cross-channel efforts to make sure that we have the ability to sell the last unit that's available in our entire fleet, and those efforts all contribute to an ASP build. I've mentioned -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about our Timberland business, for example. Timberland 6-inch wheat boot is exactly the same cost to some of the marquee basketball shoes. The Air Force 1 Flyknit shoe is in the same range as some of the signature basketball shoes. As we continue to model the portfolio from the full range of price points and values that the customer sees, we're confident that ASPs will continue to grow. It's really -- if you take one specific segment, one specific category launch or signature basketball, you don't get a true model of what the portfolio looks like. But when you start to take $100 shoes that become $110 shoes, that also has a positive impact on our ASPs. You take a look at not having to mark down a bunch of shoes that, historically, we may have had to mark down prior to the good inventory work that the team's done and the productivity gains that we've seen. So with all of the variables in the pricing model, we're confident that ASPs will continue to rise as the -- as our vendor partners continue to bring great innovative products into the marketplace."

The apparel element as well. We described that apparel margins, while they improved significantly in the quarter, are still running behind footwear, and we really think that when we get to the place where we're at the top of our game in apparel, that those margins will be meaningfully ahead of footwear. So that's an opportunity for us. And Dick described making that last unit of inventory available no matter where it is in the system, is another thing that helps us with getting more value out of each and every unit. That helps the margin. So with the breadth of things that we're working on, we continue to think that we've got opportunity there.

So yes, it's all of those things, right? Our DTC, we're continuing to invest across all channels. So certainly, our online and digital business, we engage with our consumer there. We tell great stories. We want them to start their morning and end their night with one of our band -- brand banners on their digital device. We also know that the consumer likes to still touch product and see product and have an immediacy of being able to get that great new release product. So the stores become realistically the only place that you can have it now when it releases. So as we continue to invest with our vendor partners to create more exciting places to shop in the malls, as we continue to find better location in malls, as we continue to rightsize properties and drive productivity, those things, we believe, are all defensible. Our service model, we think, is defensible. We've got the best fleet of people across our portfolio to take care of customers. They are the resident experts. People come in and look to our stripers in the Foot Locker doors as the sneaker expert. Our customers come in and want to talk about releases. They want to talk about what happened in the game last night and do you think the Kobe shoe will be retro-ed and all of those things. So that, we believe, both from a physical engagement in the store and a digital engagement, we think those things are all defensible. And obviously, the wholesale part of our vendors' business is still the much bigger chunk of our vendors' business. So the fact that they are willing to continue to invest with us -- jointly invest with us, walk out and say loudly, ""We opened up 40-plus properties last year that we partnered with our vendors on,"" we continue to see that opportunity going forward. So the consumer likes choice, and I know that on the digital device, choice is only a click away. But they sometimes like to look at that wall and say, ""Hey, that's really cool. That's really cool."" And we've got some exclusive product that's only available within the Foot Locker family. So those things all create defensible positions, I think, Eric."

She expects all of the product to have performance attributes and perform regardless of whether she's in a spin class, she's out for a run, she's doing yoga, it doesn't make any difference. She knows that the product that's going to be in SIX:02 is going to have performance characteristics. But she's also very, very informed about style and wants to be looking different, looking good in her classes, going out after class for a juice or coffee. Whatever happens to be, she wants to have that style quotient invested as well. So we use the word fashion. I would compound that by saying it's really more style and making sure that it's not about necessarily being the ripped hard body. It's more about looking great as I do things. 
And we're working with our vendor partners, and we've seen some success. The ALALA and Koral product that we brought in that has a little more style quotient to it has performed well. On the footwear side, we've seen the connectivity with Rihanna on the PUMA Creeper and the Fenty product that's launching, I think, today, very well-received by the consumer. So it's more style than fashion, Eric, but something that I think we probably didn't have enough of in our early rendition. So as we get the product assortment right, the vendor assortment right, again, our confidence level is high on SIX:02. But the other reason for slowing, and we talked about it in the prepared remarks, but we're going to have really pinnacle spaces in Manhattan for SIX:02 that we have not had up to this point. SIX:02 will have a store inside a store, if you will, of our flagship locations here on 34th Street come April and up on Times Square later in the year. And that's a really big effort because those stores will really be the face of the brand for a lot of our industry, and we're excited about those opportunities.

And once we feel like we've got all of the elements in place, there will be an aha moment from a brand campaign point of view. We started out by trying to grow the brand more from a grassroots point of view, smaller, local events. And as we get the confidence that we've got this formula right, there will be a bigger opportunity for an aha moment, and it will tie in the flagship stores here. It will tie in the 30 doors that we've got around the country, and it will certainly tie in our digital space that will be relaunched this year. So again, it's a work in progress.

Thank you for joining us today for the first earnings call from our brand-new office at 330 West 34 St. It's been an exciting transition the last few weeks.
We reported in this morning's press release that the company achieved record net income of $191 million in the quarter, up of from $184 million in the first quarter of last year. On a per share basis, Foot Locker earned $1.39 this year, an 8% increase compared to $1.29 earned in the same period in 2015. It was the highest quarterly net income and EPS results in the company's history, a significant achievement, especially in today's challenging retail environment.
We achieve a comparable sales gain of 2.9% in the quarter. Although this result was a shade below the range of our expectations going into the quarter for a mid-single-digit increase, these sales and profits do represent the 25th consecutive quarter of meaningful growth for Foot Locker.
In order to leave as much time as possible for your questions, let me hand the call to Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to review the results of the quarter in more detail.

That said, we have set the bar even higher than we achieved. 
So let's begin to what worked well and where we fell a bit short. First, the cadence of our comparable sales was fairly steady during the quarter with the gain landing, as expected, in the mid-single-digit range in February. But it was up low single digits in March and April, short of our mid-single-digit plan gain. The strong diversity of our assortments and their leadership positions we have in many product categories enabled us to post that 2.9% comp been despite basketball footwear being down mid-single digit. In fact, total company footwear comps were up mid-single digits in the quarter with strength in lifestyle running and classic style more than offsetting the decline in basketball shoe sale. 
Apparel posted a low single digit gain while accessories were down high single digit, primarily the result of the challenging trend in socks. Proving that with the right product, basketball still perform very well come, our strongest division this quarter with Foot Locker Canada with the comparable sales gain in the high teens. This result was fueled by a strong double-digit gain in basketball footwear. Although the gain was initially propelled by the All-Star game in Toronto this year, Canada's strong double-digit performance was sustained throughout the quarter and there were meaningful sales gains across the country, not just in Toronto. 
Our next strongest store division was Foot Locker Europe, which turned in high single-digit comparable sales gain on top of last year's double-digit gain. On the other side of the ledger, Runners Point and Sidestep continue to face assortment challenges with sales in both banners down double digit from a year ago. 
To round out our international division. Foot Locker Asia Pacific continued its high level of performance turning in a strong mid-single-digit sales gain on top of last year's gain in the teen. Turning to our U.S. story divisions. Champs Sports led the way with the mid-single digit comparable sales increase. Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and our women's division, Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up low single digit. Footaction posted a comp loss in the high single digits. There were 2 primary elements of Footaction's underperformance in the quarter. 
First, it has a relatively high penetration of basketball compared to other banners and second, it doesn't offer women's footwear, which has been quite a strong contributor to our other banners recently. In fact, for the quarter, women's comparable footwear sales were up mid-single digits while our sales of kid's footwear across the banners that sell children's product was even stronger, up high single digits. Sales of men's footwear were down slightly.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid performance with an overall comparable sales gain of 7.3%. Sales of our store banner dot-com businesses, including both domestic and international banners increased more than 20% on top of last year's almost 40% increase.
Eastbay on the other hand declined mid-single digit. The story of Eastbay which caters to the elite high school athlete remains similar to last quarter, with core performance shoes and apparel trending down relative to the casual assortments in which our store banners has a stronger position. 
Our gross margin rate was flat in the quarter, with 30 basis points of merchandise margin improvement offset by slight occupancy deleverage and higher shipping and handling expense. As we noted in our previous call, we need to comp at least in the low end of mid-single to leverage occupancy, and we sell just sort of that in the quarter. The uptick in merchandise margin was fairly consistent across footwear, apparel and accessories, driven by lower markdowns.
As expected, our SG&A rate delevered slightly to 18.2% of sales in the first quarter, largely due to incurring almost $4 million of expenses related to the move into our exciting new office space. 
Without the move cost, our SG&A rate would have held flat at 18%, thanks to the excellent work of our expense management team. Depreciation expense increased to $39 million from $35 million in Q1. Reflecting the company's ongoing investments in enhancing and aligning the customer experience across all of our channel, stores, digital, mobile and social media. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 36%, slightly below our expected run rate of 36.5%. Relative to plan, our mix of income in the quarter came proportionately more from Europe, where our tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The record net income we reported for the quarter also led to strong cash flow. And we finished the quarter with $1,062 million in cash. The first quarter typically represents our peak cash position with balances subsequently declining until we reached the year-end holiday selling period. 
Over time, the proportion of our cash held overseas has grown relative to cash in the U.S. And just this week, we closed on a $400 million credit facility come up from $200 million before. The new and expanded facility allows us to maintain our liquidity in the U.S., while continuing to invest in our U.S. store fleet and our digital and mobile platform as well as actively repurchasing shares, funding our dividend program and being prepared for other opportunities or challenges.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.37 million shares for $87.8 million. We spent approximately $65 million of capital as we continue to track towards our planned expenditures this year of $297 million. 
An important part of our capital spending this year is to elevate 2 of our flagship stores here in midtown Manhattan, both the 34th Street store below our former office and the Foot Locker store in Times Square, close during the first quarter. 
Our exciting new Times Square store will not open until the holiday. The 34th Street store is slated to reopen back to school, but it will be closed during all of Q2, and the lost sales from that high-volume store are enough to reduce our overall comp a few ticks in the current quarter. 
Inventory increased to 2.1% at the end of Q1, slightly above our target given the 3.9% sales increase on a constant currency basis. Our inventory remains fresh and productive with turns continuing to tick up towards our long-range goal. Most importantly, we believe our inventory position supports the mid-single digit sales gain with primarily full price selling that we continue to plan for over the balance of the year. We continue to believe we can achieve a mid-single digit comp for the full year as well as double-digit EPS growth, with 10 to 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. We believe that this performance is also achievable in each of the remaining quarters, including this one. 
As we expected, comp sales are running down month-to-date, but were once again on the negative side of a very significant launch shift. One of the more powerful Jordan releases of this entire year is coming next weekend. Whereas, last year, a similarly strong Jordan release had already happen by this time in the month. Over such a short period of 3 weeks, the impact of this launch definitely has the potential to lift our May comp well into positive territory. 
That said, Q2 is already the lowest volume quarter of the year and this year, we have 2 of our very tough stores closed. So SG&A leverage will again be a challenge in the quarter. As always, we will manage the business tightly, not just SG&A but also inventory and occupancy to maximize our profits this quarter and position ourselves for strong second half of the year. 
Let me hand the call to Dick now to cover the product highlights in more depth and discuss how we see the industry and our business shaping up over the balance of the year."

I want to start my remarks today by thanking everyone on the Foot Locker Inc. team by producing our best, most profitable quarter ever. As you can tell from Lawrence remarks, there was a lot going on this quarter, with some fast-moving product category shifts, big events like the All-Star game in Toronto, the temporary closure of 2 of our biggest volume stores here in Midtown Manhattan and, of course, packing everyone up and moving into our brand-new offices. 
Although you may hear in the background that we've brought some of the sirens with us. With all that, we maintain our focus on execution and produced our strongest quarter quarterly results ever and added another quarter to our streak of consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit increases. My sincere thanks to all the associates at Foot Locker who made it possible.
It is only because of the diligent work of the last several years to build and strengthen the diversity of our business in terms of product categories, geographies, families of business and channels that we were able to post a solid comparable sales gain for the quarter in the phase of a mid-single-digit decline in basketball. Although we have planned basketball to be off, the category ended up a bit softer than we had expected, which is the primary reason our quarterly comp gain came in somewhat below our guidance. 
The basketball business, like all our other categories, thrives on newness and innovation, and where that was apparent, our basketball business remains strong. The Jordan Brand continues to innovate and produce excellent results with the Sportswear side of that brand giving the biggest dollar gains. 
In fact, John here has finally put away his low-profile Kobe's for a really cool pair of Jordan Horizon he brought up from our Hoop store in London. The casual portion of basketball outside of Jordan was also strong, led by model, such as Superstars play adi as well and Air Force 1's from Nike. It was the signature side of the basketball business that saw the biggest decline. Although we saw important elements of excitement. For example, the Stephen Curry shoes from Under Armour and the Kyrie Irvin shoes from Nike both posted big gains. Meanwhile, Kobe sales hang in pretty well in the quarter likely influenced the buzz around his retirement. 
The primary losses came in, Lebron and KD product, a challenge, which we've been addressing with our partners at Nike. Between Nike resetting the price value relationship of many of its shoes and focusing their incredible innovation engine, along with the strap that Under Armour and potential momentum in adidas, we are confident that by the back half of the year, there will be in place all the elements of a more robust, diverse signature basketball business. 
In the meantime, our leadership positions in footwear categories other than signature basketball enabled us to successfully people of much of our inventory position into these areas in Q1. Lifestyle running footwear was an especially good business in the quarter, with the Roshe and styles from Nike and [indiscernible] continuing to be popular sellers. 
Category hit and newness was driven by the Nomad and Boost products from adidas. The Stan Smiths shoe from adidas is another perfect example of a leadership position we have an area other than basketball, in this case, classic court shoes. This leading position can be seen in the depth of our buys and in the variety of different model executions we sell. Quite a few of which are exclusive. We enjoy a significant number of special makeup styles not just in Stan Smith's but also in Superstars, PUMA Suede and various other casual, yet premium products. In retrospect, demands for this special product outstripped supply giving us confidence in the emphasis of our merchandise position over the next several months. 
The very strong adi Originals business is also an excellent example of our advantage in our global footprint. Since the trend started in Europe where our merchants recognize the excitement early and shared their initial success with our U.S. teams before it exploded into a worldwide phenomenon. 
Even with the partial shift outside of signature basket, our customers still expect to find and are finding premium sneakers in our stores and on our digital sites. Sneakers for which they are willing to pay premium prices. This led to higher footwear units and average selling prices in the quarter with both up low single digits. 
On the apparel side, ASP were up even more in the mid-single-digit range, driven primarily by lower Mark pounds. Although apparel units were down low single digits, for the most part, I describe our men's apparel business as improving, especially in Europe. Overall, profitability is up both in dollars and rate, which, as I said last quarter, is a great place to start. We're still working on driving more apparel volume in each of our banners, and the investment in our store and model programs continues to be an important element of our strategy to elevate the storytelling around the premium, special products our vendors are beginning to deliver. 
On the women's side, apparel comps were down as the Lady Foot Locker and especially the SIX:02 customer has almost completely shifted of athletic performance silhouettes into athletic lifestyle. Adi, Nike and PUMA, all had some exciting celebrity driven assortments, but the quantities weren't enough to offset the decline in the sales of performance products from a year ago. 
Meanwhile, the overall women's business is being driven by footwear where the Superstars, Stan Smith and Nike casual running trends are even stronger for her than they are for the man. Another clear indication of the ongoing strength of the sneaker trend is the traffic was positive in the quarter, up low single digits both in the U.S. and overall. Fortunately, kids love to touch, feel and try on sneakers and they love to compare and shop together for the latest and greatest athletic footwear and apparel. Two exceptions to the good traffic trends though were Runners Point and Sidestep in Germany were traffic was down double digits. Even for the Foot Locker banner in Europe, Germany was the most difficult of the large countries and German retail in general has been a bit tough lately. 
With that said, we have active opportunity to improve the performance in Runners Point and Sidestep and it starts with driving more traffic through a combination of more elevated in-store experience, targeted marketing and most importantly, improved and better diversified product assortments. 
We've done a lot of work to better define the core customers of the these 2 banners and the results have helped us in the discussions with our vendors to create this sort of special focused assortments that really motivate these customers. 
At this point, there hasn't been enough product depth to stem the comp declines, but our inventory position remains sufficiently clean to enable us we believe to get this banners back on track as the year progresses. 
Turning to our digital business. The growth in our store banners.com continues to be strong, although not at the same pace as a year ago. We continue to invest in the technological infrastructure behind our digital sites and enrich the content on the customer-facing side. Perhaps most importantly, we're rethinking our approach to our channels. As I've in Burma, our Chief Information Officer recently described, the concept of a channel doesn't really exist for our customers come only the relationships they have with our brands. Thus our capital spend is now more consistently based on strengthening the relationship across all of our sales channels. 
A good example of the return on that investment can be seen in our expanding sales, buy online, ship from store. Already available across our domestic than ours, we rolled it out in the U.K. in the first quarter and Foot Locker expanded on to the European continent in future quarters. The softest part of our digital business right now is Eastbay, which as Laura described, is really focused on the serious high school athlete the it to casual and lifestyle silhouettes and slightly declining rate of youth participation in certain sports, such as football have hindered is based top line recently. While is, please merchants are shifting a portion of their assortments more in the direction of lifestyle, we have tentative truth of the performance heritage and identity of these Eastbay banner. We're working to enhance our current customers digital experience and increase brand awareness at younger ages. 
The goal is to expand the pipeline of kids who know and love the Eastbay brand as they pursue their passion first sports. Examples of success already include the growth in our training and girls volleyball businesses. 
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the record-setting performance of our team this quarter. We challenge ourselves everyday to be high-performing organization. Sometimes, circumstances don't allow us to clear the buyer by as much as we'd like to but with the long-term trends towards casualization and active lifestyles firmly intact, the athletic footwear and apparel industry is an exciting space to be in. 
We've got a great team of associates and a great lineup of vendor partners. And together, we have many tremendous opportunities to grow and improve Foot Locker's business as we work to achieve the long-term goals we outlined last year. 
Carlos, let's please open up the call for questions now."

Our team has done a really good job of shifting the inventory into some of the cash will businesses that we talked about in our prepared remarks and the launch cadence for the rest of the quarter lines up really favorably for us.

She is a very discerning shopper, she expects the performance characteristics to be built in, but she's also looking forward to be very fashionable. We have seen success with some of the Rihanna product that launched that, that asset-driven model with a great-looking product that she can use in the gym or in her active lifestyles is really helping drive that business. And we're shifting, we're up against the performance silhouettes from last year, bigger numbers. So as she changes and our inventory changes with her, that will certainly be a contributor. Apparel in general, as I said, is getting better. The Europe team is leading that effort. Their apparel business was up nicely. Apparel is getting better at Champs and the Kids Foot Locker and solidify its position at Foot Locker. So we've got secondly, some upside on the apparel front. The categories that we mentioned, some of the classic sneakers, some of the lifestyle-running shoes, again, our inventories shifting appropriately so we see great opportunity there. Our inventory is clean and fresh. So we'll be able to our markdowns through the quarter is and so that really is what's going to improve sales and the margin opportunity, Michael. As far as Runners Point, we've got a traffic issue there, retail in Germany has been a little bit tough for all of our banners, including actually all of the segment. But, I think, as I've talked about, we've done the deep dive on our customers and the Runners Point of outdoors, we continue to shift the inventory there, get the inventory properly positioned. And it goes back to fiery customers when we took out the vulcanized product and new boots and relaunching, if you will, are running only shop on the High Street with a Runners Point, making sure we get all of the inventory right. So the the effort in the short term is to drive traffic. Once they get into the story, we're able to convert them because we've got the great salesperson and a great team on the store floor there. But again, we've got to get some traffic in the doors."

So again, I think, the consumer as we've shown in a specific shoes, the consumer in Canada certainly didn't have any issues around signature basketball that led to the All-Star game. So when there's excitement around the product, when there's innovation around the product and when the price volume relationship is right for the kid, the category is fine, and we expect that in the back half we'd some of the things that lives in coming down the product pipeline. So again, the kid is very discerning and signature basket was one of his choice us but the strength that we've added to our portfolio across the casual sneakers, the Boost product from adidas.

But we also think that the customer is very flexible in their foot covering choices, their sneaker choices these days. So wherever there's a cool sneaker, they're going to find it at Foot Locker and they're going to choose the category. They don't -- it's a little bit like they're not thinking about channels didn't really think about categories that much. They're think about coolness and if the sneakers got the cool factor for whatever they want to do, that's the sneaker that they'll buy. So again, we see strength, we have certain level of exclusives across all categories. But one of the real advantages we've got and we've called it out in our prepared remarks is that we see things happening all around the globe. So our European business maybe on something quicker than our U.S. business or quicker than our vendor partners bring it to the U.S. marketplace. It's one of the things that happened with this great turn we've seen with adidas. Our European team called it out. Our U.S. was able to get on some of the sneakers sooner than we probably would have had we not had that European business. So again, the strength of the portfolio goes across categories, it goes across geographies, it goes across contact points with the consumer. And I guess your last question on is there enough of the hot product in the marketplace? There's never enough of the hot product in the marketplace and that's what the scarcity model is all about. So we see, I mean, you all saw the adidas results, a you see the Under Armour results, you know that they're having success. Would we want some more of their key products? Absolutely.

Thank you for joining us today for the first earnings call from our brand new offices at 330 West 34th Street. It's been an exciting transition in the last few weeks.
We reported in this morning's press release that the company achieved record net income of $191 million in the quarter, up from $184 million in the first quarter last year. On a per share basis, Foot Locker earned $1.39 this year, an 8% increase compared to the $1.29 earned in the same period in 2015. It was the highest quarterly net income and EPS results in the company's history, a significant achievement, especially in today's challenging retail environment.
We achieved a comparable sales gain of 2.9% in the quarter. Although this result was a shade below the range of our expectation going into the quarter for a mid-single-digit increase, these sales and profits do represent the 25th consecutive quarter of meaningful growth for Foot Locker.
In order to leave as much time as possible for your questions, let me hand the call right away to Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to review the results of the quarter in more detail.

That said, we have set the bar even higher than we achieved. 
So let's begin to what worked well and where we fell a bit short. First, the cadence of our comparable sales was fairly steady during the quarter, with the gain landing as expected in the mid-single-digit range in February. But it was up low single digits in March and April, short of our mid-single-digit planned gain. The strong diversity of our assortments and the leadership positions we have in many product categories enabled us to post that 2.9% comp gain despite basketball footwear being down mid-single digits. In fact, total company footwear comps were up mid-single digits in the quarter, with strength in lifestyle running and classic style more than offsetting the decline in basketball shoe sale.
Apparel posted a low single-digit gain, while accessories were down high single digit, primarily the result of the challenging trend in socks. Proving that with the right product, basketball still performs very well come, our strongest division this quarter with Foot Locker Canada with the comparable sales gain in the high-teens. This result was fueled by a strong double-digit gain in basketball footwear. Although the gain was initially propelled by the All-Star game in Toronto this year, Canada's strong double-digit performance was sustained throughout the quarter, and there were meaningful sales gains across the country, not just in Toronto.
Our next strongest store division was Foot Locker Europe, which turned in high single-digit comparable sales gain on top of last year's double-digit gain. 
On the other side of the ledger, Runners Point and Sidestep continue to face assortment challenges, with sales in both banners down double digit from a year ago.
To round out our international division. Foot Locker Asia Pacific continued its high level of performance turning in a strong mid-single-digit sales gain on top of last year's gain in the teen. 
Turning to our U.S. store divisions. Champs Sports led the way with a mid-single digit comparable sales increase. Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and our women's division, Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up low single digit. Footaction posted a comp loss in the high single digits. 
There were 2 primary elements of Footaction's underperformance in the quarter.  First, it has a relatively high penetration of basketball compared to other banners. And second, it doesn't offer women's footwear, which has been quite a strong contributor to our other banners recently. In fact, for the quarter, women's comparable footwear sales were up mid-single digits, while our sales of kid's footwear across the banners that sell children's product was even stronger, up high single digits. Sales of men's footwear were down slightly.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid performance, with an overall comparable sales gain of 7.3%. Sales of our store banner. com businesses, including both domestic and international banners, increased more than 20% on top of last year's almost 40% increase.
Eastbay on the other hand declined mid-single digit. The story of Eastbay which caters to the elite high school athlete remains similar to last quarter, with core performance shoes and apparel trending down relative to the casual assortments in which our store banner site have a stronger position. 
Our gross margin rate was flat in the quarter with 30 basis points of merchandise margin improvement,t offset by slight occupancy deleverage and higher shipping and handling expense. As we noted on our previous call, we need to comp at least in the low end of mid singles to leverage occupancy, and we sell just short of that this quarter. The uptick in merchandise margin was fairly consistent across footwear, apparel and accessories, driven by lower markdowns.
As expected, our SG&A rate delevered slightly to 18.2% of sales in the first quarter, largely due to incurring almost $4 million of expenses related to the move into our exciting new office space.
Without the move costs, our SG&A rate would have held flat at 18%, thanks to the excellent work of our expense management team. Depreciation expense increased to $39 million from $35 million in Q1, reflecting the company's ongoing investments in enhancing and aligning the customer experience across all of our channel: stores, digital, mobile and social media. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 36%, slightly below our expected run rate of 36.5%. Relative to plan, our mix of income in the quarter came proportionately more from Europe, where our tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The record net income we reported for the quarter also led to strong cash flow, and we finished the quarter with $1,062 million in cash. The first quarter typically represents our peak cash position, with balances subsequently declining until we reached the year-end holiday selling period.
Over time, the proportion of our cash held overseas has grown relative to cash in the U.S. And just this week, we closed on a new $400 million credit facility up from $200 million before. The new expanded facility allows us to maintain our liquidity in the U.S. while continuing to invest in our U.S. store fleet and our digital and mobile platform as well as actively repurchasing shares, funding our dividend program and being prepared for other opportunities or challenges.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.37 million shares for $87.8 million. We spent approximately $65 million of capital as we continue to track towards our planned expenditures this year of $297 million.
An important part of our capital spending this year is to elevate 2 of our flagship stores here in Midtown Manhattan, both the 34th Street store below our former office and the Foot Locker store in Times Square closed during the first quarter. 
Our exciting new Times Square store will not open until the holiday. The 34th Street store is slated to reopen for back-to-school, but it will be closed during all of Q2, and the lost sales from that high-volume store are enough to reduce our overall comp a few ticks in the current quarter.
Inventory increased 2.1% at the end of Q1, slightly above our target, given the 3.9% sales increase on a constant currency basis. Our inventory remains fresh and productive with turns continuing to tick up towards our long-range goal. Most importantly, we believe our inventory position supports the mid-single-digit sales gain with primarily full price selling that we continue to plan for over the balance of the year. We continue to believe we can achieve a mid-single digit comp for the full year as well as double-digit EPS growth with 10 to 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. We believe that this performance is also achievable in each of the remaining quarters, including this one.
As we expected, comp sales are running down month-to-date, but were once again on the negative side of a very significant launch shift. One of the more powerful Jordan releases of this entire year is coming next weekend. Whereas, last year, a similarly strong Jordan release had already happened by this time in the month. Over such a short period of 3 weeks, the impact of this launch definitely has the potential to lift our May comp well into positive territory.
That said, Q2 is already the lowest volume quarter of the year, and this year, we have 2 of our very tough stores closed. So SG&A leverage will again be a challenge in the quarter. As always, we will manage the business tightly, not just SG&A but also inventory and occupancy to maximize our profits this quarter and position ourselves for strong second half of the year.
Let me hand the call to Dick now to cover the product highlights in more depth and discuss how we see the industry and our business shaping up over the balance of the year."

I want to start my remarks today by thanking everyone on the Foot Locker, Inc. team for producing our best, most profitable quarter ever. As you could tell from Lauren's remarks, there was a lot going on in this quarter with some fast-moving product category shifts, big events like the All-Star game in Toronto, the temporary closure of 2 of our biggest volume stores here in Midtown Manhattan, and of course, packing everyone up and moving into our brand new offices.
Although you may hear in the background that we've brought some of the sirens with us. With all that, we maintains our focus on execution and produced our strongest quarterly results ever and added another quarter to our streak of consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit increases. My sincere thanks to all the associates at Foot Locker who made it possible.
It is only because of the diligent work of the last several years to build and strengthen the diversity of our business in terms of product categories, geographies, families of business and channels that we were able to post a solid comparable sales gain for the quarter in the phase of a mid-single-digit decline in basketball. Although we have planned basketball to be off, the category ended up a bit softer than we had expected, which is the primary reason our quarterly comp gain came in somewhat below our guidance.
The basketball business, like all our other categories, thrives on newness and innovation, and where that was apparent, our basketball business remains strong. The Jordan Brand continues to innovate and produce excellent results, with the Sportswear side of that brand giving the biggest dollar gains.
In fact, John here has finally put away his low-profile Kobe's for a really cool pair of Jordan Horizons he brought back from our House of Hoops store in London. The casual portion of basketball, outside of Jordan, was also strong led by models, such as Superstars by adi as well as Foamposites and Air Force 1s from Nike. It was the signature side of the basketball business that saw the biggest decline. Although even here we saw important elements of excitement. For example, the Stephen Curry shoes from Under Armour and the Kyrie Irving shoes from Nike both posted big gains. Meanwhile, Kobe's sales hung in pretty well in the quarter likely influenced by the buzz around his retirement.
The primary losses came in LeBron and KD product, a challenge, which we've been addressing with our partners at Nike. Between Nike resetting the price value relationship of many of its shoes and focusing their incredible innovation engine, along with the strength of the Under Armour and potential momentum in adidas, we are confident that by the back half of the year, there will be in place all the elements of a more robust, diverse signature basketball business.
In the meantime, our leadership positions in footwear categories other than signature basketball enabled us to successfully pivot much of our inventory position into these areas in Q1. Lifestyle running footwear was an especially good business in the quarter, with the Roshe and Huarache styles from Nike and ZX Flux from adi continuing to be popular sellers.
Category heat and newness was driven by the Nomad and Boost products from adidas. The Stan Smith shoe from adidas is another perfect example of a leadership position we have in an area other than basketball, in this case, classic court shoes. This leading position can be seen in the depth of our buys and in the variety of different model executions we sell, quite a few of which are exclusive. We enjoy a significant number of special makeup styles not just in Stan Smith's but also in Superstars, PUMA Suede and various other casual, yet premium products. In retrospect, demands for this special product outstripped supply, giving us confidence in the emphasis of our merchandise position over the next several months.
The very strong adi Originals business is also an excellent example of the advantage of our global footprint. Since the trend started in Europe where our merchants recognize the excitement early and shared their initial success with our U.S. teams before it exploded into a worldwide phenomenon.
Even with the partial shift out of signature basket, our customers still expect to find and are finding premium sneakers in our stores and on our digital sites. Sneakers for which they are willing to pay premium prices. This led to higher footwear units and average selling prices in the quarter with both up low single digits.
On the apparel side, ASPs were up even more in the mid-single-digit range, driven primarily by lower markdowns. Although apparel units were down low single digits, for the most part, I describe our men's apparel business as improving, especially in Europe. Overall, profitability is up, both in dollars and rate, which as I said last quarter, is a great place to start. We're still working on driving more apparel volume in each of our banners, and the investment in our store remodel programs continues to be an important element of our strategy to elevate the storytelling around the premium special products our vendors are beginning to deliver.
On the women's side, apparel comps were down as the Lady Foot Locker and especially the SIX:02 customer has almost completely shifted off athletic performance silhouettes into athletic lifestyle. Adi, Nike and PUMA, all have some exciting celebrity- driven assortments, but the quantities weren't enough to offset the decline in the sales of performance products from a year ago.
Meanwhile, the overall women's business is being driven by footwear where the Superstar, Stan Smith and Nike casual running trends are even stronger for her than they are for the men. Another clear indication of the ongoing strength of the sneaker trend is that traffic was positive in the quarter, up low single digits, both in the U.S. and overall. Fortunately, kids love to touch, feel and try on sneakers and they love to compare and shop together for the latest and greatest athletic footwear and apparel. Two exceptions to the good traffic trends, though, were Runners Point and Sidestep in Germany where traffic was down double digits. Even for the Foot Locker banner in Europe, Germany was the most difficult of the large countries, and German retail, in general, has been a bit tough lately.
That said, we have plenty of opportunity to improve the performance in Runners Point and Sidestep, and it starts with driving more traffic through a combination of more elevated in-store experience, targeted marketing and most importantly, improved and better diversified product assortments.
We've done a lot of work to better define the core customers of these 2 banners, and the results have helped us in the discussions with our vendors to create this sort of special focused assortments that really motivate these customers.
At this point, there hasn't been enough product depth to stem the comp declines, but our inventory position remains sufficiently clean to enable us we believe to get these banners back on track as the year progresses. 
Turning to our digital business. The growth in our store banner.com continues to be strong, although not at the same pace as a year ago. We continue to invest in the technological infrastructure behind our digital sites and enrich the content on the customer-facing side. Perhaps most importantly, we're rethinking our approach to our channels. As Pawan Verma, our Chief Information Officer, recently described the concept of a channel doesn't really exist for our customers, only the relationships they have with our brand. Thus our capital spending is now more consistently based on strengthening that relationship across all of our sales channels.
A good example of the return on that investment can be seen in our expanding boss sales, buy online, ship-from-store. Already available across our domestic banners, we rolled it out in the U.K. in the first quarter and plan to expand it on to the European continent in future quarters. The softest part of our digital business right now is Eastbay, which as Lauren described, is really focused on the serious high school athlete. The shift to casual and lifestyle silhouettes and a slightly declining rate of youth participation in certain sports, such as football, have hindered Eastbay's top line recently. While Eastbay's merchants are shifting a portion of their assortments more in the direction of lifestyle, we attempt to keep true to the performance heritage and identity of the Eastbay banner. We're working to enhance our current customers' digital experience and increase brand awareness at younger ages.
The goal is to expand the pipeline of kids who know and love the Eastbay brand as they pursue their passion for sports. Examples of success already include the growth in our training and girls volleyball businesses.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the record-setting performance of our team this quarter. We challenge ourselves every day to be high-performing organization. Sometimes, circumstances don't allow us to clear the buyer by as much as we'd like to, but with the long-term trends towards casualization and active lifestyles firmly intact, the athletic footwear and apparel industry is an exciting space to be in.
We've got a great team of associates and a great lineup of vendor partners. And together, we have many tremendous opportunities to grow and improve Foot Locker's business, as we work to achieve the long-term goals we outlined last year.
Carlos, let's please open up the call for questions now."

Our team has done a really good job of shifting the inventory into some of the casual businesses that we talked about in our prepared remarks, and the launch cadence for the rest of the quarter lines up really favorably for us. So certainly, the mid-single digits that Lauren talked about and I talked about in our comments are attainable in the quarter, Michael."

She is a very discerning shopper. She expects the performance characteristics to be built in, but she's also looking forward to be very fashionable. We've seen success with some of the Rihanna product that's launched, that asset-driven model with great looking product that she can use in the gym or in her active lifestyle is really helping drive that business. And we're shifting, we're up against big performance silhouettes from last year, bigger numbers. So as she changes and our inventory changes with her, that will certainly be a contributor. Apparel, in general, as I said, is getting better. The Europe team is leading that effort. Their apparel business was up nicely. Apparel is getting better at Champs and the Kids Foot Locker and solidifying its position at Foot Locker. So we've got certainly some upside on the apparel front. The categories that we mentioned, some of the classic sneakers, some of the lifestyle running shoes, again, our inventories shifting appropriately. So we see great opportunity there. Our inventory is clean and fresh. So we'll be able to our markdowns through the quarters, and so that really is what's going to improve sales and the margin opportunity, Michael. As far as Runners Point, we've got a traffic issue there. Retail in Germany has been a little bit tough for all of our banners, including, actually, all of the segment. But, I think, as I talked about, we've done the deep dive on our customers and the Runners Point and Sidestep doors, we continue to shift the inventory there, get the inventory properly positioned. And it goes back to firing customers when we took out the vulcanized product in the boots and relaunching, if you will, are running only shop on the High Street with Runners Point, making sure we get all of the inventory right. So the effort in the short term is to drive traffic. Once they get in the story, we're able to convert them because we've got a great salesperson and a great team on the store floor there. But again, we've got to get some traffic in the doors."

So again, I think the consumer, as we've shown in specific shoes, the consumer in Canada certainly didn't have any issues around signature basketball that led into the All-Star game. So when there's excitement around the product, when there's innovation around the product and when the price value relationship is right for the kid, the category is fine. And we expect that in the back half with some of the things we've seen coming down the product pipeline. So again, the kid is very discerning and signature basketball is one of his choices. But the strength that we've added to our portfolio across the casual sneakers, the Boost product from adidas, there's tremendous opportunity in all of our categories. And that's why the work we've gone over the last few years to really build this portfolio of businesses allows us to absorb a little bit of a body blow on the signature basketball side and still drive a successful winning business."

The challenge that we faced was really around the 2 athletes, LeBron and KD where the kid just didn't see the price value relationship in those offerings in the quarter that they've seen in the past.

So we think that the basketball trend line improves, but we also think that the customer is very flexible in their foot covering choices, their sneaker choices these days. So wherever there's a cool sneaker, they're going to find it at Foot Locker, and they're going to choose the category. They don't -- it's a little bit like them not thinking about channels. They don't really think about categories that much. They think about coolness, and if the sneakers got the cool factor for whatever they want to do, that's the sneaker that they'll buy. So again, we see strength, we have certain level of exclusives across all categories. But one of the real advantages we've got and we've called it out in our prepared remarks is that we see things happening all around the globe. So our European business may beyond something quicker than our U.S. business or quicker than our vendor partners bring it to the U.S. marketplace. It's one of the things that happened with this great turn that we've seen with adidas. Our European team called it out. Our U.S. team was able to get on some of the sneakers sooner than we probably would have had we not had that European business. So again, the strength of the portfolio goes across categories, it goes across geographies, it goes across contact points with the consumer. And I guess your last question on is there enough of the hot product in the marketplace? There's never enough of the hot product in the marketplace, and that's what the scarcity model is all about. So we see -- I mean, you all saw the adidas results, you see the Under Armour results, you know that they're having success. Would we want some more of their key products? Absolutely.

Thank you for joining us today for the first earnings call from our brand new offices at 330 West 34th Street. It's been an exciting transition in the last few weeks.
We reported in this morning's press release that the company achieved record net income of $191 million in the quarter, up from $184 million in the first quarter last year. On a per share basis, Foot Locker earned $1.39 this year, an 8% increase compared to the $1.29 earned in the same period in 2015. It was the highest quarterly net income and EPS results in the company's history, a significant achievement, especially in today's challenging retail environment.
We achieved a comparable sales gain of 2.9% in the quarter. Although this result was a shade below the range of our expectation going into the quarter for a mid-single-digit increase, these sales and profits do represent the 25th consecutive quarter of meaningful growth for Foot Locker.
In order to leave as much time as possible for your questions, let me hand the call straight away to Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to review the results of the quarter in more detail.

That said, we have set the bar even higher than we achieved. 
So let's begin to what worked well and where we fell a bit short. First, the cadence of our comparable sales was fairly steady during the quarter, with the gain landing as expected in the mid-single-digit range in February. But it was up low single digits in March and April, short of our mid-single-digit planned gain. The strong diversity of our assortments and the leadership positions we have in many product categories enabled us to post that 2.9% comp gain despite basketball footwear being down mid-single digits. In fact, total company footwear comps were up mid-single digits in the quarter, with strength in lifestyle running and classic style more than offsetting the decline in basketball shoe sales.
Apparel posted a low single-digit gain, while accessories were down high single digits, primarily the result of the challenging trend in socks. Proving that with the right product, basketball still performs very well, our strongest division this quarter was Foot Locker Canada with the comparable sales gain in the high-teens. This result was fueled by a strong double-digit gain in basketball footwear. Although the gain was initially propelled by the All-Star game in Toronto this year, Canada's strong double-digit performance was sustained throughout the quarter, and there were meaningful sales gains across the country, not just in Toronto.
Our next strongest store division was Foot Locker Europe, which turned in a high single-digit comparable sales gain on top of last year's double-digit gain. 
On the other side of the ledger, Runners Point and Sidestep continue to face assortment challenges, with sales in both banners down double digits from a year ago.
To round out our international division, Foot Locker Asia Pacific continued its high level of performance, turning in a strong mid-single-digit sales gain on top of last year's gain in the teens. 
Turning to our U.S. store divisions. Champs Sports led the way with a mid-single digit comparable sales increase. Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and our women's division, Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up low single digit. Footaction posted a comp loss in the high single digits. 
There were 2 primary elements of Footaction's underperformance in the quarter. First, it has a relatively high penetration of basketball compared to other banners. And second, it doesn't offer women's footwear, which has been quite a strong contributor to our other banners recently. In fact, for the quarter, women's comparable footwear sales were up mid-single digits, while our sales of kid's footwear across the banners that sell children's products was even stronger, up high single digits. Sales of men's footwear were down slightly.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid performance, with an overall comparable sales gain of 7.3%. Sales of our store banner.com businesses, including both domestic and international banners, increased more than 20% on top of last year's almost 40% increase.
Eastbay, on the other hand, declined mid-single digit. The story of Eastbay which caters to the elite high school athlete remains similar to last quarter, with core performance shoes and apparel trending down relative to the casual assortments in which our store banner site have a stronger position. 
Our gross margin rate was flat in the quarter with 30 basis points of merchandise margin improvement offset by slight occupancy deleverage and higher shipping and handling expense. As we noted on our previous call, we need to comp at least in the low end of mid singles to leverage occupancy, and we fell just short of that this quarter. The uptick in merchandise margin was fairly consistent across footwear, apparel and accessories, driven by lower markdowns.
As expected, our SG&A rate delevered slightly to 18.2% of sales in the first quarter, largely due to incurring almost $4 million of expenses related to the move into our exciting new office space.
Without the move costs, our SG&A rate would have held flat at 18%, thanks to the excellent work of our expense management team. Depreciation expense increased to $39 million from $35 million in Q1, reflecting the company's ongoing investments in enhancing and aligning the customer experience across all of our channels: stores, digital, mobile and social media. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 36%, slightly below our expected run rate of 36.5%. Relative to plan, our mix of income in the quarter came proportionately more from Europe, where our tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The record net income we reported for the quarter also led to strong cash flow, and we finished the quarter with $1,062 million in cash. The first quarter typically represents our peak cash position, with balances subsequently declining until we reach the year-end holiday selling period.
Over time, the proportion of our cash held overseas has grown relative to cash in the U.S. And just this week, we closed on a new $400 million credit facility, up from $200 million before. The new expanded facility allows us to maintain our liquidity in the U.S., while continuing to invest in our U.S. store fleet and our digital and mobile platform, as well as actively repurchasing shares, funding our dividend program and being prepared for other opportunities or challenges.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.37 million shares for $87.8 million. We spent approximately $65 million of capital as we continue to track towards our planned expenditures this year of $297 million.
An important part of our capital spending this year is to elevate 2 of our flagship stores here in Midtown Manhattan, both the 34th Street store below our former office and the Foot Locker store in Times Square closed during the first quarter. 
Our exciting new Times Square store will not open until the holiday. The 34th Street store is slated to reopen for back-to-school, but it will be closed during all of Q2, and the lost sales from that high-volume store are enough to reduce our overall comp a few ticks in the current quarter.
Inventory increased 2.1% at the end of Q1, slightly above our target, given the 3.9% sales increase on a constant currency basis. Our inventory remains fresh and productive with turns continuing to tick up towards our long-range goal. Most importantly, we believe our inventory position supports the mid-single-digit sales gain with primarily full price selling that we continue to plan for over the balance of the year. We continue to believe we can achieve a mid-single digit comp for the full year as well as double-digit EPS growth with 10 to 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. We believe that this performance is also achievable in each of the remaining quarters, including this one.
As we expected, comp sales are running down month-to-date, but we're once again on the negative side of a very significant launch shift. One of the more powerful Jordan releases of this entire year is coming next weekend. Whereas, last year, a similarly strong Jordan release had already happened by this time in the month. Over such a short period of 3 weeks, the impact of this launch definitely has the potential to lift our May comp well into positive territory.
That said, Q2 is already the lowest volume quarter of the year, and this year, we have 2 of our very top stores closed. So SG&A leverage will again be a challenge in the quarter. As always, we will manage the business tightly, not just SG&A but also inventory and occupancy to maximize our profits this quarter and position ourselves for a strong second half of the year.
Let me hand the call to Dick now to cover the product highlights in more depth and discuss how we see the industry and our business shaping up over the balance of the year."

As you could tell from Lauren's remarks, there was a lot going on this",1602,"Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks today by thanking everyone on the Foot Locker, Inc. team for producing our best, most profitable quarter ever. As you could tell from Lauren's remarks, there was a lot going on this quarter with some fast-moving product category shifts, big events like the All-Star game in Toronto, the temporary closure of 2 of our biggest volume stores here in Midtown Manhattan, and of course, packing everyone up and moving into our brand new offices, although you may hear in the background that we've brought some of the sirens with us. With all that, we maintained our focus on execution and produced our strongest quarterly results ever and added another quarter to our streak of consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit increases. My sincere thanks to all the associates at Foot Locker who made it possible.
It is only because of the diligent work of the last several years to build and strengthen the diversity of our business in terms of product categories, geographies, families of business and channels, that we were able to post a solid comparable sales gain for the quarter in the face of a mid-single-digit decline in basketball. Although we had planned basketball to be off, the category ended up a bit softer than we had expected, which is the primary reason our quarterly comp gain came in somewhat below our guidance.
The basketball business, like all our other categories, thrives on newness and innovation, and where that was apparent, our basketball business remains strong. The Jordan Brand continues to innovate and produce excellent results, with the Sportswear side of that brand giving the biggest dollar gains.
In fact, John here, has finally put away his low-profile Kobe's for a really cool pair of Jordan Horizons he brought back from our House of Hoops store in London. The casual portion of basketball, outside of Jordan, was also strong, led by models such as Superstars by adi as well as Foamposites and Air Force 1s from Nike. It was the signature side of the basketball business that saw the biggest decline. Although even here we saw important elements of excitement. For example, the Stephen Curry shoes from Under Armour and the Kyrie Irving shoes from Nike both posted big gains. Meanwhile, Kobe's sales hung in pretty well in the quarter, likely influenced by the buzz around his retirement.
The primary losses came in LeBron and KD product, a challenge which we've been addressing with our partners at Nike. Between Nike resetting the price value relationship of many of its shoes and focusing their incredible innovation engine, along with the strength of the Under Armour and potential momentum in adidas, we are confident that by the back half of the year, there will be in place all the elements of a more robust, diverse signature basketball business.
In the meantime, our leadership positions in footwear categories other than signature basketball enabled us to successfully pivot much of our inventory position into these areas in Q1. Lifestyle running footwear was an especially good business in the quarter, with the Roshe and Huarache styles from Nike and ZX Flux from adi continuing to be popular sellers.
Category heat and newness was driven by the Nomad and Boost products from adidas. The Stan Smith shoe from adidas is another perfect example of a leadership position we have in an area other than basketball, in this case, classic court shoes. This leading position can be seen in the depth of our buys and in the variety of different model executions we sell, quite a few of which are exclusive. We enjoy a significant number of special makeup styles, not just in Stan Smith's, but also in Superstars, PUMA suedes and various other casual, yet premium products. In retrospect, demands for this special product outstripped supply, giving us confidence in the emphasis of our merchandise position over the next several months.
The very strong adi Originals business is also an excellent example of the advantage of our global footprint, since the trend started in Europe, where our merchants recognized the excitement early and shared their initial success with our U.S. teams before it exploded into a worldwide phenomenon.
Even with the partial shift out of signature basketball, our customers still expect to find and are finding premium sneakers in our stores and on our digital sites. Sneakers for which they are willing to pay premium prices. This led to higher footwear units and average selling prices in the quarter with both up low single digits.
On the apparel side, ASPs were up even more in the mid-single-digit range, driven primarily by lower markdowns. Although apparel units were down low single digits, for the most part, I describe our men's apparel business as improving, especially in Europe. Overall, profitability is up, both in dollars and rate, which as I said last quarter, is a great place to start. We're still working on driving more apparel volume in each of our banners, and the investment in our store remodel programs continues to be an important element of our strategy to elevate the storytelling around the premium special products our vendors are beginning to deliver.
On the women's side, apparel comps were down as the Lady Foot Locker and especially the SIX:02 customer has almost completely shifted off athletic performance silhouettes into athletic lifestyle. Adi, Nike and PUMA, all have some exciting celebrity- driven assortments, but the quantities weren't enough to offset the decline in the sales of performance products from a year ago.
Meanwhile, the overall women's business is being driven by footwear where the Superstar, Stan Smith and Nike casual running trends are even stronger for her than they are for the men. Another clear indication of the ongoing strength of the sneaker trend is that traffic was positive in the quarter, up low single digits, both in the U.S. and overall. Fortunately, kids still love to touch, feel and try on sneakers and they love to compare and shop together for the latest and greatest athletic footwear and apparel. Two exceptions to the good traffic trends, though, were Runners Point and Sidestep in Germany where traffic was down double digits. Even for the Foot Locker banner in Europe, Germany was the most difficult of the large countries, and German retail, in general, has been a bit tough lately.
That said, we have plenty of opportunity to improve the performance in Runners Point and Sidestep, and it starts with driving more traffic through a combination of more elevated in-store experience, targeted marketing and most importantly, improved and better diversified product assortments.
We've done a lot of work to better define the core customers of these 2 banners, and the results have helped us in the discussions with our vendors to create this sort of special focused assortments that really motivate these customers.
At this point, there hasn't been enough product depth to stem the comp declines, but our inventory position remains sufficiently clean to enable us, we believe, to get these banners back on track as the year progresses. 
Turning to our digital business, the growth in our store banner.com continues to be strong, although not at the same pace as a year ago. We continue to invest in the technological infrastructure behind our digital sites and enrich the content on the customer-facing side. Perhaps most importantly, we're rethinking our approach to our channels. As Pawan Verma, our Chief Information Officer, recently described, the concept of a channel doesn't really exist for our customers, only the relationships they have with our brand. Thus our capital spending is now more consistently based on strengthening that relationship across all of our sales channels.
A good example of the return on that investment can be seen in our expanding boss sales, buy online, ship-from-store. Already available across our domestic banners, we rolled it out in the U.K. in the first quarter and plan to expand it onto the European continent in future quarters. The softest part of our digital business right now is Eastbay, which as Lauren described, is really focused on the serious high school athlete. The shift to casual and lifestyle silhouettes and a slightly declining rate of youth participation in certain sports, such as football, have hindered Eastbay's top line recently. While Eastbay's merchants are shifting a portion of their assortments more in the direction of lifestyle, we attempt to keep true to the performance heritage and identity of the Eastbay banner. We're working to enhance our current customers' digital experience and increase brand awareness at younger ages.
The goal is to expand the pipeline of kids who know and love the Eastbay brand as they pursue their passion for sports. Examples of success already include the growth in our training and girls volleyball businesses.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the record-setting performance of our team this quarter. We challenge ourselves every day to be a high-performing organization. Sometimes circumstances don't allow us to clear the bar by as much as we'd like to, but with the long-term trends towards casualization and active lifestyles firmly intact, the athletic footwear and apparel industry is an exciting space to be in.
We've got a great team of associates and a great lineup of vendor partners. And together, we have many tremendous opportunities to grow and improve Foot Locker's business, as we work to achieve the long-term goals we outlined last year.
Carlos, let's please open up the call for questions now."

I know -- Lauren, thanks for the detail on the current quarter trends and the launches coming up. But is it -- could you help us think a little bit about the composition of the launches to the quarter and the inventory you have in hand. It sounds like some of the signature basketball areas have been struggling. Is that inventory changing over as near term as it would seem like it wouldn't -- it would need to be able to get to that mid-single digit confidently in the second quarter?"

Normally, we wouldn't talk about that so much except 3 weeks into the quarter it certainly has a -- makes a difference on the trend. Our team's done a really good job of shifting the inventory into some of the casual businesses that we talked about in our prepared remarks, and the launch cadence for the rest of the quarter lines up really favorably for us. So certainly, the mid-single digits that Lauren talked about and I talked about in our comments are attainable in the quarter, Michael."

She is a very discerning shopper. She expects the performance characteristics to be built in, but she's also looking for it to be very fashionable. We've seen success with some of the Rihanna product that's launched, that asset-driven model with great looking product that she can use in the gym or in her active lifestyle is really helping drive that business. And we're shifting, we're up against big performance silhouettes from last year, bigger numbers. So as she changes and our inventory changes with her, that will certainly be a contributor. Apparel, in general, as I said, is getting better. The Europe team is leading that effort. Their apparel business was up nicely. Apparel is getting better at Champs and the Kids Foot Locker in solidifying its position at Foot Locker. So we've got certainly some upside on the apparel front. The categories that we mentioned, some of the classic sneakers, some of the lifestyle running shoes, again, our inventories shifting appropriately. So we see great opportunity there. Our inventory's clean and fresh. So we'll be able to manage our markdowns through the quarters, and so that really is what's going to improve sales and the margin opportunity, Michael. As far as Runners Point, we've got a traffic issue there. Retail in Germany has been a little bit tough for all of our banners, including, actually, all of the segment. But, I think, as I talked about, we've done the deep dive on our customers and the Runners Point and Sidestep doors, we continue to shift the inventory there, get the inventory properly positioned. And it goes back to firing customers when we took out the vulcanized product in the boots and relaunching, if you will, a running only shop on the High Street with Runners Point, making sure we get all of the inventory right. So the effort in the short term is to drive traffic. Once they get in the store, we're able to convert them because we've got a great sales force and a great team on the store floor there. But again, we've got to get some traffic in the doors."

The new KD shoe is out in a couple of weeks. So we'll get a first pass at that. The Curry shoe, the Kyrie shoe, they continue to be strong, and we've got the Olympics, which drives innovation across a lot of things that we'll see in the back half come to a commercial -- to be commercialized in the back half. So again, I think the consumer, as we've shown in specific shoes, the consumer in Canada certainly didn't have any issues around signature basketballs that led into the All-Star game. So when there's excitement around the product, when there's innovation around the product and when the price value relationship is right for the kid, the category is fine. And we expect that in the back half with some of the things we've seen coming down the product pipeline. So again, the kid is very discerning and signature basketball is one of his choices. But the strength that we've added to our portfolio across the casual sneakers, the Boost product from adidas, there's tremendous opportunity in all of our categories. And that's why the work we've done over the last few years to really build this portfolio of businesses, allows us to absorb a little bit of a body blow on the signature basketball side and still drive a successful winning business."

So that sort of what 2016 is about, and we expect to continue or accelerate the rollout as we get into 2017 with SIX:02. Runners Point and Sidestep, we detailed a little bit about where the challenges are. The rollout there will probably take a little bit slower track until we're confident that we've got the assortment right and that running stores specifically around Runners Point are the right formula on the High Street in Western Europe. So we opened in Vienna last year. So as we take Runners Point slowly out of Germany, we'll measure the results there. Sidestep, we've got some work going on in terms of store format, and we just have to get those things right. We take a pretty pragmatic approach to build a prototype, see the results of the prototype, test it, tweak it, evaluate it again before we go into a full-blown rollout.

So we think that the basketball trend line improves, but we also think that the customer is very flexible in their foot covering choices, their sneaker choices these days. So wherever there's a cool sneaker, they're going to find it at Foot Locker, and they're going to choose the category. They don't -- it's a little bit like them not thinking about channels. They don't really think about categories that much. They think about coolness, and if the sneakers got the cool factor for whatever they want to do, that's the sneaker that they'll buy. So again, we see strength, we have a certain level of exclusives across all categories. But one of the real advantages we've got and we've called it out in our prepared remarks, is that we see things happening all around the globe. So our European business may beyond something quicker than our U.S. business or quicker than our vendor partners bring it to the U.S. marketplace. It's one of the things that happened with this great turn that we've seen with adidas. Our European team called it out. Our U.S. team was able to get on some of the sneakers sooner than we probably would have had we not had that European business. So again, the strength of the portfolio goes across categories, it goes across geographies, it goes across contact points with the consumer. And I guess your last question on it, is there enough of the hot product in the marketplace? There's never enough of the hot product in the marketplace, and that's what the scarcity model is all about. So we see -- I mean, you all saw the adidas results, you see the Under Armour results, you know that they're having success. Would we want some more of their key products? Absolutely. But again, the scarcity model is what fuels our sneaker industry. So again, my hats off to all of our suppliers as they manage the marketplaces that we do business in."

Thank you for joining us today for the first earnings call from our brand new offices at 330 West 34th Street. It's been an exciting transition in the last few weeks.
We reported in this morning's press release that the company achieved record net income of $191 million in the quarter, up from $184 million in the first quarter last year. On a per share basis, Foot Locker earned $1.39 this year, an 8% increase compared to the $1.29 earned in the same period in 2015. It was the highest quarterly net income and EPS results in the company's history, a significant achievement, especially in today's challenging retail environment.
We achieved a comparable sales gain of 2.9% in the quarter. Although this result was a shade below the range of our expectation going into the quarter for a mid-single-digit increase, these sales and profits do represent the 25th consecutive quarter of meaningful growth for Foot Locker.
In order to leave as much time as possible for your questions, let me hand the call straight away to Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to review the results of the quarter in more detail.

That said, we have set the bar even higher than we achieved. 
So let's begin to what worked well and where we fell a bit short. First, the cadence of our comparable sales was fairly steady during the quarter, with the gain landing as expected in the mid-single-digit range in February. But it was up low single digits in March and April, short of our mid-single-digit planned gain. The strong diversity of our assortments and the leadership positions we have in many product categories enabled us to post that 2.9% comp gain despite basketball footwear being down mid-single digits. In fact, total company footwear comps were up mid-single digits in the quarter, with strength in lifestyle running and classic style more than offsetting the decline in basketball shoe sales.
Apparel posted a low single-digit gain, while accessories were down high single digits, primarily the result of the challenging trend in socks. Proving that with the right product, basketball still performs very well, our strongest division this quarter was Foot Locker Canada with the comparable sales gain in the high-teens. This result was fueled by a strong double-digit gain in basketball footwear. Although the gain was initially propelled by the All-Star game in Toronto this year, Canada's strong double-digit performance was sustained throughout the quarter, and there were meaningful sales gains across the country, not just in Toronto.
Our next strongest store division was Foot Locker Europe, which turned in a high single-digit comparable sales gain on top of last year's double-digit gain. 
On the other side of the ledger, Runners Point and Sidestep continue to face assortment challenges, with sales in both banners down double digits from a year ago.
To round out our international division, Foot Locker Asia Pacific continued its high level of performance, turning in a strong mid-single-digit sales gain on top of last year's gain in the teens. 
Turning to our U.S. store divisions. Champs Sports led the way with a mid-single digit comparable sales increase. Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and our women's division, Lady Foot Locker SIX:02 were each up low single digit. Footaction posted a comp loss in the high single digits. 
There were 2 primary elements of Footaction's underperformance in the quarter. First, it has a relatively high penetration of basketball compared to other banners. And second, it doesn't offer women's footwear, which has been quite a strong contributor to our other banners recently. In fact, for the quarter, women's comparable footwear sales were up mid-single digits, while our sales of kid's footwear across the banners that sell children's products was even stronger, up high single digits. Sales of men's footwear were down slightly.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid performance, with an overall comparable sales gain of 7.3%. Sales of our store banner.com businesses, including both domestic and international banners, increased more than 20% on top of last year's almost 40% increase.
Eastbay, on the other hand, declined mid-single digit. The story of Eastbay which caters to the elite high school athlete remains similar to last quarter, with core performance shoes and apparel trending down relative to the casual assortments in which our store banner site have a stronger position. 
Our gross margin rate was flat in the quarter with 30 basis points of merchandise margin improvement offset by slight occupancy deleverage and higher shipping and handling expense. As we noted on our previous call, we need to comp at least in the low end of mid singles to leverage occupancy, and we fell just short of that this quarter. The uptick in merchandise margin was fairly consistent across footwear, apparel and accessories, driven by lower markdowns.
As expected, our SG&A rate delevered slightly to 18.2% of sales in the first quarter, largely due to incurring almost $4 million of expenses related to the move into our exciting new office space.
Without the move costs, our SG&A rate would have held flat at 18%, thanks to the excellent work of our expense management team. Depreciation expense increased to $39 million from $35 million in Q1, reflecting the company's ongoing investments in enhancing and aligning the customer experience across all of our channels: stores, digital, mobile and social media. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 36%, slightly below our expected run rate of 36.5%. Relative to plan, our mix of income in the quarter came proportionately more from Europe, where our tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The record net income we reported for the quarter also led to strong cash flow, and we finished the quarter with $1,062 million in cash. The first quarter typically represents our peak cash position, with balances subsequently declining until we reach the year-end holiday selling period.
Over time, the proportion of our cash held overseas has grown relative to cash in the U.S. And just this week, we closed on a new $400 million credit facility, up from $200 million before. The new expanded facility allows us to maintain our liquidity in the U.S., while continuing to invest in our U.S. store fleet and our digital and mobile platform, as well as actively repurchasing shares, funding our dividend program and being prepared for other opportunities or challenges.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.37 million shares for $87.8 million. We spent approximately $65 million of capital as we continue to track towards our planned expenditures this year of $297 million.
An important part of our capital spending this year is to elevate 2 of our flagship stores here in Midtown Manhattan, both the 34th Street store below our former office and the Foot Locker store in Times Square closed during the first quarter. 
Our exciting new Times Square store will not open until the holiday. The 34th Street store is slated to reopen for back-to-school, but it will be closed during all of Q2, and the lost sales from that high-volume store are enough to reduce our overall comp a few ticks in the current quarter.
Inventory increased 2.1% at the end of Q1, slightly above our target, given the 3.9% sales increase on a constant currency basis. Our inventory remains fresh and productive with turns continuing to tick up towards our long-range goal. Most importantly, we believe our inventory position supports the mid-single-digit sales gain with primarily full price selling that we continue to plan for over the balance of the year. We continue to believe we can achieve a mid-single digit comp for the full year as well as double-digit EPS growth with 10 to 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. We believe that this performance is also achievable in each of the remaining quarters, including this one.
As we expected, comp sales are running down month-to-date, but we're once again on the negative side of a very significant launch shift. One of the more powerful Jordan releases of this entire year is coming next weekend. Whereas, last year, a similarly strong Jordan release had already happened by this time in the month. Over such a short period of 3 weeks, the impact of this launch definitely has the potential to lift our May comp well into positive territory.
That said, Q2 is already the lowest volume quarter of the year, and this year, we have 2 of our very top stores closed. So SG&A leverage will again be a challenge in the quarter. As always, we will manage the business tightly, not just SG&A but also inventory and occupancy to maximize our profits this quarter and position ourselves for a strong second half of the year.
Let me hand the call to Dick now to cover the product highlights in more depth and discuss how we see the industry and our business shaping up over the balance of the year."

As you could tell from Lauren's remarks, there was a lot going on this",1602,"Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks today by thanking everyone on the Foot Locker, Inc. team for producing our best, most profitable quarter ever. As you could tell from Lauren's remarks, there was a lot going on this quarter with some fast-moving product category shifts, big events like the All-Star game in Toronto, the temporary closure of 2 of our biggest volume stores here in Midtown Manhattan, and of course, packing everyone up and moving into our brand new offices, although you may hear in the background that we've brought some of the sirens with us. With all that, we maintained our focus on execution and produced our strongest quarterly results ever and added another quarter to our streak of consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit increases. My sincere thanks to all the associates at Foot Locker who made it possible.
It is only because of the diligent work of the last several years to build and strengthen the diversity of our business in terms of product categories, geographies, families of business and channels, that we were able to post a solid comparable sales gain for the quarter in the face of a mid-single-digit decline in basketball. Although we had planned basketball to be off, the category ended up a bit softer than we had expected, which is the primary reason our quarterly comp gain came in somewhat below our guidance.
The basketball business, like all our other categories, thrives on newness and innovation, and where that was apparent, our basketball business remains strong. The Jordan Brand continues to innovate and produce excellent results, with the Sportswear side of that brand giving the biggest dollar gains.
In fact, John here, has finally put away his low-profile Kobe's for a really cool pair of Jordan Horizons he brought back from our House of Hoops store in London. The casual portion of basketball, outside of Jordan, was also strong, led by models such as Superstars by adi as well as Foamposites and Air Force 1s from Nike. It was the signature side of the basketball business that saw the biggest decline. Although even here we saw important elements of excitement. For example, the Stephen Curry shoes from Under Armour and the Kyrie Irving shoes from Nike both posted big gains. Meanwhile, Kobe's sales hung in pretty well in the quarter, likely influenced by the buzz around his retirement.
The primary losses came in LeBron and KD product, a challenge which we've been addressing with our partners at Nike. Between Nike resetting the price value relationship of many of its shoes and focusing their incredible innovation engine, along with the strength of the Under Armour and potential momentum in adidas, we are confident that by the back half of the year, there will be in place all the elements of a more robust, diverse signature basketball business.
In the meantime, our leadership positions in footwear categories other than signature basketball enabled us to successfully pivot much of our inventory position into these areas in Q1. Lifestyle running footwear was an especially good business in the quarter, with the Roshe and Huarache styles from Nike and ZX Flux from adi continuing to be popular sellers.
Category heat and newness was driven by the Nomad and Boost products from adidas. The Stan Smith shoe from adidas is another perfect example of a leadership position we have in an area other than basketball, in this case, classic court shoes. This leading position can be seen in the depth of our buys and in the variety of different model executions we sell, quite a few of which are exclusive. We enjoy a significant number of special makeup styles, not just in Stan Smith's, but also in Superstars, PUMA suedes and various other casual, yet premium products. In retrospect, demands for this special product outstripped supply, giving us confidence in the emphasis of our merchandise position over the next several months.
The very strong adi Originals business is also an excellent example of the advantage of our global footprint, since the trend started in Europe, where our merchants recognized the excitement early and shared their initial success with our U.S. teams before it exploded into a worldwide phenomenon.
Even with the partial shift out of signature basketball, our customers still expect to find and are finding premium sneakers in our stores and on our digital sites. Sneakers for which they are willing to pay premium prices. This led to higher footwear units and average selling prices in the quarter with both up low single digits.
On the apparel side, ASPs were up even more in the mid-single-digit range, driven primarily by lower markdowns. Although apparel units were down low single digits, for the most part, I describe our men's apparel business as improving, especially in Europe. Overall, profitability is up, both in dollars and rate, which as I said last quarter, is a great place to start. We're still working on driving more apparel volume in each of our banners, and the investment in our store remodel programs continues to be an important element of our strategy to elevate the storytelling around the premium special products our vendors are beginning to deliver.
On the women's side, apparel comps were down as the Lady Foot Locker and especially the SIX:02 customer has almost completely shifted off athletic performance silhouettes into athletic lifestyle. Adi, Nike and PUMA, all have some exciting celebrity- driven assortments, but the quantities weren't enough to offset the decline in the sales of performance products from a year ago.
Meanwhile, the overall women's business is being driven by footwear where the Superstar, Stan Smith and Nike casual running trends are even stronger for her than they are for the men. Another clear indication of the ongoing strength of the sneaker trend is that traffic was positive in the quarter, up low single digits, both in the U.S. and overall. Fortunately, kids still love to touch, feel and try on sneakers and they love to compare and shop together for the latest and greatest athletic footwear and apparel. Two exceptions to the good traffic trends, though, were Runners Point and Sidestep in Germany where traffic was down double digits. Even for the Foot Locker banner in Europe, Germany was the most difficult of the large countries, and German retail, in general, has been a bit tough lately.
That said, we have plenty of opportunity to improve the performance in Runners Point and Sidestep, and it starts with driving more traffic through a combination of more elevated in-store experience, targeted marketing and most importantly, improved and better diversified product assortments.
We've done a lot of work to better define the core customers of these 2 banners, and the results have helped us in the discussions with our vendors to create this sort of special focused assortments that really motivate these customers.
At this point, there hasn't been enough product depth to stem the comp declines, but our inventory position remains sufficiently clean to enable us, we believe, to get these banners back on track as the year progresses. 
Turning to our digital business, the growth in our store banner.com continues to be strong, although not at the same pace as a year ago. We continue to invest in the technological infrastructure behind our digital sites and enrich the content on the customer-facing side. Perhaps most importantly, we're rethinking our approach to our channels. As Pawan Verma, our Chief Information Officer, recently described, the concept of a channel doesn't really exist for our customers, only the relationships they have with our brand. Thus our capital spending is now more consistently based on strengthening that relationship across all of our sales channels.
A good example of the return on that investment can be seen in our expanding boss sales, buy online, ship-from-store. Already available across our domestic banners, we rolled it out in the U.K. in the first quarter and plan to expand it onto the European continent in future quarters. The softest part of our digital business right now is Eastbay, which as Lauren described, is really focused on the serious high school athlete. The shift to casual and lifestyle silhouettes and a slightly declining rate of youth participation in certain sports, such as football, have hindered Eastbay's top line recently. While Eastbay's merchants are shifting a portion of their assortments more in the direction of lifestyle, we attempt to keep true to the performance heritage and identity of the Eastbay banner. We're working to enhance our current customers' digital experience and increase brand awareness at younger ages.
The goal is to expand the pipeline of kids who know and love the Eastbay brand as they pursue their passion for sports. Examples of success already include the growth in our training and girls volleyball businesses.
Before I turn the call over for your questions, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the record-setting performance of our team this quarter. We challenge ourselves every day to be a high-performing organization. Sometimes circumstances don't allow us to clear the bar by as much as we'd like to, but with the long-term trends towards casualization and active lifestyles firmly intact, the athletic footwear and apparel industry is an exciting space to be in.
We've got a great team of associates and a great lineup of vendor partners. And together, we have many tremendous opportunities to grow and improve Foot Locker's business, as we work to achieve the long-term goals we outlined last year.

Our team's done a really good job of shifting the inventory into some of the casual businesses that we talked about in our prepared remarks, and the launch cadence for the rest of the quarter lines up really favorably for us. So certainly, the mid-single digits that Lauren talked about and I talked about in our comments are attainable in the quarter, Michael."

She is a very discerning shopper. She expects the performance characteristics to be built in, but she's also looking for it to be very fashionable. We've seen success with some of the Rihanna product that's launched, that asset-driven model with great looking product that she can use in the gym or in her active lifestyle is really helping drive that business. And we're shifting, we're up against big performance silhouettes from last year, bigger numbers. So as she changes and our inventory changes with her, that will certainly be a contributor. Apparel, in general, as I said, is getting better. The Europe team is leading that effort. Their apparel business was up nicely. Apparel is getting better at Champs and the Kids Foot Locker in solidifying its position at Foot Locker. So we've got certainly some upside on the apparel front. The categories that we mentioned, some of the classic sneakers, some of the lifestyle running shoes, again, our inventories shifting appropriately. So we see great opportunity there. Our inventory's clean and fresh. So we'll be able to manage our markdowns through the quarters, and so that really is what's going to improve sales and the margin opportunity, Michael. As far as Runners Point, we've got a traffic issue there. Retail in Germany has been a little bit tough for all of our banners, including, actually, all of the segment. But, I think, as I talked about, we've done the deep dive on our customers and the Runners Point and Sidestep doors, we continue to shift the inventory there, get the inventory properly positioned. And it goes back to firing customers when we took out the vulcanized product in the boots and relaunching, if you will, a running only shop on the High Street with Runners Point, making sure we get all of the inventory right. So the effort in the short term is to drive traffic. Once they get in the store, we're able to convert them because we've got a great sales force and a great team on the store floor there. But again, we've got to get some traffic in the doors."

The new KD shoe is out in a couple of weeks. So we'll get a first pass at that. The Curry shoe, the Kyrie shoe, they continue to be strong, and we've got the Olympics, which drives innovation across a lot of things that we'll see in the back half come to a commercial -- to be commercialized in the back half. So again, I think the consumer, as we've shown in specific shoes, the consumer in Canada certainly didn't have any issues around signature basketballs that led into the All-Star game. So when there's excitement around the product, when there's innovation around the product and when the price value relationship is right for the kid, the category is fine. And we expect that in the back half with some of the things we've seen coming down the product pipeline. So again, the kid is very discerning and signature basketball is one of his choices. But the strength that we've added to our portfolio across the casual sneakers, the Boost product from adidas, there's tremendous opportunity in all of our categories. And that's why the work we've done over the last few years to really build this portfolio of businesses, allows us to absorb a little bit of a body blow on the signature basketball side and still drive a successful winning business."

So again, to think that there is a permanent shift from one category to another category, you certainly don't look at the business like that. Our team is constantly evaluating where we believe the consumer will be. We're working with our vendor partners to create great product, and there just is nothing in our business that's permanent. So I think you need to understand the flexibility that our consumer has and that they're ultimately in control of the product decision."

So we think that the basketball trend line improves, but we also think that the customer is very flexible in their foot covering choices, their sneaker choices these days. So wherever there's a cool sneaker, they're going to find it at Foot Locker, and they're going to choose the category. They don't -- it's a little bit like them not thinking about channels. They don't really think about categories that much. They think about coolness, and if the sneakers got the cool factor for whatever they want to do, that's the sneaker that they'll buy. So again, we see strength, we have a certain level of exclusives across all categories. But one of the real advantages we've got and we've called it out in our prepared remarks, is that we see things happening all around the globe. So our European business may beyond something quicker than our U.S. business or quicker than our vendor partners bring it to the U.S. marketplace. It's one of the things that happened with this great turn that we've seen with adidas. Our European team called it out. Our U.S. team was able to get on some of the sneakers sooner than we probably would have had we not had that European business. So again, the strength of the portfolio goes across categories, it goes across geographies, it goes across contact points with the consumer. And I guess your last question on it, is there enough of the hot product in the marketplace? There's never enough of the hot product in the marketplace, and that's what the scarcity model is all about. So we see -- I mean, you all saw the adidas results, you see the Under Armour results, you know that they're having success. Would we want some more of their key products? Absolutely. But again, the scarcity model is what fuels our sneaker industry. So again, my hats off to all of our suppliers as they manage the marketplaces that we do business in."

Good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. Well, overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business.

Well, overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business. 
As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas where traction was somewhat elusive. Starting on the positive side of the ledger, Foot Locker Canada again lead our store division, followed closely by Champs Sports, both with low double-digit comparable sales gains. Foot Locker Canada pulled off a hat trick with double-digit gains in footwear, apparel and accessories. Champs Sports posted gains in all 3 areas, too, representing an important inflection point for Champs, where apparel and accessories constitute the largest sales penetration of any of our banners.
Several store divisions produced comp gains in the mid single-digit range, including Foot Locker in the U.S. As we noted on the last call, our flagship Foot Locker store on 34th Street was closed for the entire quarter, negatively impacting the total company comp by a few ticks. Ticks meaning tenths of basis point. The Foot Locker U.S. division itself was impacted by more than 100 basis points. So we are pleased with how well the Foot Locker team in the U.S. navigated that headwind.
Foot Locker Europe, Foot Locker Asia Pacific and Footaction were the other divisions with mid-single digit comps. With the performance of some exciting new stores, such as State Street in Chicago, Footaction in total generated a double-digit sales increase. 
The strategy to expand our leading position in the kids business continues to be a major contributor to our success. The Kids Foot Locker itself produced a low single-digit comp increase. With the net addition of 26 stores, total sales were up almost 10%. 
The sales of children's footwear and our other banners were up double digit. Lady Foot Locker SIX:02, comps down low mid-single, unfortunately, breaking its 2-year streak of comp gain. Although footwear sales continued to be strong, apparel was down double digits. Lifestyle apparel sold well, but we didn't keep pace with the rapid shift out of performance styles by our female customers. 
Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to run off double-digit, pressured by traffic declines, which seem to be at least in part a function of local events in Germany. Traffic was also down in our Foot Locker stores in Germany and Foot Locker sales were softer there than in most other markets. 
Turning to our direct-to-customer segment. The business overall comped up 7.1%. Sales by our store banner.com businesses in the U.S. increased in the teens with significantly higher growth rates of Foot Locker's digital businesses in Europe and Canada. On the negative side of the ledger, Eastbay continues to struggle with sales declining high single-digits. The shift away from performance continue to challenge this very sports focused banner, due to heightened sporting-goods liquidation activity that went on during the quarter.
For the total company, footwear continued to be the standout category with an overall gain in the upper end of mid single-digit. Running was at mid single-digit and so with basketball. While court classic and casual styles led the way with high single-digit gain. The fairly consistent sales result across footwear categories this quarter is yet another excellent example of our ability to navigate the never-ending shift from style purposes of our customers. 
We continue to look to our stores and online sites for the most innovative, trend-right sneakers. They know they can count on us to have what's hot, or should I say what's school. Maintaining the trend of recent quarters, both average selling prices and units were up in footwear during the quarter. While in apparel, ASPs were up and units were down, reflecting our ongoing shift to more premium apparel assortment. 
Our apparel business continues to improve, with men's apparel, by far the largest piece of the category for us, up mid single-digits, and kids apparel up double digits. 
The women's side, as I mentioned before, was challenged, as were accessories. The sock business was the main culprit in accessories, still running down double-digits, although we generated gains in hats, bags and shoe care products. You'll recall that when we gave you our quarter-to-date comp result back in May, we were running negative, but we said we expected the month of May to end positive, which is in fact what happened. We then had a very strong June, up high single-digits, with July up mid single-digits. The overall result was the mid single-digit comparable sales gain, which we guided early in the quarter.
After looking at the relationship over time of our quarter-to-date comp with our finished comps for the quarter and by listening to many of you, we have concluded that our quarter-to-date results as of the time of our call are not useful indicators of the expected pace of business for the total quarter. And so after this call, we will no longer provide the quarter-to-date comp. 
Rest assured the quarter to date comp, whatever it is, will be factored into the comp guidance we do provide you for the upcoming quarter. If there are some special short-term effects that weren't calling out, we will do so. But between launch shift, holidays, payday shifts and the like, we believe providing early quarter-to-date comps does not add value to understanding our business. That said, for this final mention of quarter-to-date comp, they are up mid single-digit, in line with our expectation for comparable sales to be up mid single-digits for the full quarter.
Turning now to the rest of the income statement. John mentioned the strong gross margin rate, which was 33% for the quarter, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gains were driven by lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decline in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. 
In response to the competitive environment and the softening of traffics to our U.S. website, we were more promotional in our digital businesses than we had expected heading into the quarter. 
We also spent more to drive traffic to our website, which contributed to a slight deleverage of our SG&A in the quarter to 19.7%. Overall, we have very good expense management, especially in the store wages. However, as we noted the call in May, with 2 of our because stores closed for the entire duration of what is already our lowest sales volume quarter, our leverage point was challenge. 
Depreciation expense continues to trend up as a result of our ongoing investment in customer experience, both in-store and digital. While our tax rate continue to run slightly below our plan due to the proportionately higher mix of income from our international operations relative to the U.S. 
We continue to manage inventory very closely, posting a 1.7% increase compared to a 5% total sales increase. This inventory discipline is key to our ability to continuously flow in the fresh, exciting products our customers expect and extend our full price selling even further. 
Meanwhile, our inventory turn rate is inching ever closer to the 3x charges we set as our goal several years ago. The income statement and balance sheet performance, as we have executed in recent years, have positioned us to deliver on the balanced approach to capital allocation to which we are committed. Specifically, we invested $66 million of capital on the business during the quarter. We execute our elevated capital expenditure program this year. That said, it is probable that we will come in $5 million to $10 million below the $297 million target we said at the beginning of the year with the shortfall primarily the result of the timing of certain substantial projects related both to stores and infrastructure initiatives. Any shortfall in spending this year will likely roll over to next year.
We also spent $188 million in the quarter to buy back 3.35 million shares, bringing our total year-to-date shareholder return, including dividends, to $350 million compared to $275 million in the first half for 2015. With the mid single-digit comparable sales gain that I mentioned we're planning for the third quarter, we will likely see similar operating metrics about seem so far this year, with gross margin up slightly and a bit of deleverage in SG&A driven by the digital business, leading to an EPS increase, which should be double digits or close to it. 
Our outlook for the full year remains a mid single-digit comparable sales gains and double-digit EPS growth. Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our leadership positions in the industry and highlight a few of the key product trends this quarter."

Our vision for many years has been to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. The goal of any competition, however, and retail is a terrific competition each and every day, is not to be leading at the midway point of the race, it's to be the leader at the end, except in retail, there's never an end to the race. So we strive to our strategic initiatives to build up company to be an enduring retail leader with strength across the variety of dimensions. 
First and foremost, we must be leaders with our customers. We are leaders in understanding what our customers want and how and when they want it. We spent a tremendous amount of time identifying the key characteristics of the core customers of each of our banners and what makes them want to engage in transacting with us. This work, in turn, makes us a leading partner for our world-class vendors as they create and market the most innovative, athletically inspired products. 
The investments we have made in our store fleet, both in the physical appearance of the stores and the quality of the merchandise assortments, have lead to our stores being destinations for our customers. This can be seen in our traffic results, which consistently outpace overall mall or High Street traffic. 
Our traffic was up in the U.S. this quarter, although it was down somewhat in Europe. Being a strong retail destination positions us as a leading partner with our landlords in the malls and increasingly, in the prime shopping streets across our global footprint. 
And our most important investments have been in our people, leading us to have, in my opinion, the best talents in retail, including our associates in our stores, in the field and in all of our support facilities. This powerful combination enabled us to build strong leadership position across the athletic retail industry. Let me first talk about product categories. 
We believe we're the leading retailer of premium sneakers, period, not just a specific category of sneakers, sneakers, full stop. Yes, we're the leader of basketball. Lauren mentioned the basketball footwear was up mid single-digits. The gains came in a variety of silhouettes, primarily from Jordan Retros, Nike Foamposites, Superstars from Adidas and certain signature basketball shoes, such as Kyrie Irving from Nike and Stephen Curry from Under Armour, to call out a few. 
We were up in running footwear where, we also lead the market. The category here was led by lifestyle products, such as the establishes Roche and Huarache programs from Nike with goal driven especially by nomad and ultra boost from Adidas and the Presto from Nike. 
Finally, we lead the market in sales of various casual and premium classic shoes. This quarter, some the standout styles were Stan Smiths from Adidas and consumer suedes and peers. We have strong inventory positions, as well as important exclusives and collaborations in many of these classic styles just as we do in running and basketball. Our vendors know that our banners provide the perfect battlegrounds to fight it out to win market share, especially with the young male customers who buy the most sneakers and why the tyle for the rest of their generations and increasingly, for the rest of us. Since every day, it seems more and more adults are wearing sneakers, too. That's way the leading brands continue to be highly motivated to collaborate with us on these exclusives and strong allocations. 
We're a leading retail of premium athletic footwear and apparel, not just in the U.S, but also across Western Europe, Canada and Australia. Lauren mentioned that the Foot Locker banner was up mid single-digits in Europe and Asia Pacific, but what she didn't mention is that both of those gains came on top of double-digit gains 1 year ago, leading to 2-year stat gains close to 20%. 
Running is the leading product category in both of those divisions, by the way, not basketball. And Canada's double-digit comp gain this year also came on top the double-digit gain last year. Those are definitely all industry-leading performances. They're not just leader in store productivity, but our digital businesses are approaching annual sales of $1 billion, as we continue to connect with our customers often multiple times on their journey to selecting their favorite sneaker or piece of apparel. Those connections are more and more often happening on mobile devices, where we lead in social media interaction, including some of the newer platforms, such as Instagram stories, Facebook Live and Snapchat. Right now, you can check out the recent exclusive Twitter Q&A we hosted with James Harden. And next week, we are partnering in the launch of the Bit Mo app. We have Foot Locker House of Hoops, Foot Locker House of Hoops and SIX:02 store within bit mode fashion, where customers can up date their avatars with the latest products from Nike, Adidas and others. 
Finally, I want to mention that we've been hard at work creating what I believe will be the leading destination for the best in athletic footwear and apparel and accessories right here in Midtown Manhattan. Our flagship store at 34th Street is slated to reopen in a matter of days, and we couldn't be more excited about it. The space will include not just pinnacle footwear experiences, but also new and exciting presence for SIX:02 here in the city, as well as partnerships spaces with multiple vendors. The details are still a bit under wraps, but rest assured, there will be plenty of fanfare about it soon. So please look for that over the next couple of weeks. And if you're in the area, you should visit the store once it opens. 
All of these efforts I've just described led to a strong financial performance we have produced over the last 6.5 years, which has in turn, enabled us to provide industry-leading shareholder returns, including the elevated share repurchases Lauren described earlier, yet we feel our work has just begun. 
As I said before, the competition in retail is never over and we still have a long way to go to reach most of the 2020 objectives we laid out at the beginning of last year. 
Within our solid growth plan, we have initiatives that are delivering excellent results now, such as expanding the kids business globally, building our Foot Locker banner in Europe and growing our digital business. Plus, our core business of selling athletic footwear to young males in U.S. is making steady progress towards the productivity objectives embedded in our long-term goals based in large measure on the remodel program we continue to execute. 
Meanwhile, we're making real headway in the apparel business, as seen especially by the strong results in Europe and the turnaround in Champs Sports. It will still take some time for our improvements in the apparel to substantially move the needle, so I see this as a very important intermediate term opportunity for the company, along with the turnaround in the Runners Point and Sidestep banners we're working on diligently. 
Finally, the women's business remains a tremendous long-term opportunity. As I said, we're excited to bring SIX:02 to New York City in a few days with another key shop opening in our Time Square location towards the end of the year. And if you're not in New York or near any of our other SIX:02 stores, you can see the exciting progress we're making at six:02.com. 
We will keep partnering with our vendors to create and deliver the exciting lifestyle products connected with the meaningful assets to which our female customers have responded enthusiastically. Although we've known all along it will take quite some time to build the business profitably to scale, we do have some exciting product and marketing initiatives coming in the near term. These included continued and enhanced relationships with consumer featuring products that we believe will help give the SIX:02 brand an immediate momentum boost. 
Before we get to your questions, I must thank the excellent team of associates we have at Foot Locker for producing yet another record quarter. The second quarter used to be our toughest quarter. In fact, it still is. But now, instead of barely breaking even in the second quarter, as we did early on in our journey, this year, we earned $127 million or $0.94 per share. It took a lot of excellent teamwork over several years to get us to this level of performance. 
So as we look to the future and how we can improve the business even further, I have to acknowledge all the tremendously good work done by everyone that went in to producing the high-quality, industry-leading results that we announced today. Thank you all very much. Beatrice, let's open the call for questions."

We believe there's only a couple of places in the mall that people will wind up for products. One of them are Foot Locker family store and one of them is the Apple Store. So we know that our customers, our core consumers, want to be in our stores. So the anchors, certainly, there's some lease ramifications when anchors close. But our focus is more on the connectivity with our consumer, the engagement we have with our consumer, building exciting places to shop and buy. They interact with us digitally on their way to the mall. They -- in the mall, we'll take a photo of the sneaker on their foot, and they'll tweet it out or they'll send it out to their group of friends and get the responses back. So the anchor is closing as a change in the -- certainly, in the makeup of the malls. But our consumer's still driven to the malls as a place for social interaction with their friends. So we're confident that regardless of anchor positioning, we should continue to drive traffic into the malls.

And getting the allocations relates to the great relationship of that we have with all of our vendor partners. And right now, in several markets, no matter what retailer you talk to, they would tell you that they don't have enough of the best products. But there's one of the things that our vendor partners really do, is they control the scarcity model, they pump in the prepared number of she's.  Our merchants would always like more. They like 2 feet at the truck when Chafin something is hot. But the vendor partners do a good job of controlling the flow into the marketplace and keeping that ever present demand out there. And I think it helps to keep the heat in our industry. It helps to keep the consumer excited about getting the next. So by and large, it's a good thing. And we continue to work with all of our vendor partners to increase our locations and the storytelling that we do in the store to connect better with the consumer and connect them with the product stores."

From a store count perspective, Susan, we've announced or we've talked about the last few quarters that we slowed down our store development here in 2016 because we've got 2 very significant properties that we're going to open in New York City to give our SIX:02 banner a real presence in the city. And that's the 34th Street store that we'll see open in the next couple of weeks and then Times Square, which will have a SIX:02 shop within it that will open, hopefully, by the end of the year. So that was a decision that we made to slow down the store rollout to make sure that we get those 2 doors right. The SIX:02 team has done a great job of bringing in some new brands, catching up with the lifestyle side of the equation. Again, this female consumer that we're after is very discerning and that she expects all of the performance elements to be present and every piece that she buys, everything that she buys. But it's got to be very stylish. And we've got some great new brands and the best place to sort of see and measure the progress if you're not near a SIX:02 stores on six02.com. And you can see the some the creature goods products that you've got there. So with the intent would be to make sure that we've got the assortment right some the exciting things that we're going to see in 34th Street in Times Square. We've got the physical space right. And then we'll likely accelerate door count when we get into 2017. And we've said all along that this is a really competitive marketplace. So yes, I mean, the fashion is changing, the look is changing, the response and reaction to some of the asset driven models are changing. So it's -- she's a very discerning, very quick moving customer, and we're trying to capture her interest and get her engaged with the SIX:02 brand. It's been a little bit difficult with only 30 doors. So I'm a firm believer that the excitement that's going to be generated out the doors here in the city will certainly give a big momentum push, as will some of the good work that we're going to do with some of our key vendor partners in the SIX:02 space to drive real energy around that banner."

And certainly, Q2, I would track a part the toughness to the market in Germany because none of our burners performed well in the economy with some of the traffic issues that we saw. But from a broader perspective, we're repositioning both Runners Point and Sidestep. And we did some -- how we operate, we test things pretty significantly before we go ahead and while them out. The test that we saw back in 2014, when we positioned Runners Point is all things runner running and Side Step more in the lifestyle into the spectrum with our Foot Locker banner right in between, the results in 2014 were pretty positive. And they convinced us that we can go ahead with that. In hindsight, what we found is there were a couple of really significant silhouettes that were driving the running side of the business, especially in Germany, right? Each market in Western Europe is different. And Germany was definitely like them to a couple of key silhouettes that have fallen out of favor a bit. So it really cost -- first, we fired a bunch of customers from Runners Point because we took out the vulcanized shoes, we took out the skate shoes, we took out the boots and we really focused of that on the running consumer. And then that running consumer moved off a couple of the key silhouettes that have really been propping up the results. So it's an assortment mix. It's a brand mix. And I think the team is addressing it as quickly as they can with the vendor partners. And then the other piece is on the Sidestep side of the house, making sure that we've got the right lifestyle piece of it and a little bit more fashion forward. So we -- we've got work to do there but the team is digital just be working on. We spent a lot of time over in Germany this summer. And we see some progress, but we do definitely have work to do."

Good morning to everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm pleased to report that the company achieved net income of $127 million in the quarter on the strength of a 4.7% comparable sales gain and an improved gross margin rate. 
Earnings per share came in at $0.94, up 12% from a year ago, and 47% up above our EPS 2 years ago, as we continue to drive consistent improvements in operating and financial performance over the long term. 
In fact, this quarter was the 26th consecutive quarter with meaningful sales and profit gains over the prior year period. The strong second quarter result brought our year-to-date earnings to $318 million or $2.33 per share, a 9% increase over a year ago and the best start to a year in Foot Locker's history. Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will start us off by discussing the company's second quarter financial performance; followed by Dick Johnson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss the various strengths Foot Locker has in the athletic industry and highlight some key product trends. After that, we'll be happy to get to your questions. Lauren?"

Good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. Well, overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business. As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas,",1438,"Thank you, John. Good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. Well, overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business. 
As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas, where traction was somewhat elusive. Starting on the positive side of the ledger, Foot Locker Canada again led our store division, followed closely by Champs Sports, both with low double-digit comparable sales gains. Foot Locker Canada pulled off a hat trick, with double-digit gains in footwear, apparel and accessories. Champs Sports posted gains in all 3 areas, too, representing an important inflection point for Champs, where apparel and accessories constitute the largest sales penetration of any of our banners.
Several store divisions produced comp gains in the mid single-digit range, including Foot Locker in the U.S. As we noted on the last call, our flagship Foot Locker store on 34th Street was closed for the entire quarter, negatively impacting the total company comp by a few ticks. Ticks meaning tenths of basis points. The Foot Locker U.S. division itself was impacted by more than 100 basis points. So we are pleased with how well the Foot Locker team in the U.S. navigated that headwind.
Foot Locker Europe, Foot Locker Asia Pacific and Footaction were the other divisions with mid-single-digit comps. With the performance of some exciting new stores, such as State Street in Chicago, Footaction in total generated a double-digit sales increase. 
The strategy to expand our leading position in the kids business continues to be a major contributor to our success. The Kids Foot Locker itself produced a low single-digit comp increase. With the net addition of 26 stores, total sales were up almost 10%. 
The sales of children's footwear and our other banners were up double digit. Lady Foot Locker SIX:02, comps down low mid-single, unfortunately, breaking its 2-year streak of comp gain. Although footwear sales continued to be strong, apparel was down double digits. Lifestyle apparel sold well, but we didn't keep pace with the rapid shift out of performance styles by our female customers. 
Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to run off double digits, pressured by traffic declines, which seem to be at least in part a function of local events in Germany. Traffic was also down in our Foot Locker stores in Germany and Foot Locker sales were softer there than in most other markets. 
Turning to our direct-to-customer segment. The business overall comped up 7.1%. Sales by our store banner.com businesses in the U.S. increased in the teens, with significantly higher growth rates of Foot Locker's digital businesses in Europe and Canada. On the negative side of the ledger, Eastbay continues to struggle, with sales declining high single digits. The shift away from performance continued to challenge this very sports-focused banner because of heightened sporting goods liquidation activity that went on during the quarter.
For the total company, footwear continued to be the standout category, with an overall gain in the upper end of mid-single digits. Running was up mid-single digits and so was basketball, while court classic and casual styles led the way with high single-digit gain. The fairly consistent sales result across footwear categories this quarter is yet another excellent example of our ability to navigate the never-ending shift from style purposes of our customers. 
We continue to look to our stores and online sites for the most innovative, trend-right sneakers. They know they can count on us to have what's hot, or should I say what's cool. Maintaining the trend of recent quarters, both average selling prices and units were up in footwear during the quarter. While in apparel, ASPs were up and units were down, reflecting our ongoing shift to more premium apparel assortment. 
Our apparel business continues to improve, with men's apparel, by far the largest piece of the category for us, up mid-single digits, and kids apparel up double digits. 
The women's side, as I mentioned before, was challenged, as were accessories. The sock business was the main culprit in accessories, still running down double digits, although we generated gains in hats, bags and shoe care products. You'll recall that when we gave you our quarter-to-date comp result back in May, we were running negative, but we said we expected the month of May to end positive, which is in fact what happened. We then had a very strong June, up high single digits, with July up mid-single digits. The overall result was the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, which we guided early in the quarter.
After looking at the relationship over time of our quarter-to-date comp with our finished comps for the quarter and by listening to many of you, we have concluded that our quarter-to-date results as of the time of our call are not useful indicators of the expected pace of business for the total quarter. And so after this call, we will no longer provide the quarter-to-date comp. 
Rest assured the quarter-to-date comp, whatever it is, will be factored into the comp guidance we do provide you for the upcoming quarter. If there are some special short-term effects that weren't calling out, we will do so. But between launch shift, holidays, payday shifts and the like, we believe providing early quarter-to-date comps does not add value to understanding our business. That said, for this final mention of quarter-to-date comp, they are up mid-single digits, in line with our expectation for comparable sales to be up mid-single digits for the full quarter.
Turning now to the rest of the income statement. John mentioned the strong gross margin rate, which was 33% for the quarter, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gains were driven by lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decline in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. 
In response to the competitive environment and the softening of traffic to our U.S. website, we were more promotional in our digital businesses than we had expected heading into the quarter. 
We also spent more to drive traffic to our website, which contributed to a slight deleverage of our SG&A in the quarter to 19.7%. Overall, we have very good expense management, especially in store wages. However, as we noted on the call in May, as 2 of our biggest stores closed for the entire duration of what is already our lowest sales volume quarter, our leverage point was challenged. 
Depreciation expense continued to trend up as a result of our ongoing investment in customer experience, both in-store and digital, while our tax rate continued to run slightly below our plan due to the proportionately higher mix of income from our international operations relative to the U.S. 
We continued to manage inventory very closely, posting a 1.7% increase compared to a 5% total sales increase. This inventory discipline is key to our ability to continuously flow in the fresh, exciting products our customers expect and extend our full-price selling even further. 
Meanwhile, our inventory turn rate is inching ever closer to the 3x charges we set as our goal several years ago. The income statement and balance sheet performance as we have executed in recent years have positioned us to deliver on the balanced approach to capital allocation, to which we are committed. Specifically, we invested $66 million of capital on the business during the quarter. We execute our elevated capital expenditure program this year. That said, it is probable that we will come in $5 million to $10 million below the $297 million target we set at the beginning of the year, with the shortfall primarily the result of the timing of certain substantial projects related both to stores and infrastructure initiatives. Any shortfall in spending this year will likely roll over to next year.
We also spent $188 million in the quarter to buy back 3.35 million shares, bringing our total year-to-date shareholder returns, including dividends, to $350 million compared to $275 million in the first half of 2015. With the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain that I mentioned we're planning for the third quarter, we will likely see similar operating metrics to that seen so far this year, with gross margin up slightly and a bit of deleverage in SG&A driven by the digital business, leading to an EPS increase, which should be double digits or close to it. 
Our outlook for the full year remains a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and double-digit EPS growth. Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our leadership positions in the industry and highlight a few of the key product trends this quarter."

The goal of any competition, however, and retail is a terrific competit",1482,"Thanks, Lauren. Greetings, everyone. Foot Locker is a leading company. Our vision for many years has been to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. The goal of any competition, however, and retail is a terrific competition each and every day, is not to be leading at the midway point of the race, it's to be the leader at the end. Except in retail, there's never an end to the race. So we strive through our strategic initiatives to build our company to be an enduring retail leader with strengths across a variety of dimensions. 
First and foremost, we must be leaders with our customers. We are leaders in understanding what our customers want and how and when they want it. We spend a tremendous amount of time identifying the key characteristics of the core customers of each of our banners and what makes them want to engage in transacting with us. This work, in turn, makes us a leading partner for our world-class vendors as they create and market the most innovative, athletically inspired products. 
The investments we have made in our store fleet, both in the physical appearance of the stores and the quality of the merchandise assortments, have led to our stores being destinations for our customers. This can be seen in our traffic results, which consistently outpace overall mall or high-speed traffic. 
Our traffic was up in the U.S. this quarter, although it was down somewhat in Europe. Being a strong retail destination positions us as a leading partner with our landlords in the malls and, increasingly, in the prime shopping streets across our global footprint. 
And our most important investments have been in our people, leading us to have, in my opinion, the best talents in retail, including our associates in our stores, in the field and in all of our support facilities. This powerful combination enabled us to build strong leadership positions across the athletic retail industry. Let me first talk about product categories. 
We believe we're the leading retailer of premium sneakers, period. Not just a specific category of sneakers, sneakers, full stop. Yes, we're the leader of basketball. Lauren mentioned the basketball footwear was up mid-single digits. The gains came in a variety of silhouettes, primarily from Jordan Retros, Nike Foamposites, Superstars from Adidas and certain signature basketball shoes, such as Kyrie Irving from Nike and Stephen Curry from Under Armour, to call out a few. 
We were up in running footwear, where we also lead the market. The category here was led by lifestyle products, such as the established Roshe and Huarache programs from Nike with goal driven especially by Nomad and Ultra Boost from Adidas and the Presto from Nike. 
Finally, we lead the market in sales of various casual and premium classic shoes. This quarter, some the standout styles were Stan Smiths from Adidas and Puma Suedes and peers. We have strong inventory positions as well as important exclusives and collaborations in many of these classic styles just as we do in running and basketball. Our vendors know that our banners provide the perfect battlegrounds to fight it out to win market share, especially with the young male customers who buy the most sneakers and who are the style influencers for the rest of their generation and, increasingly, for the rest of us, since every day, it seems more and more adults are wearing sneakers, too. And that's why the leading brands continue to be highly motivated to collaborate with us on these exclusives and strong allocations. 
We're a leading retail of premium athletic footwear and apparel, not just in the U.S., but also across Western Europe, Canada and Australia. Lauren mentioned that the Foot Locker banner was up mid-single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific, but what she didn't mention is that both of those gains came on top of strong double-digit gains 1 year ago, leading to 2-year stacked gains close to 20%. 
Running is the leading product category in both of those divisions, by the way, not basketball. And Canada's double-digit comp gain this year also came on top the double-digit gain last year. Those are definitely all industry-leading performances. They're not just leaders in store productivity, but our digital businesses are approaching annual sales of $1 billion, as we continue to connect with our customers often multiple times on their journey to selecting their favorite sneaker or piece of apparel. Those connections are more and more often happening on mobile devices, where we lead in social media interaction, including some of the newer platforms, such as Instagram Stories, Facebook Live and Snapchat. Right now, you can check out the recent exclusive Twitter Q&A we hosted with James Harden. And next week, we are partnering in the launch of the Bitmoji app. We have Foot Locker House of Hoops, Foot Locker House of Hoops and SIX:02 stores within Bitmoji fashion, where customers can update their avatars with the latest products from Nike, Adidas and others. 
Finally, I want to mention that we've been hard at work creating what I believe will be the leading destination for the best in athletic footwear and apparel, and accessories, right here in Midtown Manhattan. Our flagship store at 34th Street is slated to reopen in a matter of days, and we couldn't be more excited about it. The space will include not just pinnacle footwear experiences, but also new and exciting presence for SIX:02 here in the city as well as partnership spaces with multiple vendors. The details are still a bit under wraps, but rest assured, there will be plenty of fanfare about it soon. So please look for that over the next couple of weeks. And if you're in the area, you should visit the store once it opens. 
All of these efforts I've just described led to the strong financial performance we have produced over the last 6.5 years, which has in turn, enabled us to provide industry-leading shareholder returns including the elevated share repurchases Lauren described earlier. Yet, we feel our work has just begun. 
As I said before, the competition in retail is never over, and we still have a long way to go to reach most of the 2020 objectives we laid out at the beginning of last year. 
Within our solid growth plan, we have initiatives that are delivering excellent results now, such as expanding the kids business globally, building up of Foot Locker banner in Europe and growing our digital business. Plus, our core business of selling athletic footwear to young males in the U.S. is making steady progress towards the productivity objectives embedded in our long-term goals based in large measure on the remodel program we continue to execute. 
Meanwhile, we're making real headway in the apparel business, as seen especially by the strong results in Europe and the turnaround in Champs Sports. It will still take some time for our improvements in the apparel to substantially move the needle. So I see this as a very important intermediate term opportunity for the company, along with the turnaround in the Runners Point and Sidestep banners we're working on diligently. 
Finally, the women's business remains a tremendous long-term opportunity. As I said, we're excited to bring SIX:02 to New York City in a few days with another key shop opening in our Times Square location towards the end of the year. And if you're not in New York or near any of our other SIX:02 stores, you can see the exciting progress we're making at six02.com. 
We will keep partnering with our vendors to create and deliver the exciting lifestyle products connected with the meaningful assets, to which our female customers have responded enthusiastically. Although we've known all along it will take quite some time to build the business profitably to scale, we do have some exciting product and marketing initiatives coming in the near term. These include a continued and enhanced relationship with Puma featuring [indiscernible] products that we believe will help give the SIX:02 brand an immediate momentum boost. 
Before we get to your questions, I must thank the excellent team of associates we have at Foot Locker for producing yet another record quarter. The second quarter used to be our toughest quarter. In fact, it still is. But now, instead of barely breaking even in the second quarter, as we did early on in our journey, this year, we earned $127 million or $0.94 per share. It took a lot of excellent teamwork over several years to get us to this level of performance. 
So as we look to the future and how we can improve the business even further, I have to acknowledge all the tremendously good work done by everyone that went into producing the high-quality, industry-leading results that we announced today. Thank you all very much. Beatrice, let's open the phone call for questions."

We believe there's only a couple of places in the mall that people will line up for products. One of them is a Foot Locker family store and one of them is the Apple Store. So we know that our customers, our core consumers, want to be in our stores. So the anchors, certainly, there's some lease ramifications when anchors close. But our focus is more on the connectivity with our consumer, the engagement we have with our consumer, building exciting places to shop and buy. They interact with us digitally on their way to the mall. They, in the mall, will take a photo of the sneaker on their foot, and they'll tweet it out or they'll send it out to their group of friends and get the responses back. So the anchor is closing as a change in the -- certainly, in the makeup of the malls. But our consumer's still driven to the malls as a place for social interaction with their friends. So we're confident that regardless of anchor positioning, we should continue to drive traffic into the malls. And we have success on both ends of the spectrum, I think, was the second part of your question, Matt, whether it's an A mall, where we have premium placement and great shopping environment, or a B mall, where the mall environment isn't quite the same as those A malls, but our core consumer shops there, and our associates are definitely engaged with the consumers across the entire spectrum.

And that's the 34th Street store that we'll see open in the next couple of weeks and then Times Square, which will have a SIX:02 shop within it that will open, hopefully, by the end of the year. So that was a decision that we made to slow down the store rollout, to make sure that we get those 2 doors right. The SIX:02 team has done a great job of bringing in some new brands, catching up with the lifestyle side of the equation. Again, this female consumer that we're after is very discerning in that she expects all of the performance elements to be present in every piece that she buys, everything that she buys. But it's got to be very stylish, and we've got some great new brands. And the best place to sort of see and measure the progress if you're not near a SIX:02 store is on six02.com. And you can see some of the great showcased products that we've got there. So the intent would be to make sure that we've got the assortment right with some of the exciting things that we're going to see in 34th Street in Times Square. We've got the physical space right. And then we'll likely accelerate door count when we get into 2017. And we've said all along that this is a really competitive marketplace. So yes, I mean, the fashion is changing, the look is changing, the response and reaction to some of the asset-driven models are changing. So it's -- she's a very discerning, very quick-moving customer, and we're trying to capture her interest and get her engaged with the SIX:02 brand. It's been a little bit difficult with only 30 doors, so I'm a firm believer that the excitement that's going to be generated out the doors here in the city will certainly give a big momentum push, as will some of the good work that we're going to do with some of our key vendor partners in the SIX:02 space to drive real energy around that banner."

Because none of our banners performed well in the economy with some of the traffic issues that we saw. But from a broader perspective, we're repositioning both Runners Point and Sidestep. And we did some -- you know how we operate. We test things pretty significantly before we go ahead and roll them out. And the test that we saw back in 2014, where we positioned Runners Point was all things runner -- running and Sidestep more on the lifestyle end of the spectrum, with our Foot Locker banner right in between, the results in 2014 were pretty positive. And they convinced us that we could go ahead with that. In hindsight, what we found is there were a couple of really significant silhouettes that were driving the running side of the business, especially in Germany, right? Each market in Western Europe is different, and Germany was definitely locked on to a couple of key silhouettes that have fallen out of favor a bit. So it really caused -- first, we fired a bunch of customers from Runners Point because we took out the vulcanized shoes, we took out the skate shoes, we took out the boots and we really focused it on the running consumer. And then that running consumer moved off a couple of the key silhouettes that had really been propping up the results. So it's an assortment mix. It's a brand mix. And I think the team in Recklinghausen is addressing it as quickly as they can with the vendor partners. And then the other piece is on the Sidestep side of the house, making sure that we've got the right lifestyle piece of it and a little bit more fashion forward. So we -- we've got work to do there but the team is diligently working on it. We spent a little time over in Germany this summer, and we see some progress. But we do definitely have work to do."

Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will start us off by discussing the company's second quarter financial performance; followed by Dick Johnson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss the various strengths Foot Locker has in the athletic industry and highlight some key product trends. After that, we'll be happy to get to your questions. Lauren?"

As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas w",1440,"Thank you, John. Good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Foot Locker. Well, overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business. 
As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas where traction was somewhat elusive. Starting on the positive side of the ledger, Foot Locker Canada again led our store division, followed closely by Champs Sports, both with low double-digit comparable sales gains. Foot Locker Canada pulled off a hat trick, with double-digit gains in footwear, apparel and accessories. Champs Sports posted gains in all 3 areas, too, representing an important inflection point for Champs, where apparel and accessories constitute the largest sales penetration of any of our banners.
Several store divisions produced comp gains in the mid single-digit range, including Foot Locker in the U.S. As we noted on the last call, our flagship Foot Locker store on 34th Street was closed for the entire quarter, negatively impacting the total company comp by a few ticks. Ticks meaning tenths of basis points. The Foot Locker U.S. division itself was impacted by more than 100 basis points. So we are pleased with how well the Foot Locker team in the U.S. navigated that headwind.
Foot Locker Europe, Foot Locker Asia Pacific and Footaction were the other divisions with mid-single-digit comps. With the performance of some exciting new stores, such as State Street in Chicago, Footaction in total generated a double-digit sales increase. 
The strategy to expand our leading position in the kids business continues to be a major contributor to our success. The Kids Foot Locker itself produced a low single-digit comp increase. With the net addition of 26 stores, total sales were up almost 10%. 
The sales of children's footwear and our other banners were up double digit. Lady Foot Locker SIX:02, comped down low mid-single, unfortunately, breaking its 2-year streak of comp gain. Although footwear sales continued to be strong, apparel was down double digits. Lifestyle apparel sold well, but we didn't keep pace with the rapid shift out of performance styles by our female customers. 
Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to run off double digits, pressured by traffic declines that seemed to be at least in part a function of local events in Germany. Traffic was also down in our Foot Locker stores in Germany, and Foot Locker sales were softer there than in most other markets. 
Turning to our direct-to-customer segment. The business overall comped up 7.1%. Sales by our store banner.com businesses in the U.S. increased in the teens, with significantly higher growth rates for Foot Locker's digital businesses in Europe and Canada. On the negative side of the ledger, Eastbay continues to struggle, with sales declining high single digits. The shift away from performance continued to challenge this very sports-focused banner as did the heightened sporting goods liquidation activity that went on during the quarter.
For the total company, footwear continued to be the standout category, with an overall gain in the upper end of mid-single digits. Running was up mid-single digit and so was basketball, while court classic and casual styles led the way with high single-digit gain. The fairly consistent sales result across footwear categories this quarter is yet another excellent example of our ability to navigate the never-ending shifts in style preferences of our customers, who continue to look to our stores and online sites for the most innovative, trend-right sneakers. They know they can count on us to have what's hot, or should I say what's cool. Maintaining the trend of recent quarters, both average selling prices and units were up in footwear during the quarter. While in apparel, ASPs were up and units were down, reflecting our ongoing shift to more premium apparel assortment. 
Our apparel business continues to improve, with men's apparel, by far the largest piece of the category for us, up mid-single digit, and kids apparel up double digits. 
The women's side, as I mentioned before, was challenged, as were accessories. The sock business was the main culprit in accessories, still running down double digits, although we generated gains in hats, bags and shoe care products. You'll recall that when we gave you our quarter-to-date comp result back in May, we were running negative, but we said we expected the month of May to end positive, which is in fact what happened. We then had a very strong June, up high single digits, with July up mid-single digits. The overall result was the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain to which we guided early in the quarter.
After looking at the relationship over time of our quarter-to-date comp with our finished comps for the quarter and by listening to many of you, we have concluded that our quarter-to-date results as of the time of our calls are not useful indicators of the expected pace of business for the total quarter. And so after this call, we will no longer provide the quarter-to-date comp. 
Rest assured the quarter-to-date comp, whatever it is, will be factored into the comp guidance we do provide you for the upcoming quarter. If there are some special short-term effects that warrant calling out, we will do so. But between launch shifts, holidays, payday shifts and the like, we believe providing early quarter-to-date comps does not add value to understanding our business. That said, for this final mention of quarter-to-date comp, they are up mid-single digits, in line with our expectation for comparable sales to be up mid-single digits for the full quarter.
Turning now to the rest of the income statement. John mentioned the strong gross margin rate, which was 33% for the quarter, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gains were driven by lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decline in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. 
In response to the competitive environment and a softening of traffic to our U.S. website, we were more promotional in our digital businesses than we had expected heading into the quarter. 
We also spent more to drive traffic to our website, which contributed to a slight deleverage of our SG&A in the quarter to 19.7%. Overall, we had very good expense management, especially in store wages. However, as we noted on the call in May, with 2 of our biggest stores closed for the entire duration of what is already our lowest sales volume quarter, our leverage point was challenged. 
Depreciation expense continued to trend up as a result of our ongoing investment in customer experience, both in-store and digital, while our tax rate continued to run slightly below our plan due to the proportionately higher mix of income from our international operations relative to the U.S. 
We continued to manage inventory very closely, posting a 1.7% increase compared to a 5% total sales increase. This inventory discipline is key to our ability to continuously flow in the fresh, exciting products our customers expect and extend our full-price selling even further. 
Meanwhile, our inventory turn rate is inching ever closer to the 3x target we set as our goal several years ago. The income statement and balance sheet performances we have executed in recent years have positioned us to deliver on the balanced approach to capital allocation to which we are committed. Specifically, we invested $66 million of capital in the business during the quarter, to execute our elevated capital expenditure program this year. That said, it is probable that we will come in $5 million to $10 million below the $297 million target we set at the beginning of the year, with the shortfall primarily the result of the timing of certain substantial projects related both to stores and infrastructure initiatives. Any shortfall in spending this year will likely roll over to next year.
We also spent $188 million in the quarter to buy back 3.35 million shares, bringing our total year-to-date shareholder returns, including dividends, to $350 million compared to $275 million in the first half of 2015. With the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain that I mentioned we're planning for the third quarter, we will likely see similar operating metrics to that seen so far this year, with gross margin up slightly and a bit of deleverage in SG&A driven by the digital business, leading to an EPS increase, which should be double digits or close to it. 
Our outlook for the full year remains a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and double-digit EPS growth. Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our leadership position in the industry and highlight a few of the key product trends in the quarter."

Our vision for many years has been to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. The goal of any competition, however, and retail is a terrific competition each and every day, is not to be leading at the midway point of the race, it's to be the leader at the end. Except in retail, there's never an end to the race. So we strive through our strategic initiatives to build our company to be an enduring retail leader with strengths across a variety of dimensions. 
First and foremost, we must be leaders with our customers. We are leaders in understanding what our customers want and how and when they want it. We spend a tremendous amount of time identifying the key characteristics of the core customers of each of our banners and what makes them want to engage and transact with us. This work, in turn, makes us a leading partner for our world-class vendors as they create and market the most innovative, athletically inspired products. 
The investments we have made in our store fleet, both in the physical appearance of the stores and the quality of the merchandise assortments, have led to our stores being destinations for our customers. This can be seen in our traffic results, which consistently outpace overall mall or High Street traffic. 
Our traffic was up in the U.S. this quarter, although it was down somewhat in Europe. Being a strong retail destination positions us as a leading partner with our landlords in the malls and, increasingly, in the prime shopping streets across our global footprint. 
And our most important investments have been in our people, leading us to have, in my opinion, the best talent in retail, including our associates in our stores, in the field and in all of our support facilities. This powerful combination enabled us to build strong leadership positions across the athletic retail industry. Let me first talk about product categories. 
We believe we're the leading retailer of premium sneakers, period. Not just a specific category of sneakers: sneakers, full stop. Yes, we're the leader of basketball. Lauren mentioned the basketball footwear was up mid-single digits. The gains came in a variety of silhouettes, primarily from Jordan Retros, Nike Foamposites, Superstars from adidas and certain signature basketball shoes, such as Kyrie Irving from Nike and Stephen Curry from Under Armour, to call out a few. 
We were up in running footwear, where we also lead the market. The category here was led by lifestyle products such as the established Roshe and Huarache programs from Nike, with growth driven especially by Nomad and Ultra Boost from adidas and the Presto from Nike. 
Finally, we lead the market in sales of various casual and premium classic shoes. This quarter, some the standout styles were Stan Smiths from adidas and Puma Suedes and Fierce. We have strong inventory positions as well as important exclusives and collaborations in many of these classic styles just as we do in running and basketball. Our vendors know that our banners provide the perfect battleground to fight it out to win market share, especially with the young male customers who buy the most sneakers and who are the style influencers for the rest of their generations and, increasingly, for the rest of us, since every day, it seems more and more adults are wearing sneakers, too. And that's why the leading brands continue to be highly motivated to collaborate with us on these exclusives and strong allocations. 
We're a leading retail of premium athletic footwear and apparel, not just in the U.S., but also across Western Europe, Canada and Australia. Lauren mentioned that the Foot Locker banner was up mid-single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific, but what she didn't mention is that both of those gains came on top of strong double-digit gains 1 year ago, leading to 2-year stacked gains close to 20%. 
Running is the leading product category in both of those divisions, by the way, not basketball. And Canada's double-digit comp gain this year also came on top the double-digit gain last year. Those are definitely all industry-leading performances. We're not just leaders in store productivity, but our digital businesses are approaching annual sales of $1 billion, as we continue to connect with our customers often multiple times on their journey to selecting their favorite sneaker or piece of apparel. Those connections are more and more often happening on mobile devices, where we lead in social media interaction, including some of the newer platforms such as Instagram Stories, Facebook Live and Snapchat. Right now, you can check out the recent exclusive Twitter Q&A we hosted with James Harden. And next week, we are partnering in the launch of the Bitmoji app. We'll have Foot Locker House of Hoops, Foot Locker House of Hoops and SIX:02 stores within Bitmoji fashion, where customers can outfit their avatars in the latest products from Nike, adidas and others. 
Finally, I want to mention that we've been hard at work creating what I believe will be the leading destination for the best in athletic footwear and apparel and accessories, right here in Midtown Manhattan. Our flagship store on 34th Street is slated to reopen in a matter of days, and we couldn't be more excited about it. The space will include not just pinnacle footwear experiences, but also a new and exciting presence for SIX:02 here in the city as well as partnership spaces with multiple vendors. The details are still a bit under wraps, but rest assured, there will be plenty of fanfare about it soon. So please look for that over the next couple of weeks. And if you're in the area, be sure to visit the store once it opens. 
All of these efforts I've just described have led to the strong financial performance we have produced over the last 6.5 years, which has in turn, enabled us to provide industry-leading shareholder returns including the elevated share repurchases Lauren described earlier. Yet, we feel our work has just begun. 
As I said before, the competition in retail is never over, and we still have a long way to go to reach most of the 2020 objectives we laid out at the beginning of last year. 
Within our solid growth plan, we have initiatives that are delivering excellent results now, such as expanding the kids business globally, building out the Foot Locker banner in Europe and growing our digital business. Plus, our core business of selling athletic footwear to young males in the U.S. is making steady progress towards the productivity objectives embedded in our long-term goals based in large measure on the remodel program we continue to execute. 
Meanwhile, we're making real headway in the apparel business, as seen especially by the strong results in Europe and the turnaround in Champs Sports. It will still take some time for our improvements in apparel to substantially move the needle. So I see this as a very important intermediate term opportunity for the company, along with the turnaround in the Runners Point and Sidestep banners we're working on diligently. 
Finally, the women's business remains a tremendous long-term opportunity. As I said, we're excited to bring SIX:02 to New York City in a few days with another key shop opening in our Times Square location towards the end of the year. And if you're not in New York or near any of our other SIX:02 stores, you can see the exciting progress we're making at six02.com. 
We will keep partnering with our vendors to create and deliver the exciting lifestyle products connected with the meaningful assets to which our female customers have responded enthusiastically. Although we've known all along it will take quite some time to build the business profitably to scale, we do have some exciting product and marketing initiatives coming in the near term. These include a continued and enhanced relationship with Puma featuring Rihanna Fenty products that we believe will help give the SIX:02 brand an immediate momentum boost. 
Before we get to your questions, I must thank the excellent team of associates we have at Foot Locker for producing yet another record quarter. The second quarter used to be our toughest quarter. In fact, it still is. But now, instead of barely breaking even in the second quarter, as we did early on in our journey, this year, we earned $127 million or $0.94 per share. It took a lot of excellent teamwork over several years to get us to this level of performance. 
So as we look to the future and how we can improve the business even further, I have to acknowledge all the tremendously good work done by everyone that went into producing the high-quality, industry-leading results that we announced today. Thank you all very much. Beatrice, let's open the phone call for questions."

We believe there's only a couple of places in the mall that people will line up for products. One of them is a Foot Locker family store and one of them is the Apple Store. So we know that our customers, our core consumers, want to be in our stores. So the anchors, certainly, there's some lease ramifications when anchors close. But our focus is more on the connectivity with our consumer, the engagement we have with our consumer, building exciting places to shop and buy. They interact with us digitally on their way to the mall. They, in the mall, will take a photo of the sneaker on their foot, and they'll tweet it out or they'll send it out to their group of friends and get the responses back. So the anchors closing is a change in the -- certainly, in the makeup of the malls. But our consumer is still driven to the malls as a place for social interaction with their friends. So we're confident that regardless of anchor positioning, we should continue to drive traffic into the malls. And we have success on both ends of the spectrum, I think, was the second part of your question, Matt, whether it's an A mall, where we have premium placement and great shopping environment, or a B mall, where the mall environment isn't quite the same as those A malls.

So the malls are far from dead regardless of what's going on with the anchors."

From a store count perspective, Susan, we've announced -- or we've talked about the last few quarters, that we slowed down our store development here in 2016, because we've got 2 very significant properties that we're going to open in New York City to give our SIX:02 banner a real presence in the city. And that's the 34th Street store that we'll see open in the next couple of weeks and then Times Square, which will have a SIX:02 shop within it that will open, hopefully, by the end of the year. So that was a decision that we made to slow down the store rollout, to make sure that we get those 2 doors right. The SIX:02 team has done a great job of bringing in some new brands, catching up with the lifestyle side of the equation. Again, this female consumer that we're after is very discerning in that she expects all of the performance elements to be present in every piece that she buys, everything that she buys. But it's got to be very stylish, and we've got some great new brands. And the best place to sort of see and measure the progress if you're not near a SIX:02 store is on six02.com. And you can see some of the great showcase product that we've got there. So the intent would be to make sure that we've got the assortment right with some of the exciting things that we're going to see in 34th Street and Times Square. We've got the physical space right. And then we'll likely accelerate door count when we get into 2017. And we've said all along that this is a really competitive marketplace. So yes, I mean, the fashion is changing, the look is changing, the response and reaction to some of the asset-driven models are changing. So it's -- she's a very discerning, very quick-moving customer, and we're trying to capture her interest and get her engaged with the SIX:02 brand. It's been a little bit difficult with only 30 doors, so I'm a firm believer that the excitement that's going to be generated out the doors here in the city will certainly give a big momentum push, as will some of the good work that we're going to do with some of our key vendor partners in the SIX:02 space to drive real energy around that banner."

Maybe not at the same price points that the special product for the Olympians has been built to, but at price points that are meaningful and commercializable in our stores. So there's excitement around the Olympics, certainly. We have some very clear country-related and Olympic colored product in the stores, and there's been great response to that. But that's not what really moves the needle. It's the aftereffect. And you'll see some of the great -- if you've been watching any of the track and field, there's an awful lot of great Nike product on the feet of a lot of the sprinters and distance runners that will certainly be in the Eastbay catalog, same thing with the stuff from adidas and PUMA; obviously, PUMA, with Usain Bolt and the great performance that he's had; the branding presence that you've seen from Under Armor. All those things are going to be positives to the business in the back half of the year."

Because none of our banners performed well in the economy with some of the traffic issues that we saw. But from a broader perspective, we're repositioning both Runners Point and Sidestep. And we did some -- you know how we operate. We test things pretty significantly before we go ahead and roll them out. And the tests that we saw back in 2014, where we positioned Runners Point was all things runner -- running and Sidestep more on the lifestyle end of the spectrum, with our Foot Locker banner right in between, the results in 2014 were pretty positive. And they convinced us that we could go ahead with that. In hindsight, what we found is there were a couple of really significant silhouettes that were driving the running side of the business, especially in Germany, right? Each market in Western Europe is different, and Germany was definitely locked on to a couple of key silhouettes that have fallen out of favor a bit. So it really caused -- first, we fired a bunch of customers from Runners Point because we took out the vulcanized shoes, we took out the skate shoes, we took out the boots and we really focused it on the running consumer. And then that running consumer moved off a couple of the key silhouettes that had really been propping up the results. So it's an assortment mix. It's a brand mix. And I think the team in Recklinghausen is addressing it as quickly as they can with the vendor partners. And then the other piece is on the Sidestep side of the house, making sure that we've got the right lifestyle piece of it and a little bit more fashion forward. So we've got work to do there but the team is diligently working on it. We spent a little time over in Germany this summer, and we see some progress. But we do definitely have work to do."

Good morning to everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm pleased to report that the company achieved net income of $127 million in the quarter on the strength of a 4.7% comparable sales gain and an improved gross margin rate. 
Earnings per share came in at $0.94, up 12% from a year ago, and 47% up above our EPS 2 years ago, as we continue to drive consistent improvements in operating and financial performance over the long term. 
In fact, this quarter was the 26th consecutive quarter with meaningful sales and profit gains over the prior year period. The strong second quarter result brought our year-to-date earnings to $318 million or $2.33 per share, a 9% increase over a year ago and the best start to a year in Foot Locker's history. Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will start us off by discussing the company's second quarter financial performance; followed by Dick Johnson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss the various strengths Foot Locker has in the athletic industry and highlight some key product trends.

Well, overall, the second quarter finished near where we planned the business. 
As usual, there were some performances that stood above the rest and other areas where traction was somewhat elusive. Starting on the positive side of the ledger, Foot Locker Canada again led our store division, followed closely by Champs Sports, both with low double-digit comparable sales gains. Foot Locker Canada pulled off a hat trick, with double-digit gains in footwear, apparel and accessories. Champs Sports posted gains in all 3 areas, too, representing an important inflection point for Champs, where apparel and accessories constitute the largest sales penetration of any of our banners.
Several store divisions produced comp gains in the mid-single-digit range, including Foot Locker in the U.S. As we noted on the last call, our flagship Foot Locker store on 34th Street was closed for the entire quarter, negatively impacting the total company comp by a few ticks. Ticks meaning tenths of basis points. The Foot Locker U.S. division itself was impacted by more than 100 basis points. So we are pleased with how well the Foot Locker team in the U.S. navigated that headwind.
Foot Locker Europe, Foot Locker Asia Pacific and Footaction were the other divisions with mid-single-digit comps. With the performance of some exciting new stores, such as State Street in Chicago, Footaction in total generated a double-digit sales increase. 
The strategy to expand our leading position in the kids business continues to be a major contributor to our success. The Kids Foot Locker itself produced a low single-digit comp increase. With the net addition of 26 stores, total sales were up almost 10%. 
The sales of children's footwear and our other banners were up double digit. Lady Foot Locker SIX:02, comped down low mid-single, unfortunately, breaking its 2-year streak of comp gain. Although footwear sales continued to be strong, apparel was down double digits. Lifestyle apparel sold well, but we didn't keep pace with the rapid shift out of performance styles by our female customers. 
Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to run off double digits, pressured by traffic declines that seemed to be at least in part a function of local events in Germany. Traffic was also down in our Foot Locker stores in Germany, and Foot Locker sales were softer there than in most other markets. 
Turning to our direct-to-customer segment. The business overall comped up 7.1%. Sales by our store banner.com businesses in the U.S. increased in the teens, with significantly higher growth rates for Foot Locker's digital businesses in Europe and Canada. On the negative side of the ledger, Eastbay continues to struggle, with sales declining high single digits. The shift away from performance continued to challenge this very sports-focused banner as did the heightened sporting goods liquidation activity that went on during the quarter.
For the total company, footwear continued to be the standout category, with an overall gain in the upper end of mid-single digits. Running was up mid-single digit and so was basketball, while court classic and casual styles led the way with high single-digit gain. The fairly consistent sales result across footwear categories this quarter is yet another excellent example of our ability to navigate the never-ending shifts in style preferences of our customers, who continue to look to our stores and online sites for the most innovative, trend-right sneakers. They know they can count on us to have what's hot, or should I say what's cool. Maintaining the trend of recent quarters, both average selling prices and units were up in footwear during the quarter. While in apparel, ASPs were up and units were down, reflecting our ongoing shift to more premium apparel assortment. 
Our apparel business continues to improve, with men's apparel, by far the largest piece of the category for us, up mid-single digit, and kids apparel up double digits. 
The women's side, as I mentioned before, was challenged, as were accessories. The sock business was the main culprit in accessories, still running down double digits, although we generated gains in hats, bags and shoe care products. You'll recall that when we gave you our quarter-to-date comp result back in May, we were running negative, but we said we expected the month of May to end positive, which is in fact what happened. We then had a very strong June, up high single digits, with July up mid-single digits. The overall result was the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain to which we guided early in the quarter.
After looking at the relationship over time of our quarter-to-date comp with our finished comps for the quarter and by listening to many of you, we have concluded that our quarter-to-date results as of the time of our calls are not useful indicators of the expected pace of business for the total quarter. And so after this call, we will no longer provide the quarter-to-date comp. 
Rest assured the quarter-to-date comp, whatever it is, will be factored into the comp guidance we do provide you for the upcoming quarter. If there are some special short-term effects that warrant calling out, we will do so. But between launch shifts, holidays, payday shifts and the like, we believe providing early quarter-to-date comps does not add value to understanding our business. That said, for this final mention of quarter-to-date comp, they are up mid-single digits, in line with our expectation for comparable sales to be up mid-single digits for the full quarter.
Turning now to the rest of the income statement. John mentioned the strong gross margin rate, which was 33% for the quarter, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gains were driven by lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decline in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. 
In response to the competitive environment and a softening of traffic to our U.S. website, we were more promotional in our digital businesses than we had expected heading into the quarter. 
We also spent more to drive traffic to our website, which contributed to a slight deleverage of our SG&A in the quarter to 19.7%. Overall, we had very good expense management, especially in store wages. However, as we noted on the call in May, with 2 of our biggest stores closed for the entire duration of what is already our lowest sales volume quarter, our leverage point was challenged. 
Depreciation expense continued to trend up as a result of our ongoing investment in customer experience, both in-store and digital, while our tax rate continued to run slightly below our plan due to the proportionately higher mix of income from our international operations relative to the U.S. 
We continued to manage inventory very closely, posting a 1.7% increase compared to a 5% total sales increase. This inventory discipline is key to our ability to continuously flow in the fresh, exciting products our customers expect and extend our full-price selling even further. 
Meanwhile, our inventory turn rate is inching ever closer to the 3x target we set as our goal several years ago. The income statement and balance sheet performances we have executed in recent years have positioned us to deliver on the balanced approach to capital allocation to which we are committed. Specifically, we invested $66 million of capital in the business during the quarter, to execute our elevated capital expenditure program this year. That said, it is probable that we will come in $5 million to $10 million below the $297 million target we set at the beginning of the year, with the shortfall primarily the result of the timing of certain substantial projects related both to stores and infrastructure initiatives. Any shortfall in spending this year will likely roll over to next year.
We also spent $188 million in the quarter to buy back 3.35 million shares, bringing our total year-to-date shareholder returns, including dividends, to $350 million compared to $275 million in the first half of 2015. With the mid-single-digit comparable sales gain that I mentioned we're planning for the third quarter, we will likely see similar operating metrics to that seen so far this year, with gross margin up slightly and a bit of deleverage in SG&A driven by the digital business, leading to an EPS increase, which should be double digits or close to it. 
Our outlook for the full year remains a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and double-digit EPS growth. Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our leadership position in the industry and highlight a few of the key product trends in the quarter."

The goal of any competition, however, and retail is a terrific competit",1486,"Thanks, Lauren. Greetings, everyone. Foot Locker is a leading company. Our vision for many years has been to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. The goal of any competition, however, and retail is a terrific competition each and every day, is not to be leading at the midway point of the race, it's to be the leader at the end. Except in retail, there's never an end to the race. So we strive through our strategic initiatives to build our company to be an enduring retail leader with strengths across a variety of dimensions. 
First and foremost, we must be leaders with our customers. We are leaders in understanding what our customers want and how and when they want it. We spend a tremendous amount of time identifying the key characteristics of the core customers of each of our banners and what makes them want to engage and transact with us. This work, in turn, makes us a leading partner for our world-class vendors as they create and market the most innovative, athletically inspired products. 
The investments we have made in our store fleet, both in the physical appearance of the stores and the quality of the merchandise assortments, have led to our stores being destinations for our customers. This can be seen in our traffic results, which consistently outpace overall mall or High Street traffic. 
Our traffic was up in the U.S. this quarter, although it was down somewhat in Europe. Being a strong retail destination positions us as a leading partner with our landlords in the malls and, increasingly, in the prime shopping streets across our global footprint. 
And our most important investments have been in our people, leading us to have, in my opinion, the best talent in retail, including our associates in our stores, in the field and in all of our support facilities. This powerful combination enabled us to build strong leadership positions across the athletic retail industry. Let me first talk about product categories. 
We believe we're the leading retailer of premium sneakers, period. Not just a specific category of sneakers: sneakers, full stop. Yes, we're the leader of basketball. Lauren mentioned the basketball footwear was up mid-single digits. The gains came in a variety of silhouettes, primarily from Jordan Retros, Nike Foamposites, Superstars from adidas and certain signature basketball shoes, such as Kyrie Irving from Nike and Stephen Curry from Under Armour, to call out a few. 
We were up in running footwear, where we also lead the market. The category here was led by lifestyle products such as the established Roshe and Huarache programs from Nike, with growth driven especially by Nomad and Ultra Boost from adidas and the Presto from Nike. 
Finally, we lead the market in sales of various casual and premium classic shoes. This quarter, some the standout styles were Stan Smiths from adidas and Puma Suedes and Fierce. We have strong inventory positions as well as important exclusives and collaborations in many of these classic styles just as we do in running and basketball. Our vendors know that our banners provide the perfect battleground to fight it out to win market share, especially with the young male customers who buy the most sneakers and who are the style influencers for the rest of their generations and, increasingly, for the rest of us, since every day, it seems more and more adults are wearing sneakers, too. And that's why the leading brands continue to be highly motivated to collaborate with us on these exclusives and strong allocations. 
We're a leading retail of premium athletic footwear and apparel, not just in the U.S., but also across Western Europe, Canada and Australia. Lauren mentioned that the Foot Locker banner was up mid-single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific, but what she didn't mention is that both of those gains came on top of strong double-digit gains 1 year ago, leading to 2-year stacked gains close to 20%. 
Running is the leading product category in both of those divisions, by the way, not basketball. And Canada's double-digit comp gain this year also came on top the double-digit gain last year. Those are definitely all industry-leading performances. We're not just leaders in store productivity, but our digital businesses are approaching annual sales of $1 billion, as we continue to connect with our customers often multiple times on their journey to selecting their favorite sneaker or piece of apparel. Those connections are more and more often happening on mobile devices, where we lead in social media interaction, including some of the newer platforms such as Instagram Stories, Facebook Live and Snapchat. Right now, you can check out the recent exclusive Twitter Q&A we hosted with James Harden. And next week, we are partnering in the launch of the Bitmoji app. We'll have Foot Locker House of Hoops, Foot Locker House of Hoops and SIX:02 stores within Bitmoji fashion, where customers can outfit their avatars in the latest products from Nike, adidas and others. 
Finally, I want to mention that we've been hard at work creating what I believe will be the leading destination for the best in athletic footwear and apparel and accessories, right here in Midtown Manhattan. Our flagship store on 34th Street is slated to reopen in a matter of days, and we couldn't be more excited about it. The space will include not just pinnacle footwear experiences, but also a new and exciting presence for SIX:02 here in the city as well as partnership spaces with multiple vendors. The details are still a bit under wraps, but rest assured, there will be plenty of fanfare about it soon. So please look for that over the next couple of weeks. And if you're in the area, be sure to visit the store once it opens. 
All of these efforts I've just described have led to the strong financial performance we have produced over the last 6.5 years, which has in turn, enabled us to provide industry-leading shareholder returns including the elevated share repurchases Lauren described earlier. Yet, we feel our work has just begun. 
As I said before, the competition in retail is never over, and we still have a long way to go to reach most of the 2020 objectives we laid out at the beginning of last year. 
Within our solid growth plan, we have initiatives that are delivering excellent results now, such as expanding the kids business globally, building out the Foot Locker banner in Europe and growing our digital business. Plus, our core business of selling athletic footwear to young males in the U.S. is making steady progress towards the productivity objectives embedded in our long-term goals based in large measure on the remodel program we continue to execute. 
Meanwhile, we're making real headway in the apparel business, as seen especially by the strong results in Europe and the turnaround in Champs Sports. It will still take some time for our improvements in apparel to substantially move the needle. So I see this as a very important intermediate term opportunity for the company, along with the turnaround in the Runners Point and Sidestep banners we're working on diligently. 
Finally, the women's business remains a tremendous long-term opportunity. As I said, we're excited to bring SIX:02 to New York City in a few days with another key shop opening in our Times Square location towards the end of the year. And if you're not in New York or near any of our other SIX:02 stores, you can see the exciting progress we're making at six02.com. 
We will keep partnering with our vendors to create and deliver the exciting lifestyle products connected with the meaningful assets to which our female customers have responded enthusiastically. Although we've known all along it will take quite some time to build the business profitably to scale, we do have some exciting product and marketing initiatives coming in the near term. These include a continued and enhanced relationship with Puma featuring Rihanna Fenty products that we believe will help give the SIX:02 brand an immediate momentum boost. 
Before we get to your questions, I must thank the excellent team of associates we have at Foot Locker for producing yet another record quarter. The second quarter used to be our toughest quarter. In fact, it still is. But now, instead of barely breaking even in the second quarter, as we did early on in our journey, this year, we earned $127 million or $0.94 per share. It took a lot of excellent teamwork over several years to get us to this level of performance. 
So as we look to the future and how we can improve the business even further, I have to acknowledge all the tremendously good work done by everyone that went into producing the high-quality, industry-leading results that we announced today. Thank you all very much. Beatrice, let's open the phone call for questions."

We believe there's only a couple of places in the mall that people will line up for products. One of them is a Foot Locker family store and one of them is the Apple Store. So we know that our customers, our core consumers, want to be in our stores. So the anchors, certainly, there's some lease ramifications when anchors close. But our focus is more on the connectivity with our consumer, the engagement we have with our consumer, building exciting places to shop and buy. They interact with us digitally on their way to the mall. They, in the mall, will take a photo of the sneaker on their foot, and they'll tweet it out or they'll send it out to their group of friends and get the responses back. So the anchors closing is a change in the -- certainly, in the makeup of the malls. But our consumer is still driven to the malls as a place for social interaction with their friends. So we're confident that regardless of anchor positioning, we should continue to drive traffic into the malls. And we have success on both ends of the spectrum, I think, was the second part of your question, Matt, whether it's an A mall, where we have premium placement and great shopping environment, or a B mall, where the mall environment isn't quite the same as those A malls. But our core consumer shops there, and our associates are definitely engaged with the consumers across the entire spectrum. So the malls are far from dead regardless of what's going on with the anchors."

I certainly would not think of preempting some of the good work that they're doing and talking about it before they talk about it.

From a store count perspective, Susan, we've announced -- or we've talked about the last few quarters, that we slowed down our store development here in 2016, because we've got 2 very significant properties that we're going to open in New York City to give our SIX:02 banner a real presence in the city. And that's the 34th Street store that we'll see open in the next couple of weeks and then Times Square, which will have a SIX:02 shop within it that will open, hopefully, by the end of the year. So that was a decision that we made to slow down the store rollout, to make sure that we get those 2 doors right. The SIX:02 team has done a great job of bringing in some new brands, catching up with the lifestyle side of the equation. Again, this female consumer that we're after is very discerning in that she expects all of the performance elements to be present in every piece that she buys, everything that she buys. But it's got to be very stylish, and we've got some great new brands. And the best place to sort of see and measure the progress if you're not near a SIX:02 store is on six02.com. And you can see some of the great showcase product that we've got there. So the intent would be to make sure that we've got the assortment right with some of the exciting things that we're going to see in 34th Street and Times Square. We've got the physical space right. And then we'll likely accelerate door count when we get into 2017. And we've said all along that this is a really competitive marketplace. So yes, I mean, the fashion is changing, the look is changing, the response and reaction to some of the asset-driven models are changing. So it's -- she's a very discerning, very quick-moving customer, and we're trying to capture her interest and get her engaged with the SIX:02 brand. It's been a little bit difficult with only 30 doors, so I'm a firm believer that the excitement that's going to be generated out the doors here in the city will certainly give a big momentum push, as will some of the good work that we're going to do with some of our key vendor partners in the SIX:02 space to drive real energy around that banner."

Because none of our banners performed well in the economy with some of the traffic issues that we saw. But from a broader perspective, we're repositioning both Runners Point and Sidestep. And we did some -- you know how we operate. We test things pretty significantly before we go ahead and roll them out. And the tests that we saw back in 2014, where we positioned Runners Point was all things runner -- running and Sidestep more on the lifestyle end of the spectrum, with our Foot Locker banner right in between, the results in 2014 were pretty positive. And they convinced us that we could go ahead with that. In hindsight, what we found is there were a couple of really significant silhouettes that were driving the running side of the business, especially in Germany, right? Each market in Western Europe is different, and Germany was definitely locked on to a couple of key silhouettes that have fallen out of favor a bit. So it really caused -- first, we fired a bunch of customers from Runners Point because we took out the vulcanized shoes, we took out the skate shoes, we took out the boots and we really focused it on the running consumer. And then that running consumer moved off a couple of the key silhouettes that had really been propping up the results. So it's an assortment mix. It's a brand mix. And I think the team in Recklinghausen is addressing it as quickly as they can with the vendor partners. And then the other piece is on the Sidestep side of the house, making sure that we've got the right lifestyle piece of it and a little bit more fashion forward. So we've got work to do there but the team is diligently working on it. We spent a little time over in Germany this summer, and we see some progress. But we do definitely have work to do."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined this morning by Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who in a moment will provide the details of the company's strong third quarter financial performance; and by Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will highlight the strength of our position in the athletic industry and discuss some key recent merchandise trends. 
First, though, let me give a high-level overview of our results. Driven by a comparable-store sales gain of 4.7%, the company generated earnings of $157 million in the third quarter or $1.17 per share. This strong result includes 2 significant accounting events, a tax adjustment and an impairment charge, which together increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Thus, on a non-GAAP basis, Foot Locker's earnings were $1.13 in the quarter, up 13% from our non-GAAP results of $1 a year ago.
While a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the tables attached to this morning's press release, let me very briefly say that the tax expense adjustments resulted from a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided by Foot Locker in the U.S. to our European business. Driven by the recent strong performance of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new higher valuation resulted in increased deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million, adding $0.07 per share to our GAAP earnings.
Going the other direction was an impairment charge primarily related to certain underperforming store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep, which overall continued its negative sales trend. This charge was $6 million on a pretax basis or $0.03 per share after tax, resulting in the net $0.04 differential between our GAAP earnings of $1.17 per share and our non-GAAP result of $1.13. 
The strong third quarter performance, when added to our first half results, brought our year-to-date non-GAAP earnings to $470 million. This equates to EPS of $3.46, 10% over last year's earnings of $3.14 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
With that summary, let me pass the call to Lauren."
315394,408513494,1089414,"Foot Locker, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2016",2016-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Foot Locker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the to",1393,"Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.
As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the top line, where we produced a 4.7% comparable-store sales gain in line with our previous guidance of a mid-single-digit increase. This strong result was on top of last year's robust 8.7% comp gain. In terms of cadence, our comparable sales increased mid-single digits in each month of the quarter. 
Looking at the details. We saw that many of the same trends we have spoken about this year remained unchanged during the third quarter. By category, footwear and apparel were both up mid-single digits while accessories posted a low single-digit decline. Women's footwear was quite strong, posting a double-digit comparable sales gain. Superstar from adi was especially popular with women's and led the increase across virtually all of our geographies and banners where we sell women's products. Our children's footwear business also performed well and was up mid-single digits while our men's footwear sales finished up low single digits.
By category, running and casual footwear were both up in the high single-digit range while basketball was down slightly. Lifestyle running, led by Nike and adi, continued to be very strong while among our casual styles, Stan Smith from adi, Vans Classics and PUMA Suedes and Clydes were top consumer choices. Within basketball, strength in court classic style, such as Superstars, largely offset declines in performance shoes. Average selling prices in footwear were up in the low end of mid-single digits while units were also up low single digits. Unlike a lot of retail, our store traffic in the U.S. was up and our comparable sales in the store segment were up mid-single digits. 
On a percentage basis, the top performer this quarter was SIX:02 with a comp sales increase well into double digits. This exciting performance was driven by footwear with strong gains in PUMA, adi and Nike. Foot Locker Canada continued its strong performance, producing an excellent double-digit increase, driven by strong results in men's, women's and kids. Footwear was up double digits and apparel and accessories were both up high single digits.
Among the male banners in the U.S., the top performance was delivered by Champs Sports, which produced a double-digit comparable sales gain, driven by a mid-teens increase in apparel and a high single-digit gain in footwear. The Foot Locker division in the U.S., which now includes our remaining Lady Foot Locker stores, was up mid-single digits. Previously mentioned, we have found that our Lady Foot Locker customer largely responds to the same influences as the female customers in our Foot Locker stores. Kids Foot Locker, meanwhile, was up in the low end of mid-single digits while Footaction posted a low single-digit gain.
No doubt the most exciting event of the quarter for us was the reopening of our flagship store on 34th Street at the end of August. The grand opening generated tremendous excitement amongst the legions of customers that took part in the launch of the newest, most premium sneaker experience in New York. The space includes not just the pinnacle Foot Locker experience but also contains shops to highlight the best product story of all of our fantastic, innovative vendors. And for me, most exciting of all is the first SIX:02 presence here in New York City, a key step that we believe will build brand awareness for the banner, not just in New York but nationally and even to some extent, internationally. 
Elsewhere among our international divisions, Foot Locker Asia Pacific comped up low single digits. Foot Locker Europe was pressured by declines in traffic, especially in Italy, France and Spain, and produced a low single-digit comp sales decline. Our women's business in Europe stood out with a strong performance in both footwear and apparel. We believe that the current negative traffic trends in Europe will dissipate. Our youthful customers tend to be resilient. And we believe the investments we are making elevate the experience of our European sneaker enthusiasts and build even deeper connections with them will drive future increases in traffic. Our weakest store banner performances were at our Runners Point and Sidestep banners, which continue to face traffic and sales challenges and were down double digits during the quarter.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid overall performance with an 8.9% comp gain. Our collective store banners' dot-com business in the U.S. continued its strong growth with sales up slightly over 20% while our international direct businesses, including the digital operations of the Foot Locker banner in Europe and Canada, were up approximately 50%. Eastbay, on the other hand, declined high single digits. Dick will provide some perspective during his remarks about this result and our ongoing efforts to improve the performance at Eastbay. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.8% of total sales, up from 12.4% a year ago.
Moving to the rest of the income statement. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points to 33.9% of sales. The uptick was driven by merchandise margin, which also improved by 10 basis points. The progress in merchandise margin was the result of lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decrease in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. As we noted on our previous call, Eastbay, which is still our largest digital banner, continued to be more promotional than in the past in response to weakening traffic with its website.
Our team did another very good job managing expenses during the third quarter. Our SG&A expense rate improved by 20 basis points to 19.4% of sales despite increased marketing costs within the direct-to-customer segment, which we mentioned would persist when we provided guidance on last quarter's call. Depreciation expense increased $40 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Consistent with previous quarters, this increase reflects the incremental investments we are making in our store fleet, our digital businesses and technology to continue to drive greater productivity from all of our assets.
On a GAAP basis, our Q3 tax rate came in at 30.9%, the result of the tax benefit in Europe that John mentioned in his opening remarks. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate was 34.9%. We expect to realize a modest ongoing tax rate improvement in future periods from the new intellectual property valuation. This benefit will be included in future guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to manage our inventory effectively and ended the quarter with inventory up 1.9% from a year ago compared to a sales increase of 5.1%. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up 2.2% compared to our 5.5% sales increase.Our inventory remains fresh and exciting. And we are well positioned for the important upcoming holiday season, starting this weekend with this year's edition of the Week of Greatness. It's going to be great, just ask Tom Brady. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $865 million, down $13 million from a year ago. We continued using our balanced approach to capital allocation, including reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. First, capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $193 million and leaving us on track to reach the full year target of approximately $290 million that we mentioned last quarter. Second, we returned $37 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. And finally, we spent $76 million to repurchase 1.15 million shares of common stock. In total, we have returned $463 million to our shareholders through the first 9 months of the year while continuing to make the strategic investments in the business necessary to drive our future growth.
Before I turn the call over to Dick, let me reiterate that for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, slight improvements in both gross margin and SG&A and a double-digit EPS gain. As a result, we are on track to achieve the annual guidance we gave you at the beginning of 2016, a mid-single-digit comparable sales increase and a double-digit gain in EPS.
Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our important leadership role in the industry and highlight a few of the major product trends this quarter."
315394,408513494,1089414,"Foot Locker, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2016",2016-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Foot Locker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lauren. Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, o",2037,"Thanks, Lauren. Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, our strong brands, our extensive global reach, the diversity of the categories in which we operate and ultimately, our outstanding financial performance.
The very first dimension I discussed is actually the most important one, and that is the leadership position we have with the core customers of each of our banners. I want to come back to this aspect because it is a crucial element of our ongoing success story. In the past, we have talked about the casualization of the dressing styles around the world and the ongoing adoption of healthier, more active lifestyles, both of which support steady growth of our athletic footwear and apparel businesses. But our team's work with our customers is much more dynamic and powerful than that. It comes down to this, our brands are at the epicenter of sneaker culture. And we work hard every day to stay there because what drives sneaker culture is changing all the time. 
What is sneaker culture? It means different things to different people. But the heart of it is a true, deep passion for sneakers. And what defines the epicenter of sneaker culture is a bit different for each of our core customers. The forces driving a love for sneakers with our muse at Champs Sports are not exactly the same as the forces motivating our customers at Footaction or Foot Locker. And the Foot Locker customer of New York is different than the one in L.A. or London, Paris, Milan or for that matter, Sydney or Auckland. Sometimes, it's a musician. Sometimes, it's an athlete. And very often, that athlete style off the court or pitch is even more influential than what he or she accomplishes in their sport.
Our female customers have an even broader range of style influences. And not surprisingly, the muse at Lady Foot Locker is very different than the one at SIX:02. That's one of the key reasons we separated the management of these 2 businesses. With the ubiquity of social media, there are, of course, some overarching style themes that each of these sneaker lovers share. But it is our own passion for sneakers and our understanding of these subtle differences that are key to our ability to maintain critical points of differentiation between our banners and from the competition, keeping our interaction with our customers authentic.
Authenticity is a key concept in connecting with the customers, who are affectionately called sneakerheads, those who buy the most sneakers and who set or influence of the athletic footwear and apparel styles for their peers. We strive to be authentic with our customers in the products we showcase and the quality of the physical spaces they shop in and the seamlessness of the digital interaction we have with them and in the knowledge and enthusiasm of our associates as they engage with our customers each and every day.
In terms of physical locations, Lauren mentioned the high-energy flagship store on 34th Street that we reopened in August, which is off to a great start. If there's an epicenter of sneaker culture in New York, it's got to be on 34th Street. This quarter, we will also debut our exciting new combined Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and SIX:02 stores near Times Square. That ground opening is slated for January. 
The best thing about sneakerheads is that they come from all over, in all shapes and sizes, ethnicities, genders and ages. In fact, kids are starting earlier and earlier to develop into sneaker aficionados. We actually have 4-year-old sneakerhead customers. Sometimes, their parents, who also grew up loving sneakers, get them involved. And sometimes, the kids push the parents. But either way, it has been a huge benefit to our leading position in the kids business. 
Although some kids grow out of being sneakerheads as they become teenagers, and then adults. Fortunately, it turns out a lot of them don't. It is a common occurrence for shareholders to tell me they have a teenage son or daughter who is absolutely passionate about sneakers. And on more than one occasion, I've also had the pleasure of talking in depth about our various business strategies with the portfolio manager, where the meeting was wrapping up, has come up to me privately and said, ""Hey, I get it, I've got 30 pairs of sneakers in the closet myself."" I usually tell them that with 30 pairs, they're just getting started. 
As great as our vendors are, and they're all excellent, style preferences of our customers shift between them, which is why being a multi-brand retailer is so important. Our vendors have certainly come to recognize and support the critical position we have built within the industry in terms of providing that feeling of authenticity to our customers. As our tagline says, if it's at Foot Locker, it's approved. We work continuously with our vendors to share the insights we gather during the journey of discovering what our customers find to be the best, coolest sneakers and apparel at any given moment. Ultimately, it is having available the most innovative products from our outstanding suppliers that keeps our banners top of mind with our most influential customers.
There are always competitors who would like to knock us off our spot at the epicenter of sneaker culture. We never take it for granted that we will remain our customers' preferred destination. And we work hard every day to maintain our unparalleled connection with an understanding of the customers of each of our banners. We started a few years ago with the male muse for each of our banners and a female muse for our women's business. We have progressed dramatically since then to identify the core male, female and child customers of each of our banners. And for our kids business, we've even started talking about the parent muses. As I said, it starts with our store associates, who often proudly describe themselves as sneakerheads. And it extends to our marketing teams, our merchants and indeed, everyone in our company. It is vital to our ongoing success at staying at the center of sneaker culture. 
While Lauren mentioned quite a few banner, geographic, channel and category highlights that illustrate how all that excellent work is driving our strong overall performance, she also mentioned a couple of softer parts of our business, which highlights how difficult it is to build and maintain our central position. And the solution to these 2 areas that I'm about to talk about, I firmly believe, are rooted in doing an even better job understanding and engaging with the core customers of these banners. 
First, Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to struggle as seen in the negative comp result and the impairment charge taken this quarter. While part of the challenge is related to German retail in general, I believe the more fundamental issue is that we fired at too many customers when we embarked on our banner segmentation strategy in Germany a couple of years ago. We made some assumptions about who our core customers were in these 2 banners and worked with our vendors to deliver product assortments we believe will be right for them. In retrospect, the team there didn't have the same process and discipline for listening to our customers that we have developed at our other banners. So we have now redoubled our efforts to make those connections.
I can't say yet that we have it solved perfectly going forward. And even to the extent that we have improved our own understanding of what motivates the customers of these banners, we still have the challenge of making sure all of our vendors equally understand and allocate the right products. For example, while a sharp point of differentiation at Runners Point is on the performance running side, we know this banner's customers wear sneakers for a lot of other occasion in their life. And we need to be the destination for those sneaker purchases as well. We remain committed to the Runners Point and Sidestep business and believe we can get their performance back to the previous levels of profitability, which is the starting point for the ultimate goal of expanding those banners outside Germany. 
Turning to Eastbay. A big factor in that banner's recent struggles continues to be the overall shift in style preferences away from performance-oriented products to more athletic lifestyle assortments. That said, this is an area where we let ourselves get knocked off-center a bit in connecting with the lead high school athlete, who's always worn both casual athletic and performance footwear and apparel. But we are still strongly positioned with him and her. We have recently hired a new leader for our digital business. Vijay Talwar, who brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and energy to the challenge of again making Eastbay the first choice for that important customer. 
Before we get to your questions, I'd like to just touch on a few product highlights. First of all, one of the most significant dynamics in our industry right now is the continued growth of adidas across multiple platforms. On the lifestyle side, adi Originals, such as Nomad and Superstars, are continuing to be on trend while the performance styles of PureBOOST and Ultra Boost are growing in importance in all of our geographies.
Nike certainly remains our largest vendor by far overall and largest in each of our banners. Lifestyle running continued to be a tremendous strength for Nike with significant sales of Roshe, Huarache, Presto and Max Air across all our markets. The Jordan Brand continues to build popularity around the world. And there was also strength in Foamposites and seasonal boots from Nike. While signature basketball overall remained soft, Nike's Kyrie Irving shoes sold quite well as did the Curry 2.0 and 2.5 product from Under Armour. 
Another strongly uptrending brand in the quarter was PUMA. PUMA Creepers, platforms and Suedes delivered excellent performance for us in almost all of our banners, especially in our women's businesses. While limited to certain banners and geographies, we're also seeing encouraging momentum in other brands, such as Vans, Reebok, ASICs and New Balance. Our boot business, led by Timberland, is still quite important, although it has gotten off to a somewhat slower start this year compared to last year. 
In apparel, I'm very pleased with the mid-single-digit sales increase that Lauren mentioned. We are making progress in our apparel businesses in most of our banners. Overall, apparel profitability is up to the point where margins are close to catching up to the already strong footwear margins. ASPs in apparel were up double digits, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on a more premium assortment. Apparel units, as expected, were down. The windwear category, led by products, such as the Nike Windrunner, continues to be the hottest trend right now. Our overall T-shirt business performed very well, propelled by our own Team Edition group as did CSG fleece and nylon jackets at Champs Sports. 
I'd like to close my remarks by saying how proud I am of the entire team at Foot Locker, Inc. This was our 27th consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and non-GAAP profit growth. And Lauren outlined our belief that we can obtain yet another record performance in Q4. We have diligently executed our strategic initiatives over several years and built a high performing business, not just from a macro level, but also from the ground-up. 
As a business, we strive for consistent, authentic and memorable interactions with each customer who comes into our stores or visits our websites. Between our 3,400 stores and our numerous websites, such interactions happened literally millions of times every day, and it is a preparation, skill and passion that each and everyone of our associates that creates the authenticity of these interactions in which motivates our customers to position us at the epicenter of sneaker culture, right where we want to be. Emma, let's open the call for question, please."

It may become from the jean style that they choose to wear. But we continue to see strength in the key brands that I called out certainly. Adidas is on a great run. They're having some -- a lot of success. But we, at the same time, have tremendous successes across the Nike brand. The one place of that you called out to me low signature basketball is a place that's a little bit softer. With That being said, we saw some good pop on the KD 9 that came out, the Kyrie Irving shoe continues to be exceptionally well. The Under Armour Curry product, the 2.0 and 2.5 during the quarter did very well. So it's a combination. And certainly, we see product that we believe is going to excite the customer. Some of it is in signature basketball, some of it is in lifestyle running. But I've talked the last couple of calls that our team does such a tremendous job of moving open-to-buy dollars from vendors in categories and don't really think in terms of categories as much as maybe the analyst community does. We think in terms of what's going to motivate the kids to buy, and we create our in-store and online and digital environments to appeal to that.

This young consumer is really obsessed with sneaker culture and they will be back as we head into the holiday season. Our team is certainly ready and prepared and the product assortments will drive them back. There's great marketing that's going on. The team over in Europe is doing a fantastic job. Lauren referred to our Week of Greatness, and this year's campaign, I think, is by far the best that we've done. But it also is the most international that we've done.

The connectivity with the consumer, I think the Foot Locker Europe team has a deep connectivity and understanding and engagement with their consumer base. And that varies country to country, obviously. The North of Europe and the South of Europe has very different buying patterns and buying characteristics and product desires. The Sidestep and Runners Point business have, relatively speaking, no apparel. There's a little bit of performance running apparel in Runners Point stores. But part of the strength of Foot Locker Europe is a really, really good footwear business in general and a much improved apparel business over the last 6 or 7 quarters. So those are probably the biggest thing is that Runners Point and Sidestep don't have the ability to diversify from a geography point of view or a family of business point of view. So the way that's all in sneakers, In Runners Point, it's all on running silhouette of sneakers. And Sidestep has got no apparel mix at all. So those will probably be the biggest differences, Omar."

But I think what we learned, probably the biggest learning, we started out very much performance led with fashion being the second feature of the assortment, certainly, from an apparel point of view. And the big shift that's happened, Matt, is that we now look from a lifestyle/fashion perspective first and know that the function of the performance aspects have to be built into a lot of the assortment because she wants to look great, but she expects it to perform. So some of the Rihanna product that we launched with PUMA right as we opened the store in late August, beginning in September, people look at it and say, ""Well, it's very fashion forward for a Foot Locker banner."" And they're right, it is. But that's sort of the attraction that our muse in that better and the SIX:02 better has. So the shift has been from performance led to lifestyle led with performance attributes. That's both on a, mostly on an apparel point of view, but also on a footwear point of view, right? Some of the creepers and things that we mentioned in our prepared remarks obviously resonated really well with the SIX:02 consumer. And the energy that we see in the SIX:02 store on 34th Street here is helping us understand what that in-store experience for the consumer should be like. And we'll be able to take those learnings and take it across the other 30 stores from the fleet. And as I mentioned earlier, it'll be ready to expand a bit in the U.S. later in 2017. Once we get it right there, then we can come back to your question about a global impact, Matt."

And as significant partners with our suppliers, I think we end up with, I don't know if our fair share is the right way to put it, but we end up with a model that the consumers are driven by because they know they have to get into the stores and they get it or they might not have the chance. So the scarcity piece of the allocation model is important to our success as well."

And our consumer is motivated by cool, by sneaker culture. They're not motivated. It's not a basketball culture, it's sneaker culture that drives us. And sneaker culture crosses all of the brands and all of the categories. I mentioned some of the brands that we're seeing specific geographic success with, right? They have a window of opportunity maybe along the I-95 corridor. It may be a California-based things. But we have a lot of store density in those 2 areas. So some of these brands that I mentioned, ASICs, Vans, they've got huge opportunities in a segment of our stores. And the consumer really -- we like to say the consumer votes with their feet at the end of the day. They go out and they find what the coolest shoe is. So I like -- we've always been a multi-branded store. And I think the work on 34th Street to really showcase those brands, the work in all of our remodels to showcase brands brings the brand strength together and allows us to tell powerful stories around the great products that our manufacturing partners deliver to us. So the multibranded strategy, the strength of those brands is, again, an important part of our success."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined this morning by Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who in a moment will provide the details of the company's strong third quarter financial performance; and by Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will highlight the strength of our position in the athletic industry and discuss some key recent merchandise trends. 
First, though, let me give a high-level overview of our results. Driven by a comparable-store sales gain of 4.7%, the company generated earnings of $157 million in the third quarter or $1.17 per share. This strong result includes 2 significant accounting events, a tax adjustment and an impairment charge, which together increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Thus, on a non-GAAP basis, Foot Locker's earnings were $1.13 in the quarter, up 13% from our non-GAAP results of $1 a year ago.
While a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the tables attached to this morning's press release, let me very briefly say that the tax expense adjustments resulted from a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided by Foot Locker in the U.S. to our European business. Driven by the recent strong performance of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new higher valuation resulted in increased deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million, adding $0.07 per share to our GAAP earnings.
Going the other direction was an impairment charge primarily related to certain underperforming store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep, which overall continued its negative sales trend. This charge was $6 million on a pretax basis or $0.03 per share after tax, resulting in the net $0.04 differential between our GAAP earnings of $1.17 per share and our non-GAAP result of $1.13. 
The strong third quarter performance, when added to our first half results, brought our year-to-date non-GAAP earnings to $470 million. This equates to EPS of $3.46, 10% over last year's earnings of $3.14 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
With that summary, let me pass the call to Lauren."

We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the to",1393,"Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.
As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the top line, where we produced a 4.7% comparable-store sales gain in line with our previous guidance of a mid-single-digit increase. This strong result was on top of last year's robust 8.7% comp gain. In terms of cadence, our comparable sales increased mid-single digits in each month of the quarter. 
Looking at the details. We saw that many of the same trends we have spoken about this year remained unchanged during the third quarter. By category, footwear and apparel were both up mid-single digits while accessories posted a low single-digit decline. Women's footwear was quite strong, posting a double-digit comparable sales gain. Superstar from adi was especially popular with women's and led the increase across virtually all of our geographies and banners where we sell women's products. Our children's footwear business also performed well and was up mid-single digits while our men's footwear sales finished up low single digits.
By category, running and casual footwear were both up in the high single-digit range while basketball was down slightly. Lifestyle running, led by Nike and adi, continued to be very strong while among our casual styles, Stan Smith from adi, Vans Classics and PUMA Suedes and Clydes were top consumer choices. Within basketball, strength in court classic style, such as Superstars, largely offset declines in performance shoes. Average selling prices in footwear were up in the low end of mid-single digits while units were also up low single digits. Unlike a lot of retail, our store traffic in the U.S. was up and our comparable sales in the store segment were up mid-single digits. 
On a percentage basis, the top performer this quarter was SIX:02 with a comp sales increase well into double digits. This exciting performance was driven by footwear with strong gains in PUMA, adi and Nike. Foot Locker Canada continued its strong performance, producing an excellent double-digit increase, driven by strong results in men's, women's and kids. Footwear was up double digits and apparel and accessories were both up high single digits.
Among the male banners in the U.S., the top performance was delivered by Champs Sports, which produced a double-digit comparable sales gain, driven by a mid-teens increase in apparel and a high single-digit gain in footwear. The Foot Locker division in the U.S., which now includes our remaining Lady Foot Locker stores, was up mid-single digits. Previously mentioned, we have found that our Lady Foot Locker customer largely responds to the same influences as the female customers in our Foot Locker stores. Kids Foot Locker, meanwhile, was up in the low end of mid-single digits while Footaction posted a low single-digit gain.
No doubt the most exciting event of the quarter for us was the reopening of our flagship store on 34th Street at the end of August. The grand opening generated tremendous excitement amongst the legions of customers that took part in the launch of the newest, most premium sneaker experience in New York. The space includes not just the pinnacle Foot Locker experience but also contains shops to highlight the best product story of all of our fantastic, innovative vendors. And for me, most exciting of all is the first SIX:02 presence here in New York City, a key step that we believe will build brand awareness for the banner, not just in New York but nationally and even to some extent, internationally. 
Elsewhere among our international divisions, Foot Locker Asia Pacific comped up low single digits. Foot Locker Europe was pressured by declines in traffic, especially in Italy, France and Spain, and produced a low single-digit comp sales decline. Our women's business in Europe stood out with a strong performance in both footwear and apparel. We believe that the current negative traffic trends in Europe will dissipate. Our youthful customers tend to be resilient. And we believe the investments we are making elevate the experience of our European sneaker enthusiasts and build even deeper connections with them will drive future increases in traffic. Our weakest store banner performances were at our Runners Point and Sidestep banners, which continue to face traffic and sales challenges and were down double digits during the quarter.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid overall performance with an 8.9% comp gain. Our collective store banners' dot-com business in the U.S. continued its strong growth with sales up slightly over 20% while our international direct businesses, including the digital operations of the Foot Locker banner in Europe and Canada, were up approximately 50%. Eastbay, on the other hand, declined high single digits. Dick will provide some perspective during his remarks about this result and our ongoing efforts to improve the performance at Eastbay. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.8% of total sales, up from 12.4% a year ago.
Moving to the rest of the income statement. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points to 33.9% of sales. The uptick was driven by merchandise margin, which also improved by 10 basis points. The progress in merchandise margin was the result of lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decrease in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. As we noted on our previous call, Eastbay, which is still our largest digital banner, continued to be more promotional than in the past in response to weakening traffic with its website.
Our team did another very good job managing expenses during the third quarter. Our SG&A expense rate improved by 20 basis points to 19.4% of sales despite increased marketing costs within the direct-to-customer segment, which we mentioned would persist when we provided guidance on last quarter's call. Depreciation expense increased $40 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Consistent with previous quarters, this increase reflects the incremental investments we are making in our store fleet, our digital businesses and technology to continue to drive greater productivity from all of our assets.
On a GAAP basis, our Q3 tax rate came in at 30.9%, the result of the tax benefit in Europe that John mentioned in his opening remarks. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate was 34.9%. We expect to realize a modest ongoing tax rate improvement in future periods from the new intellectual property valuation. This benefit will be included in future guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to manage our inventory effectively and ended the quarter with inventory up 1.9% from a year ago compared to a sales increase of 5.1%. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up 2.2% compared to our 5.5% sales increase.Our inventory remains fresh and exciting. And we are well positioned for the important upcoming holiday season, starting this weekend with this year's edition of the Week of Greatness. It's going to be great, just ask Tom Brady. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $865 million, down $13 million from a year ago. We continued using our balanced approach to capital allocation, including reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. First, capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $193 million and leaving us on track to reach the full year target of approximately $290 million that we mentioned last quarter. Second, we returned $37 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. And finally, we spent $76 million to repurchase 1.15 million shares of common stock. In total, we have returned $463 million to our shareholders through the first 9 months of the year while continuing to make the strategic investments in the business necessary to drive our future growth.
Before I turn the call over to Dick, let me reiterate that for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, slight improvements in both gross margin and SG&A and a double-digit EPS gain. As a result, we are on track to achieve the annual guidance we gave you at the beginning of 2016, a mid-single-digit comparable sales increase and a double-digit gain in EPS.
Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our important leadership role in the industry and highlight a few of the major product trends this quarter."

Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, o",2037,"Thanks, Lauren. Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, our strong brands, our extensive global reach, the diversity of the categories in which we operate and ultimately, our outstanding financial performance.
The very first dimension I discussed is actually the most important one, and that is the leadership position we have with the core customers of each of our banners. I want to come back to this aspect because it is a crucial element of our ongoing success story. In the past, we have talked about the casualization of the dressing styles around the world and the ongoing adoption of healthier, more active lifestyles, both of which support steady growth of our athletic footwear and apparel businesses. But our team's work with our customers is much more dynamic and powerful than that. It comes down to this, our brands are at the epicenter of sneaker culture. And we work hard every day to stay there because what drives sneaker culture is changing all the time. 
What is sneaker culture? It means different things to different people. But the heart of it is a true, deep passion for sneakers. And what defines the epicenter of sneaker culture is a bit different for each of our core customers. The forces driving a love for sneakers with our muse at Champs Sports are not exactly the same as the forces motivating our customers at Footaction or Foot Locker. And the Foot Locker customer of New York is different than the one in L.A. or London, Paris, Milan or for that matter, Sydney or Auckland. Sometimes, it's a musician. Sometimes, it's an athlete. And very often, that athlete style off the court or pitch is even more influential than what he or she accomplishes in their sport.
Our female customers have an even broader range of style influences. And not surprisingly, the muse at Lady Foot Locker is very different than the one at SIX:02. That's one of the key reasons we separated the management of these 2 businesses. With the ubiquity of social media, there are, of course, some overarching style themes that each of these sneaker lovers share. But it is our own passion for sneakers and our understanding of these subtle differences that are key to our ability to maintain critical points of differentiation between our banners and from the competition, keeping our interaction with our customers authentic.
Authenticity is a key concept in connecting with the customers, who are affectionately called sneakerheads, those who buy the most sneakers and who set or influence of the athletic footwear and apparel styles for their peers. We strive to be authentic with our customers in the products we showcase and the quality of the physical spaces they shop in and the seamlessness of the digital interaction we have with them and in the knowledge and enthusiasm of our associates as they engage with our customers each and every day.
In terms of physical locations, Lauren mentioned the high-energy flagship store on 34th Street that we reopened in August, which is off to a great start. If there's an epicenter of sneaker culture in New York, it's got to be on 34th Street. This quarter, we will also debut our exciting new combined Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and SIX:02 stores near Times Square. That ground opening is slated for January. 
The best thing about sneakerheads is that they come from all over, in all shapes and sizes, ethnicities, genders and ages. In fact, kids are starting earlier and earlier to develop into sneaker aficionados. We actually have 4-year-old sneakerhead customers. Sometimes, their parents, who also grew up loving sneakers, get them involved. And sometimes, the kids push the parents. But either way, it has been a huge benefit to our leading position in the kids business. 
Although some kids grow out of being sneakerheads as they become teenagers, and then adults. Fortunately, it turns out a lot of them don't. It is a common occurrence for shareholders to tell me they have a teenage son or daughter who is absolutely passionate about sneakers. And on more than one occasion, I've also had the pleasure of talking in depth about our various business strategies with the portfolio manager, where the meeting was wrapping up, has come up to me privately and said, ""Hey, I get it, I've got 30 pairs of sneakers in the closet myself."" I usually tell them that with 30 pairs, they're just getting started. 
As great as our vendors are, and they're all excellent, style preferences of our customers shift between them, which is why being a multi-brand retailer is so important. Our vendors have certainly come to recognize and support the critical position we have built within the industry in terms of providing that feeling of authenticity to our customers. As our tagline says, if it's at Foot Locker, it's approved. We work continuously with our vendors to share the insights we gather during the journey of discovering what our customers find to be the best, coolest sneakers and apparel at any given moment. Ultimately, it is having available the most innovative products from our outstanding suppliers that keeps our banners top of mind with our most influential customers.
There are always competitors who would like to knock us off our spot at the epicenter of sneaker culture. We never take it for granted that we will remain our customers' preferred destination. And we work hard every day to maintain our unparalleled connection with an understanding of the customers of each of our banners. We started a few years ago with the male muse for each of our banners and a female muse for our women's business. We have progressed dramatically since then to identify the core male, female and child customers of each of our banners. And for our kids business, we've even started talking about the parent muses. As I said, it starts with our store associates, who often proudly describe themselves as sneakerheads. And it extends to our marketing teams, our merchants and indeed, everyone in our company. It is vital to our ongoing success at staying at the center of sneaker culture. 
While Lauren mentioned quite a few banner, geographic, channel and category highlights that illustrate how all that excellent work is driving our strong overall performance, she also mentioned a couple of softer parts of our business, which highlights how difficult it is to build and maintain our central position. And the solution to these 2 areas that I'm about to talk about, I firmly believe, are rooted in doing an even better job understanding and engaging with the core customers of these banners. 
First, Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to struggle as seen in the negative comp result and the impairment charge taken this quarter. While part of the challenge is related to German retail in general, I believe the more fundamental issue is that we fired at too many customers when we embarked on our banner segmentation strategy in Germany a couple of years ago. We made some assumptions about who our core customers were in these 2 banners and worked with our vendors to deliver product assortments we believe will be right for them. In retrospect, the team there didn't have the same process and discipline for listening to our customers that we have developed at our other banners. So we have now redoubled our efforts to make those connections.
I can't say yet that we have it solved perfectly going forward. And even to the extent that we have improved our own understanding of what motivates the customers of these banners, we still have the challenge of making sure all of our vendors equally understand and allocate the right products. For example, while a sharp point of differentiation at Runners Point is on the performance running side, we know this banner's customers wear sneakers for a lot of other occasion in their life. And we need to be the destination for those sneaker purchases as well. We remain committed to the Runners Point and Sidestep business and believe we can get their performance back to the previous levels of profitability, which is the starting point for the ultimate goal of expanding those banners outside Germany. 
Turning to Eastbay. A big factor in that banner's recent struggles continues to be the overall shift in style preferences away from performance-oriented products to more athletic lifestyle assortments. That said, this is an area where we let ourselves get knocked off-center a bit in connecting with the lead high school athlete, who's always worn both casual athletic and performance footwear and apparel. But we are still strongly positioned with him and her. We have recently hired a new leader for our digital business. Vijay Talwar, who brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and energy to the challenge of again making Eastbay the first choice for that important customer. 
Before we get to your questions, I'd like to just touch on a few product highlights. First of all, one of the most significant dynamics in our industry right now is the continued growth of adidas across multiple platforms. On the lifestyle side, adi Originals, such as Nomad and Superstars, are continuing to be on trend while the performance styles of PureBOOST and Ultra Boost are growing in importance in all of our geographies.
Nike certainly remains our largest vendor by far overall and largest in each of our banners. Lifestyle running continued to be a tremendous strength for Nike with significant sales of Roshe, Huarache, Presto and Max Air across all our markets. The Jordan Brand continues to build popularity around the world. And there was also strength in Foamposites and seasonal boots from Nike. While signature basketball overall remained soft, Nike's Kyrie Irving shoes sold quite well as did the Curry 2.0 and 2.5 product from Under Armour. 
Another strongly uptrending brand in the quarter was PUMA. PUMA Creepers, platforms and Suedes delivered excellent performance for us in almost all of our banners, especially in our women's businesses. While limited to certain banners and geographies, we're also seeing encouraging momentum in other brands, such as Vans, Reebok, ASICs and New Balance. Our boot business, led by Timberland, is still quite important, although it has gotten off to a somewhat slower start this year compared to last year. 
In apparel, I'm very pleased with the mid-single-digit sales increase that Lauren mentioned. We are making progress in our apparel businesses in most of our banners. Overall, apparel profitability is up to the point where margins are close to catching up to the already strong footwear margins. ASPs in apparel were up double digits, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on a more premium assortment. Apparel units, as expected, were down. The windwear category, led by products, such as the Nike Windrunner, continues to be the hottest trend right now. Our overall T-shirt business performed very well, propelled by our own Team Edition group as did CSG fleece and nylon jackets at Champs Sports. 
I'd like to close my remarks by saying how proud I am of the entire team at Foot Locker, Inc. This was our 27th consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and non-GAAP profit growth. And Lauren outlined our belief that we can attain yet another record performance in Q4. We have diligently executed our strategic initiatives over several years and built a high-performing business, not just from a macro level but also from the ground-up. As a business, we strive for consistent, authentic and memorable interactions with each customer who comes into our stores or visits our websites. Between our 3,400 stores and our numerous websites, such interactions happen literally millions of times every day. And it is the preparation, skill and passion of each and every one of our associates that creates the authenticity of these interactions and which motivates our customers to position us at the epicenter of sneaker culture, right where we want to be.

We have great brand partners across all of our geographies and all of our banners. So our consumer, while brand is important to the consumer, cool is more important to the consumer. So they move to where they find the coolest sneaker that appeals to them. That appeal may come from social media. It may come from the group of people they hang out with. It may become from the jeans style that they choose to wear. But we continue to see strength in the key brands that I called out certainly. adidas is on a great run. They're having some -- a lot of success. But we, at the same time, have tremendous successes across the Nike brand. The one place of that you called out to me, signature basketball, is a place that's a little bit softer. With that being said, we saw some good pop on the KD 9 that came out. The Kyrie Irving shoe continues to perform exceptionally well. The Under Armour Curry product, the 2.0 and 2.5 during the quarter, did very well. So it's a combination. And certainly, we see product that we believe is going to excite the customer. Some of it is in signature basketball, some of it is in lifestyle running. But I've talked the last couple of calls that our team does such a tremendous job of moving open-to-buy dollars from vendors in categories. And we don't really think in terms of categories as much as maybe the analyst community does. We think in terms of what's going to motivate the kid to buy. And we create our in-store and online and digital environments to appeal to that. So yes, we see good products coming. And some of them are certainly in performance signature basketball.

So there's ups and downs across the countries, but they've got a much broader base. Runners Point and Sidestep are, for the greatest part, domiciled within the borders of Germany. So if there's traffic issues in Germany, Runners Point and Sidestep don't have any other place they can be lifted from. The connectivity with the consumer, I think the Foot Locker Europe team has a deep connectivity and understanding and engagement with their consumer base. And that varies country-to-country, obviously. The North of Europe and the South of Europe has very different buying patterns and buying characteristics and product desires. The Sidestep and Runners Point business have, relatively speaking, no apparel. I mean, there's a little bit of performance running apparel in Runners Point stores. But part of the strength of Foot Locker Europe is a really, really good footwear business in general and a much improved apparel business over the last 6 or 7 quarters. So those are -- probably the biggest thing is that Runners Point and Sidestep don't have the ability to diversify from a geography point of view or a family of business point of view. So the weight is all on sneakers. In Runners Point, it's all on running silhouettes of sneakers. And Sidestep has got no apparel mix at all. So those would probably be the biggest differences, Omar."

But I think what we learned -- probably the biggest learning, we started out very much performance-led with fashion being the second feature of the assortment certainly from an apparel point of view. And the big shift that's happened, Matt, is that we now look from a lifestyle/fashion perspective first and know that the function of the performance aspects have to be built into a lot of the assortment because she wants to look great, but she expects it to perform. So some of the Rihanna product that we launched with PUMA right as we opened the store in late August, beginning of September, people look at it and say, ""Well, that's very fashion-forward for a Foot Locker banner."" And they're right, it is. But that's sort of the attraction that our muse in that banner and the SIX:02 banner has. So the shift has been from performance-led to lifestyle-led with performance attributes. That's both on a -- mostly on an apparel point of view but also on a footwear point of view, right? Some of the Creepers and things that we mentioned in our prepared remarks obviously resonated really well with the SIX:02 consumer. And the energy that we see in the SIX:02 store on 34th Street here is helping us understand what that in-store experience for the consumer should be like. And we'll be able to take those learnings and take it across the other 30 stores in the fleet, and as I mentioned earlier, be ready to expand a bit in the U.S. later in 2017. Once we get it right there, then we can come back to your question about a global impact, Matt."

So that is a very important priority to us. And our board looks with us at what we're doing with the dividend and share repurchase on a quarterly basis to make sure that we are competitive there and making the right decisions with those capital dollars. So there are a lot of dynamics. And one of them you rightly point out, as you know, where the cash is located.

And our consumer is motivated by cool, by sneaker culture. They're not motivated -- it's not a basketball culture, it's sneaker culture that drives us. And sneaker culture crosses all of the brands and all of the categories. I had mentioned some of the brands that we're seeing specific geographic success with, right? They have a window of opportunity maybe along the I-95 corridor, it may be a California-based thing. But we have a lot of store density in those 2 areas. So some of these brands that I mentioned, ASICS, Vans, they've got huge opportunities in a segment of our stores. And the consumer really -- we like to say the consumer votes with their feet at the end of the day, right? They'd go out and they find what the coolest shoe is. So I like -- we've always been a multi-branded store. And I think the work on 34th Street to really showcase those brands, the work in all of our remodels to showcase brands brings the brand strength together and allows us to tell powerful stories around the great products that our manufacturing partners deliver to us. So the multi-branded strategy, the strength of those brands is again an important part of our success."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined this morning by Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who in a moment will provide the details of the company's strong third quarter financial performance; and by Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will highlight the strength of our position in the athletic industry and discuss some key recent merchandise trends. 
First, though, let me give a high-level overview of our results. Driven by a comparable-store sales gain of 4.7%, the company generated earnings of $157 million in the third quarter or $1.17 per share. This strong result includes 2 significant accounting events, a tax adjustment and an impairment charge, which together increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Thus, on a non-GAAP basis, Foot Locker's earnings were $1.13 in the quarter, up 13% from our non-GAAP results of $1 a year ago.
While a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the tables attached to this morning's press release, let me very briefly say that the tax expense adjustments resulted from a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided by Foot Locker in the U.S. to our European business. Driven by the recent strong performance of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new higher valuation resulted in increased deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million, adding $0.07 per share to our GAAP earnings.
Going the other direction was an impairment charge primarily related to certain underperforming store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep, which overall continued its negative sales trend. This charge was $6 million on a pretax basis or $0.03 per share after tax, resulting in the net $0.04 differential between our GAAP earnings of $1.17 per share and our non-GAAP result of $1.13. 
The strong third quarter performance, when added to our first half results, brought our year-to-date non-GAAP earnings to $470 million. This equates to EPS of $3.46, 10% over last year's earnings of $3.14 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
With that summary, let me pass the call to Lauren."

And it all starts with the to",1394,"Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.
As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the top line, where we produced a 4.7% comparable-store sales gain in line with our previous guidance of a mid-single-digit increase. This strong result was on top of last year's robust 8.7% comp gain. In terms of cadence, our comparable sales increased mid-single digits in each month of the quarter. 
Looking at the details. We saw that many of the same trends we have spoken about this year remained unchanged during the third quarter. By category, footwear and apparel were both up mid-single digits while accessories posted a low single-digit decline. Women's footwear was quite strong, posting a double-digit comparable sales gain. Superstar from adi was especially popular with women's and led the increase across virtually all of our geographies and banners where we sell women's products. Our children's footwear business also performed well and was up mid-single digits while our men's footwear sales finished up low single digits.
By category, running and casual footwear were both up in the high single-digit range while basketball was down slightly. Lifestyle running, led by Nike and adi, continued to be very strong while among our casual styles, Stan Smith from adi, Vans Classics and PUMA Suedes and Clydes were top consumer choices. Within basketball, strength in court classic style, such as Superstars, largely offset declines in performance shoes. Average selling prices in footwear were up in the low end of mid-single digits while units were also up low single digits. Unlike a lot of retail, our store traffic in the U.S. was up and our comparable sales in the store segment were up mid-single digits. 
On a percentage basis, the top performer this quarter was SIX:02 with a comp sales increase well into double digits. This exciting performance was driven by footwear with strong gains in PUMA, adi and Nike. Foot Locker Canada continued its strong performance, producing an excellent double-digit increase, driven by strong results in men's, women's and kids. Footwear was up double digits and apparel and accessories were both up high single digits.
Among the male banners in the U.S., the top performance was delivered by Champs Sports, which produced a double-digit comparable sales gain, driven by a mid-teens increase in apparel and a high single-digit gain in footwear. The Foot Locker division in the U.S., which now includes our remaining Lady Foot Locker stores, was up mid-single digits. Previously mentioned, we have found that our Lady Foot Locker customer largely responds to the same influences as the female customers in our Foot Locker stores. Kids Foot Locker, meanwhile, was up in the low end of mid-single digits while Footaction posted a low single-digit gain.
No doubt the most exciting event of the quarter for us was the reopening of our flagship store on 34th Street at the end of August. The grand opening generated tremendous excitement amongst the legions of customers that took part in the launch of the newest, most premium sneaker experience in New York. The space includes not just the pinnacle Foot Locker experience but also contains shops to highlight the best product story of all of our fantastic, innovative vendors. And for me, most exciting of all is the first SIX:02 presence here in New York City, a key step that we believe will build brand awareness for the banner, not just in New York but nationally and even to some extent, internationally. 
Elsewhere among our international divisions, Foot Locker Asia Pacific comped up low single digits. Foot Locker Europe was pressured by declines in traffic, especially in Italy, France and Spain, and produced a low single-digit comp sales decline. Our women's business in Europe stood out with a strong performance in both footwear and apparel. We believe that the current negative traffic trends in Europe will dissipate. Our youthful customers tend to be resilient. And we believe the investments we are making elevate the experience of our European sneaker enthusiasts and build even deeper connections with them will drive future increases in traffic. Our weakest store banner performances were at our Runners Point and Sidestep banners, which continue to face traffic and sales challenges and were down double digits during the quarter.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid overall performance with an 8.9% comp gain. Our collective store banners' dot-com business in the U.S. continued its strong growth with sales up slightly over 20% while our international direct businesses, including the digital operations of the Foot Locker banner in Europe and Canada, were up approximately 50%. Eastbay, on the other hand, declined high single digits. Dick will provide some perspective during his remarks about this result and our ongoing efforts to improve the performance at Eastbay. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.8% of total sales, up from 12.4% a year ago.
Moving to the rest of the income statement. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points to 33.9% of sales. The uptick was driven by merchandise margin, which also improved by 10 basis points. The progress in merchandise margin was the result of lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decrease in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. As we noted on our previous call, Eastbay, which is still our largest digital banner, continued to be more promotional than in the past in response to weakening traffic with its website.
Our team did another very good job managing expenses during the third quarter. Our SG&A expense rate improved by 20 basis points to 19.4% of sales despite increased marketing costs within the direct-to-customer segment, which we mentioned would persist when we provided guidance on last quarter's call. Depreciation expense increased $40 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Consistent with previous quarters, this increase reflects the incremental investments we are making in our store fleet, our digital businesses and technology to continue to drive greater productivity from all of our assets.
On a GAAP basis, our Q3 tax rate came in at 30.9%, the result of the tax benefit in Europe that John mentioned in his opening remarks. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate was 34.9%. We expect to realize a modest ongoing tax rate improvement in future periods from the new intellectual property valuation. This benefit will be included in future guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to manage our inventory effectively and ended the quarter with inventory up 1.9% from a year ago compared to a sales increase of 5.1%. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up 2.2% compared to our 5.5% sales increase. Our inventory remains fresh and exciting. And we are well positioned for the important upcoming holiday season, starting this weekend with this year's edition of the Week of Greatness. It's going to be great, just ask Tom Brady. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $865 million, down $13 million from a year ago. We continued using our balanced approach to capital allocation, including reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. First, capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $193 million and leaving us on track to reach the full year target of approximately $290 million that we mentioned last quarter. Second, we returned $37 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. And finally, we spent $76 million to repurchase 1.15 million shares of common stock. In total, we have returned $463 million to our shareholders through the first 9 months of the year while continuing to make the strategic investments in the business necessary to drive our future growth.
Before I turn the call over to Dick, let me reiterate that for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, slight improvements in both gross margin and SG&A and a double-digit EPS gain. As a result, we are on track to achieve the annual guidance we gave you at the beginning of 2016, a mid-single-digit comparable sales increase and a double-digit gain in EPS.
Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our important leadership role in the industry and highlight a few of the major product trends this quarter."

Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, o",2036,"Thanks, Lauren. Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, our strong brands, our extensive global reach, the diversity of the categories in which we operate and ultimately, our outstanding financial performance.
The very first dimension I discussed is actually the most important one, and that is the leadership position we have with the core customers of each of our banners. I want to come back to this aspect because it is a crucial element of our ongoing success story. In the past, we have talked about the casualization of the dressing styles around the world and the ongoing adoption of healthier, more active lifestyles, both of which support steady growth of our athletic footwear and apparel businesses. But our team's work with our customers is much more dynamic and powerful than that. It comes down to this, our brands are at the epicenter of sneaker culture. And we work hard every day to stay there because what drives sneaker culture is changing all the time. 
What is sneaker culture? It means different things to different people. But the heart of it is a true, deep passion for sneakers. And what defines the epicenter of sneaker culture is a bit different for each of our core customers. The forces driving a love for sneakers with our muse at Champs Sports are not exactly the same as the forces motivating our customers at Footaction or Foot Locker. And the Foot Locker customer of New York is different than the one in L.A. or London, Paris, Milan or for that matter, Sydney or Auckland. Sometimes, it's a musician. Sometimes, it's an athlete. And very often, that athlete style off the court or pitch is even more influential than what he or she accomplishes in their sport.
Our female customers have an even broader range of style influences. And not surprisingly, the muse at Lady Foot Locker is very different than the one at SIX:02. That's one of the key reasons we separated the management of these 2 businesses. With the ubiquity of social media, there are, of course, some overarching style themes that each of these sneaker lovers share. But it is our own passion for sneakers and our understanding of these subtle differences that are key to our ability to maintain critical points of differentiation between our banners and from the competition, keeping our interaction with our customers authentic.
Authenticity is a key concept in connecting with the customers, who are affectionately called sneakerheads, those who buy the most sneakers and who set or influence of the athletic footwear and apparel styles for their peers. We strive to be authentic with our customers in the products we showcase and the quality of the physical spaces they shop in and the seamlessness of the digital interaction we have with them and in the knowledge and enthusiasm of our associates as they engage with our customers each and every day.
In terms of physical locations, Lauren mentioned the high-energy flagship store on 34th Street that we reopened in August, which is off to a great start. If there's an epicenter of sneaker culture in New York, it's got to be on 34th Street. This quarter, we will also debut our exciting new combined Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and SIX:02 stores near Times Square. That grand opening is slated for January. 
The best thing about sneakerheads is that they come from all over, in all shapes and sizes, ethnicities, genders and ages. In fact, kids are starting earlier and earlier to develop into sneaker aficionados. We actually have 4-year-old sneakerhead customers. Sometimes, their parents, who also grew up loving sneakers, get them involved. And sometimes, the kids push the parents. But either way, it has been a huge benefit to our leading position in the kids business. 
Although some kids grow out of being sneakerheads as they become teenagers, and then adults. Fortunately, it turns out a lot of them don't. It is a common occurrence for shareholders to tell me they have a teenage son or daughter who is absolutely passionate about sneakers. And on more than one occasion, I've also had the pleasure of talking in depth about our various business strategies with the portfolio manager, where the meeting was wrapping up, has come up to me privately and said, ""Hey, I get it, I've got 30 pairs of sneakers in the closet myself."" I usually tell them that with 30 pairs, they're just getting started. 
As great as our vendors are, and they're all excellent, style preferences of our customers shift between them, which is why being a multi-brand retailer is so important. Our vendors have certainly come to recognize and support the critical position we have built within the industry in terms of providing that feeling of authenticity to our customers. As our tagline says, if it's at Foot Locker, it's approved. We work continuously with our vendors to share the insights we gather during the journey of discovering what our customers find to be the best, coolest sneakers and apparel at any given moment. Ultimately, it is having available the most innovative products from our outstanding suppliers that keeps our banners top of mind with our most influential customers.
There are always competitors who would like to knock us off our spot at the epicenter of sneaker culture. We never take it for granted that we will remain our customers' preferred destination. And we work hard every day to maintain our unparalleled connection with an understanding of the customers of each of our banners. We started a few years ago with the male muse for each of our banners and a female muse for our women's business. We have progressed dramatically since then to identify the core male, female and child customers of each of our banners. And for our kids business, we've even started talking about the parent muses. As I said, it starts with our store associates, who often proudly describe themselves as sneakerheads. And it extends to our marketing teams, our merchants and indeed, everyone in our company. It is vital to our ongoing success at staying at the center of sneaker culture. 
While Lauren mentioned quite a few banner, geographic, channel and category highlights that illustrate how all that excellent work is driving our strong overall performance, she also mentioned a couple of softer parts of our business, which highlights how difficult it is to build and maintain our central position. And the solution to these 2 areas that I'm about to talk about, I firmly believe, are rooted in doing an even better job understanding and engaging with the core customers of these banners. 
First, Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to struggle as seen in the negative comp result and the impairment charge taken this quarter. While part of the challenge is related to German retail in general, I believe the more fundamental issue is that we fired too many customers when we embarked on our banner segmentation strategy in Germany a couple of years ago. We made some assumptions about who our core customers were in these 2 banners and worked with our vendors to deliver product assortments we believe will be right for them. In retrospect, the team there didn't have the same process and discipline for listening to our customers that we have developed at our other banners. So we have now redoubled our efforts to make those connections.
I can't say yet that we have it solved perfectly going forward. And even to the extent that we have improved our own understanding of what motivates the customers of these banners, we still have the challenge of making sure all of our vendors equally understand and allocate the right products. For example, while a sharp point of differentiation at Runners Point is on the performance running side, we know this banner's customers wear sneakers for a lot of other occasion in their life. And we need to be the destination for those sneaker purchases as well. We remain committed to the Runners Point and Sidestep business and believe we can get their performance back to the previous levels of profitability, which is the starting point for the ultimate goal of expanding those banners outside Germany. 
Turning to Eastbay. A big factor in that banner's recent struggles continues to be the overall shift in style preferences away from performance-oriented products to more athletic lifestyle assortments. That said, this is an area where we let ourselves get knocked off-center a bit in connecting with the elite high school athlete, who's always worn both casual athletic and performance footwear and apparel. But we are still strongly positioned with him and her. We have recently hired a new leader for our digital business. Vijay Talwar, who brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and energy to the challenge of again making Eastbay the first choice for that important customer. 
Before we get to your questions, I'd like to just touch on a few product highlights. First of all, one of the most significant dynamics in our industry right now is the continued growth of adidas across multiple platforms. On the lifestyle side, adi Originals, such as Nomad and Superstars, are continuing to be on trend while the performance styles of PureBOOST and Ultra Boost are growing in importance in all of our geographies.
Nike certainly remains our largest vendor by far overall and largest in each of our banners. Lifestyle running continued to be a tremendous strength for Nike with significant sales of Roshe, Huarache, Presto and Max Air across all our markets. The Jordan Brand continues to build popularity around the world. And there was also strength in Foamposites and seasonal boots from Nike. While signature basketball overall remained soft, Nike's Kyrie Irving shoes sold quite well as did the Curry 2.0 and 2.5 product from Under Armour. 
Another strongly uptrending brand in the quarter was PUMA. PUMA Creepers, platforms and Suedes delivered excellent performance for us in almost all of our banners, especially in our women's businesses. While limited to certain banners and geographies, we're also seeing encouraging momentum in other brands, such as Vans, Reebok, ASICs and New Balance. Our boot business, led by Timberland, is still quite important, although it has gotten off to a somewhat slower start this year compared to last year. 
In apparel, I'm very pleased with the mid-single-digit sales increase that Lauren mentioned. We are making progress in our apparel businesses in most of our banners. Overall, apparel profitability is up to the point where margins are close to catching up to the already strong footwear margins. ASPs in apparel were up double digits, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on a more premium assortment. Apparel units, as expected, were down. The windwear category, led by products, such as the Nike Windrunner, continues to be the hottest trend right now. Our overall T-shirt business performed very well, propelled by our own Team Edition group as did CSG fleece and nylon jackets at Champs Sports. 
I'd like to close my remarks by saying how proud I am of the entire team at Foot Locker, Inc. This was our 27th consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and non-GAAP profit growth. And Lauren outlined our belief that we can attain yet another record performance in Q4. We have diligently executed our strategic initiatives over several years and built a high-performing business, not just from a macro level but also from the ground-up. As a business, we strive for consistent, authentic and memorable interactions with each customer who comes into our stores or visits our websites. Between our 3,400 stores and our numerous websites, such interactions happen literally millions of times every day. And it is the preparation, skill and passion of each and every one of our associates that creates the authenticity of these interactions and which motivates our customers to position us at the epicenter of sneaker culture, right where we want to be.

We have great brand partners across all of our geographies and all of our banners. So our consumer, while brand is important to the consumer, cool is more important to the consumer. So they move to where they find the coolest sneaker that appeals to them. That appeal may come from social media. It may come from the group of people they hang out with. It may become from the jeans style that they choose to wear. But we continue to see strength in the key brands that I called out certainly. adidas is on a great run. They're having some -- a lot of success. But we, at the same time, have tremendous successes across the Nike brand. The one place that you called out to me low, signature basketball, is a place that's a little bit softer. With that being said, we saw some good pop on the KD 9 that came out. The Kyrie Irving shoe continues to perform exceptionally well. The Under Armour Curry product, the 2.0 and 2.5 during the quarter, did very well. So it's a combination. And certainly, we see product that we believe is going to excite the customer. Some of it is in signature basketball, some of it is in lifestyle running. But I've talked the last couple of calls that our team does such a tremendous job of moving open-to-buy dollars from vendors in categories. And we don't really think in terms of categories as much as maybe the analyst community does. We think in terms of what's going to motivate the kid to buy. And we create our in-store and online and digital environments to appeal to that. So yes, we see good products coming. And some of them are certainly in performance signature basketball.

So I think -- I applaud them for the HyperAdapt. We all wanted it when Marty McFly had it on. And now we'll get a chance to get it."

But I think what we learned -- probably the biggest learning, we started out very much performance-led with fashion being the second feature of the assortment certainly from an apparel point of view. And the big shift that's happened, Matt, is that we now look from a lifestyle/fashion perspective first and know that the function of the performance aspects have to be built into a lot of the assortment because she wants to look great, but she expects it to perform. So some of the Rihanna product that we launched with PUMA right as we opened the store in late August, beginning of September, people look at it and say, ""Well, that's very fashion-forward for a Foot Locker banner."" And they're right, it is. But that's sort of the attraction that our muse in that banner and the SIX:02 banner has. So the shift has been from performance-led to lifestyle-led with performance attributes. That's both on a -- mostly on an apparel point of view but also on a footwear point of view, right? Some of the Creepers and things that we mentioned in our prepared remarks obviously resonated really well with the SIX:02 consumer. And the energy that we see in the SIX:02 store on 34th Street here is helping us understand what that in-store experience for the consumer should be like. And we'll be able to take those learnings and take it across the other 30 stores in the fleet, and as I mentioned earlier, be ready to expand a bit in the U.S. later in 2017. Once we get it right there, then we can come back to your question about a global impact, Matt."

And then as we look at these long-term objectives and the top line growth, there are infrastructure needs in order to be able to support all of that. So that is the third element of the CapEx. So we do look for that to continue to be elevated go-forward. But we have a very balanced approach to capital structure and have been consistent in meaningful returns of cash to the shareholders. So that is a very important priority to us. And our board looks with us at what we're doing with the dividend and share repurchase on a quarterly basis to make sure that we are competitive there and making the right decisions with those capital dollars. So there are a lot of dynamics. And one of them you rightly point out, as you know, where the cash is located. But as we have described, we really do feel very good about the opportunities in Europe outside the U.S. to further our business. And that would be part of the use of that capital. So we think our approach is balanced and we've got the flexibility to execute it."

And sneaker culture crosses all of the brands and all of the categories. I had mentioned some of the brands that we're seeing specific geographic success with, right? They have a window of opportunity maybe along the I-95 corridor, it may be a California-based thing. But we have a lot of store density in those 2 areas. So some of these brands that I mentioned, ASICS, Vans, they've got huge opportunities in a segment of our stores. And the consumer really -- we like to say the consumer votes with their feet at the end of the day, right? They'd go out and they find what the coolest shoe is.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined this morning by Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who in a moment will provide the details of the company's strong third quarter financial performance; and by Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will highlight the strength of our position in the athletic industry and discuss some key recent merchandise trends. 
First, though, let me give a high-level overview of our results. Driven by a comparable-store sales gain of 4.7%, the company generated earnings of $157 million in the third quarter or $1.17 per share. This strong result includes 2 significant accounting events, a tax adjustment and an impairment charge, which together increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Thus, on a non-GAAP basis, Foot Locker's earnings were $1.13 in the quarter, up 13% from our non-GAAP results of $1 a year ago.
While a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the tables attached to this morning's press release, let me very briefly say that the tax expense adjustments resulted from a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided by Foot Locker in the U.S. to our European business. Driven by the recent strong performance of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new higher valuation resulted in increased deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million, adding $0.07 per share to our GAAP earnings.
Going the other direction was an impairment charge primarily related to certain underperforming store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep, which overall continued its negative sales trend. This charge was $6 million on a pretax basis or $0.03 per share after tax, resulting in the net $0.04 differential between our GAAP earnings of $1.17 per share and our non-GAAP result of $1.13. 
The strong third quarter performance, when added to our first half results, brought our year-to-date non-GAAP earnings to $470 million. This equates to EPS of $3.46, 10% over last year's earnings of $3.14 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
With that summary, let me pass the call to Lauren."

We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the to",1394,"Thank you, John, and good morning to you all. We appreciate your interest in Foot Locker, and thank you for joining us this morning.
As John mentioned, the third quarter marked yet another strong performance for Foot Locker. And it all starts with the top line, where we produced a 4.7% comparable-store sales gain in line with our previous guidance of a mid-single-digit increase. This strong result was on top of last year's robust 8.7% comp gain. In terms of cadence, our comparable sales increased mid-single digits in each month of the quarter. 
Looking at the details. We saw that many of the same trends we have spoken about this year remained unchanged during the third quarter. By category, footwear and apparel were both up mid-single digits while accessories posted a low single-digit decline. Women's footwear was quite strong, posting a double-digit comparable sales gain. Superstar from adi was especially popular with women's and led the increase across virtually all of our geographies and banners where we sell women's products. Our children's footwear business also performed well and was up mid-single digits while our men's footwear sales finished up low single digits.
By category, running and casual footwear were both up in the high single-digit range while basketball was down slightly. Lifestyle running, led by Nike and adi, continued to be very strong while among our casual styles, Stan Smith from adi, Vans Classics and PUMA Suedes and Clydes were top consumer choices. Within basketball, strength in court classic style, such as Superstars, largely offset declines in performance shoes. Average selling prices in footwear were up in the low end of mid-single digits while units were also up low single digits. Unlike a lot of retail, our store traffic in the U.S. was up and our comparable sales in the store segment were up mid-single digits. 
On a percentage basis, the top performer this quarter was SIX:02 with a comp sales increase well into double digits. This exciting performance was driven by footwear with strong gains in PUMA, adi and Nike. Foot Locker Canada continued its strong performance, producing an excellent double-digit increase, driven by strong results in men's, women's and kids. Footwear was up double digits and apparel and accessories were both up high single digits.
Among the male banners in the U.S., the top performance was delivered by Champs Sports, which produced a double-digit comparable sales gain, driven by a mid-teens increase in apparel and a high single-digit gain in footwear. The Foot Locker division in the U.S., which now includes our remaining Lady Foot Locker stores, was up mid-single digits. Previously mentioned, we have found that our Lady Foot Locker customer largely responds to the same influences as the female customers in our Foot Locker stores. Kids Foot Locker, meanwhile, was up in the low end of mid-single digits while Footaction posted a low single-digit gain.
No doubt the most exciting event of the quarter for us was the reopening of our flagship store on 34th Street at the end of August. The grand opening generated tremendous excitement amongst the legions of customers that took part in the launch of the newest, most premium sneaker experience in New York. The space includes not just the pinnacle Foot Locker experience but also contains shops to highlight the best product story of all of our fantastic, innovative vendors. And for me, most exciting of all is the first SIX:02 presence here in New York City, a key step that we believe will build brand awareness for the banner, not just in New York but nationally and even to some extent, internationally. 
Elsewhere among our international divisions, Foot Locker Asia Pacific comped up low single digits. Foot Locker Europe was pressured by declines in traffic, especially in Italy, France and Spain, and produced a low single-digit comp sales decline. Our women's business in Europe stood out with a strong performance in both footwear and apparel. We believe that the current negative traffic trends in Europe will dissipate. Our youthful customers tend to be resilient. And we believe the investments we are making elevate the experience of our European sneaker enthusiasts and build even deeper connections with them will drive future increases in traffic. Our weakest store banner performances were at our Runners Point and Sidestep banners, which continue to face traffic and sales challenges and were down double digits during the quarter.
Our direct-to-customer segment turned in a solid overall performance with an 8.9% comp gain. Our collective store banners' dot-com business in the U.S. continued its strong growth with sales up slightly over 20% while our international direct businesses, including the digital operations of the Foot Locker banner in Europe and Canada, were up approximately 50%. Eastbay, on the other hand, declined high single digits. Dick will provide some perspective during his remarks about this result and our ongoing efforts to improve the performance at Eastbay. Overall, direct-to-customer sales increased to 12.8% of total sales, up from 12.4% a year ago.
Moving to the rest of the income statement. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points to 33.9% of sales. The uptick was driven by merchandise margin, which also improved by 10 basis points. The progress in merchandise margin was the result of lower markdowns in our stores, partially offset by a decrease in the merchandise margin of our direct-to-customer business. As we noted on our previous call, Eastbay, which is still our largest digital banner, continued to be more promotional than in the past in response to weakening traffic with its website.
Our team did another very good job managing expenses during the third quarter. Our SG&A expense rate improved by 20 basis points to 19.4% of sales despite increased marketing costs within the direct-to-customer segment, which we mentioned would persist when we provided guidance on last quarter's call. Depreciation expense increased $40 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Consistent with previous quarters, this increase reflects the incremental investments we are making in our store fleet, our digital businesses and technology to continue to drive greater productivity from all of our assets.
On a GAAP basis, our Q3 tax rate came in at 30.9%, the result of the tax benefit in Europe that John mentioned in his opening remarks. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax rate was 34.9%. We expect to realize a modest ongoing tax rate improvement in future periods from the new intellectual property valuation. This benefit will be included in future guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to manage our inventory effectively and ended the quarter with inventory up 1.9% from a year ago compared to a sales increase of 5.1%. On a constant currency basis, inventory was up 2.2% compared to our 5.5% sales increase. Our inventory remains fresh and exciting. And we are well positioned for the important upcoming holiday season, starting this weekend with this year's edition of the Week of Greatness. It's going to be great, just ask Tom Brady. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $865 million, down $13 million from a year ago. We continued using our balanced approach to capital allocation, including reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. First, capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $193 million and leaving us on track to reach the full year target of approximately $290 million that we mentioned last quarter. Second, we returned $37 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. And finally, we spent $76 million to repurchase 1.15 million shares of common stock. In total, we have returned $463 million to our shareholders through the first 9 months of the year while continuing to make the strategic investments in the business necessary to drive our future growth.
Before I turn the call over to Dick, let me reiterate that for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain, slight improvements in both gross margin and SG&A and a double-digit EPS gain. As a result, we are on track to achieve the annual guidance we gave you at the beginning of 2016, a mid-single-digit comparable sales increase and a double-digit gain in EPS.
Let me now hand the call to Dick to discuss our important leadership role in the industry and highlight a few of the major product trends this quarter."

Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, o",2036,"Thanks, Lauren. Good morning all, and thanks for joining us. In our last call, I began my remarks by describing the many dimensions of leadership that Foot Locker has in the athletic industry. These dimensions of leadership include our excellent people, our strong brands, our extensive global reach, the diversity of the categories in which we operate and ultimately, our outstanding financial performance.
The very first dimension I discussed is actually the most important one, and that is the leadership position we have with the core customers of each of our banners. I want to come back to this aspect because it is a crucial element of our ongoing success story. In the past, we have talked about the casualization of the dressing styles around the world and the ongoing adoption of healthier, more active lifestyles, both of which support steady growth of our athletic footwear and apparel businesses. But our team's work with our customers is much more dynamic and powerful than that. It comes down to this, our brands are at the epicenter of sneaker culture. And we work hard every day to stay there because what drives sneaker culture is changing all the time. 
What is sneaker culture? It means different things to different people. But the heart of it is a true, deep passion for sneakers. And what defines the epicenter of sneaker culture is a bit different for each of our core customers. The forces driving a love for sneakers with our muse at Champs Sports are not exactly the same as the forces motivating our customers at Footaction or Foot Locker. And the Foot Locker customer of New York is different than the one in L.A. or London, Paris, Milan or for that matter, Sydney or Auckland. Sometimes, it's a musician. Sometimes, it's an athlete. And very often, that athlete style off the court or pitch is even more influential than what he or she accomplishes in their sport.
Our female customers have an even broader range of style influences. And not surprisingly, the muse at Lady Foot Locker is very different than the one at SIX:02. That's one of the key reasons we separated the management of these 2 businesses. With the ubiquity of social media, there are, of course, some overarching style themes that each of these sneaker lovers share. But it is our own passion for sneakers and our understanding of these subtle differences that are key to our ability to maintain critical points of differentiation between our banners and from the competition, keeping our interaction with our customers authentic.
Authenticity is a key concept in connecting with the customers, who are affectionately called sneakerheads, those who buy the most sneakers and who set or influence of the athletic footwear and apparel styles for their peers. We strive to be authentic with our customers in the products we showcase and the quality of the physical spaces they shop in and the seamlessness of the digital interaction we have with them and in the knowledge and enthusiasm of our associates as they engage with our customers each and every day.
In terms of physical locations, Lauren mentioned the high-energy flagship store on 34th Street that we reopened in August, which is off to a great start. If there's an epicenter of sneaker culture in New York, it's got to be on 34th Street. This quarter, we will also debut our exciting new combined Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and SIX:02 stores near Times Square. That grand opening is slated for January. 
The best thing about sneakerheads is that they come from all over, in all shapes and sizes, ethnicities, genders and ages. In fact, kids are starting earlier and earlier to develop into sneaker aficionados. We actually have 4-year-old sneakerhead customers. Sometimes, their parents, who also grew up loving sneakers, get them involved. And sometimes, the kids push the parents. But either way, it has been a huge benefit to our leading position in the kids business. 
Although some kids grow out of being sneakerheads as they become teenagers, and then adults. Fortunately, it turns out a lot of them don't. It is a common occurrence for shareholders to tell me they have a teenage son or daughter who is absolutely passionate about sneakers. And on more than one occasion, I've also had the pleasure of talking in depth about our various business strategies with the portfolio manager, where the meeting was wrapping up, has come up to me privately and said, ""Hey, I get it, I've got 30 pairs of sneakers in the closet myself."" I usually tell them that with 30 pairs, they're just getting started. 
As great as our vendors are, and they're all excellent, style preferences of our customers shift between them, which is why being a multi-brand retailer is so important. Our vendors have certainly come to recognize and support the critical position we have built within the industry in terms of providing that feeling of authenticity to our customers. As our tagline says, if it's at Foot Locker, it's approved. We work continuously with our vendors to share the insights we gather during the journey of discovering what our customers find to be the best, coolest sneakers and apparel at any given moment. Ultimately, it is having available the most innovative products from our outstanding suppliers that keeps our banners top of mind with our most influential customers.
There are always competitors who would like to knock us off our spot at the epicenter of sneaker culture. We never take it for granted that we will remain our customers' preferred destination. And we work hard every day to maintain our unparalleled connection with an understanding of the customers of each of our banners. We started a few years ago with the male muse for each of our banners and a female muse for our women's business. We have progressed dramatically since then to identify the core male, female and child customers of each of our banners. And for our kids business, we've even started talking about the parent muses. As I said, it starts with our store associates, who often proudly describe themselves as sneakerheads. And it extends to our marketing teams, our merchants and indeed, everyone in our company. It is vital to our ongoing success at staying at the center of sneaker culture. 
While Lauren mentioned quite a few banner, geographic, channel and category highlights that illustrate how all that excellent work is driving our strong overall performance, she also mentioned a couple of softer parts of our business, which highlights how difficult it is to build and maintain our central position. And the solution to these 2 areas that I'm about to talk about, I firmly believe, are rooted in doing an even better job understanding and engaging with the core customers of these banners. 
First, Runners Point and Sidestep banners continue to struggle as seen in the negative comp result and the impairment charge taken this quarter. While part of the challenge is related to German retail in general, I believe the more fundamental issue is that we fired too many customers when we embarked on our banner segmentation strategy in Germany a couple of years ago. We made some assumptions about who our core customers were in these 2 banners and worked with our vendors to deliver product assortments we believe will be right for them. In retrospect, the team there didn't have the same process and discipline for listening to our customers that we have developed at our other banners. So we have now redoubled our efforts to make those connections.
I can't say yet that we have it solved perfectly going forward. And even to the extent that we have improved our own understanding of what motivates the customers of these banners, we still have the challenge of making sure all of our vendors equally understand and allocate the right products. For example, while a sharp point of differentiation at Runners Point is on the performance running side, we know this banner's customers wear sneakers for a lot of other occasion in their life. And we need to be the destination for those sneaker purchases as well. We remain committed to the Runners Point and Sidestep business and believe we can get their performance back to the previous levels of profitability, which is the starting point for the ultimate goal of expanding those banners outside Germany. 
Turning to Eastbay. A big factor in that banner's recent struggles continues to be the overall shift in style preferences away from performance-oriented products to more athletic lifestyle assortments. That said, this is an area where we let ourselves get knocked off-center a bit in connecting with the elite high school athlete, who's always worn both casual athletic and performance footwear and apparel. But we are still strongly positioned with him and her. We have recently hired a new leader for our digital business. Vijay Talwar, who brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and energy to the challenge of again making Eastbay the first choice for that important customer. 
Before we get to your questions, I'd like to just touch on a few product highlights. First of all, one of the most significant dynamics in our industry right now is the continued growth of adidas across multiple platforms. On the lifestyle side, adi Originals, such as Nomad and Superstars, are continuing to be on trend while the performance styles of PureBOOST and Ultra Boost are growing in importance in all of our geographies.
Nike certainly remains our largest vendor by far overall and largest in each of our banners. Lifestyle running continued to be a tremendous strength for Nike with significant sales of Roshe, Huarache, Presto and Max Air across all our markets. The Jordan Brand continues to build popularity around the world. And there was also strength in Foamposites and seasonal boots from Nike. While signature basketball overall remained soft, Nike's Kyrie Irving shoes sold quite well as did the Curry 2.0 and 2.5 product from Under Armour. 
Another strongly uptrending brand in the quarter was PUMA. PUMA Creepers, platforms and Suedes delivered excellent performance for us in almost all of our banners, especially in our women's businesses. While limited to certain banners and geographies, we're also seeing encouraging momentum in other brands, such as Vans, Reebok, ASICs and New Balance. Our boot business, led by Timberland, is still quite important, although it has gotten off to a somewhat slower start this year compared to last year. 
In apparel, I'm very pleased with the mid-single-digit sales increase that Lauren mentioned. We are making progress in our apparel businesses in most of our banners. Overall, apparel profitability is up to the point where margins are close to catching up to the already strong footwear margins. ASPs in apparel were up double digits, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on a more premium assortment. Apparel units, as expected, were down. The windwear category, led by products, such as the Nike Windrunner, continues to be the hottest trend right now. Our overall T-shirt business performed very well, propelled by our own Team Edition group as did CSG fleece and nylon jackets at Champs Sports. 
I'd like to close my remarks by saying how proud I am of the entire team at Foot Locker, Inc. This was our 27th consecutive quarter of meaningful sales and non-GAAP profit growth. And Lauren outlined our belief that we can attain yet another record performance in Q4. We have diligently executed our strategic initiatives over several years and built a high-performing business, not just from a macro level but also from the ground-up. As a business, we strive for consistent, authentic and memorable interactions with each customer who comes into our stores or visits our websites. Between our 3,400 stores and our numerous websites, such interactions happen literally millions of times every day. And it is the preparation, skill and passion of each and every one of our associates that creates the authenticity of these interactions and which motivates our customers to position us at the epicenter of sneaker culture, right where we want to be.

We have great brand partners across all of our geographies and all of our banners. So our consumer, while brand is important to the consumer, cool is more important to the consumer. So they move to where they find the coolest sneaker that appeals to them. That appeal may come from social media. It may come from the group of people they hang out with. It may become from the jeans style that they choose to wear. But we continue to see strength in the key brands that I called out certainly. adidas is on a great run. They're having some -- a lot of success. But we, at the same time, have tremendous successes across the Nike brand. The one place that you called out to me low, signature basketball, is a place that's a little bit softer. With that being said, we saw some good pop on the KD 9 that came out. The Kyrie Irving shoe continues to perform exceptionally well. The Under Armour Curry product, the 2.0 and 2.5 during the quarter, did very well. So it's a combination. And certainly, we see product that we believe is going to excite the customer. Some of it is in signature basketball, some of it is in lifestyle running. But I've talked the last couple of calls that our team does such a tremendous job of moving open-to-buy dollars from vendors in categories. And we don't really think in terms of categories as much as maybe the analyst community does. We think in terms of what's going to motivate the kid to buy. And we create our in-store and online and digital environments to appeal to that. So yes, we see good products coming. And some of them are certainly in performance signature basketball. But they're spread across the range of product offerings."

As we head into the holiday season, our team is certainly ready and prepared and the product assortments will draw them back. There's great marketing that's going on. The team over in Europe is doing a fantastic job. Lauren referred to our Week of Greatness. And this year's campaign, I think, is by far the best that we've done.

The connectivity with the consumer, I think the Foot Locker Europe team has a deep connectivity and understanding and engagement with their consumer base. And that varies country-to-country, obviously. The North of Europe and the South of Europe has very different buying patterns and buying characteristics and product desires. The Sidestep and Runners Point business have, relatively speaking, no apparel. I mean, there's a little bit of performance running apparel in Runners Point stores. But part of the strength of Foot Locker Europe is a really, really good footwear business in general and a much improved apparel business over the last 6 or 7 quarters. So those are -- probably the biggest thing is that Runners Point and Sidestep don't have the ability to diversify from a geography point of view or a family of business point of view.

And the big shift that's happened, Matt, is that we now look from a lifestyle/fashion perspective first and know that the function of the performance aspects have to be built into a lot of the assortment because she wants to look great, but she expects it to perform. So some of the Rihanna product that we launched with PUMA right as we opened the store in late August, beginning of September, people look at it and say, ""Well, that's very fashion-forward for a Foot Locker banner."" And they're right, it is. But that's sort of the attraction that our muse in that banner and the SIX:02 banner has. So the shift has been from performance-led to lifestyle-led with performance attributes. That's both on a -- mostly on an apparel point of view but also on a footwear point of view, right? Some of the Creepers and things that we mentioned in our prepared remarks obviously resonated really well with the SIX:02 consumer. And the energy that we see in the SIX:02 store on 34th Street here is helping us understand what that in-store experience for the consumer should be like. And we'll be able to take those learnings and take it across the other 30 stores in the fleet, and as I mentioned earlier, be ready to expand a bit in the U.S. later in 2017.

So yes, we're making progress in the remodels. But we've got a 3,400-door fleet in multiple geographies across multiple banners and across multiple formats. So we continue to plan on investing on the remodels. And our team is always looking for the next thing. And we know that we'll be back to update or change as we move forward. But even the later renditions of our Willowbrook's or GSP at Footaction or our Tyrone's at Champs, they've got slight modifications to them, things that we've learned from the early remodels that we've been able to improve on in the later remodels. So we're going to continue the program. We're in the mid-30s, I think, right now. That's what the forecast is for the end of the year, mid- to high 40s of the fleet having been touched. We want to change the remodel program when we hit the last store that passes the hurdles. But I don't know exactly where that's going to be.

So we work close with the vendors on allocations and distribution. Certainly, we try to get more. We try to get what we think is the appropriate amount for our stores. But it's an ongoing sort of conversation. And as significant partners with our suppliers, I think we end up with -- I don't know if our fair share is the right way to put it, but we end up with a model that the consumers are driven by because they know they have to get into the stores and get it or they might not have the chance.

As I said in my prepared comments, I don't think it's necessarily going to come back suddenly.

So to think that one brand will get it right 100% of the time, as good as our brands are, I don't think that, that's going to happen. So the consumer always wants choice. And our consumer is motivated by cool, by sneaker culture. They're not motivated -- it's not a basketball culture, it's sneaker culture that drives us. And sneaker culture crosses all of the brands and all of the categories. I had mentioned some of the brands that we're seeing specific geographic success with, right? They have a window of opportunity maybe along the I-95 corridor, it may be a California-based thing. But we have a lot of store density in those 2 areas. So some of these brands that I mentioned, ASICS, Vans, they've got huge opportunities in a segment of our stores. And the consumer really -- we like to say the consumer votes with their feet at the end of the day, right? They'd go out and they find what the coolest shoe is. So I like -- we've always been a multi-branded store. And I think the work on 34th Street to really showcase those brands, the work in all of our remodels to showcase brands brings the brand strength together and allows us to tell powerful stories around the great products that our manufacturing partners deliver to us. So the multi-branded strategy, the strength of those brands is again an important part of our success."
