This morning, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015. Total sales for the quarter increased to $5.3 billion and same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%. Total sales",2678,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015. Total sales for the quarter increased to $5.3 billion and same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%. Total sales for fiscal 2015, which included nearly 7 months of Family Dollar sales, were $15.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $229 million and adjusted net income was $239.4 million, near the high-end of our range of guidance. EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.01. I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the fourth quarter. Sales were solid and at the midpoint of our range of guidance. SG&A expenses were leveraged and well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector-leading operating margins and earnings were very near the top of our guidance. Our customer base is large and it's growing and we continue to meet our milestones and remain on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have truly an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization and the strategic rationale for the combination continues to be as compelling as ever. In early stages of integration, there had been no surprises that diminish our vision and plans for value creation. In fact, as we improve retail operations, there is increased enthusiasm for the opportunity to grow and to serve more customers in more ways as a combined company. We have confidence in our disciplined approach to continue improving the customer experience at Family Dollar and in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real time, our eyes are on the horizon as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
Only 2 quarters into the integration, our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating effectively to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the fourth quarter were numerous, including another solid quarter for our Dollar Tree banner. As expected, Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit same-store sales increase. Same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%, and that was on top of a strong 5.6% increase in the fourth quarter a year ago. Same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products and sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories include party supplies, beauty and eyewear, snacks and beverage and candy and food. Geographically, Dollar Tree's same-store sales growth was strongest in the Northeast and Midwest. 
I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was the 32nd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. That's 32 straight quarters, 8 straight years of comp growth and everything is still a dollar. Cycling comps are 5.6% last year and through a difficult consumer environment, fourth quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often, and we're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter.  Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our customer, our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchant teams do a tremendous job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the fourth quarter. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, store presentations boldly communicated a message to our customers that Dollar Tree was the go-to store for basics and your holiday needs. In early November, we focused on first of the month basic consumables and Thanksgiving-related foods like chicken broth and vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care customer needs related to holiday meals, with baking basics, mixing bowls, foil pans, turkey basters and food storage containers. And we addressed the customers' needs related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers. Our Home For the Holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods like cookies and mix and party mix and everything was just $1. Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a sharp transition to Christmas holiday decorations, toyland and great gift ideas. And the merchant stores continue to build on our Last 10 Days strategy by bringing all of the last minute categories together and remerchandising the front of the store with purpose. Our goal is to be to the gift supplier headquarters for items like holiday items, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. Our customers understand that if you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree the store for you. If you're buying your wrap and supplies anywhere else, you're paying too much. 
In addition to our seasonal energy, customers continue to look at Dollar Tree for their basic needs. Throughout the quarter, our stores continued to highlight and promote our Million Dollars Brands. These are brands that they know and trust like Pringles, Nabisco, Scottie's, Crest Toothpaste and many more. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 63 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 11 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 58 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores and we rebannered 52 Deal$ stores to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 184 Dollar Tree projects during the fourth quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner square footage increased 10.3% compared to the prior year, and we ended the fiscal year with a total of 5,954 Dollar Tree stores across North America, an increase of 587 stores this year. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive to business initiatives include category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. We're driving the business with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. We want our customers to know what season it is when they come in the front door. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In fourth quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 142 additional Dollar Tree stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,287 stores and growing. Our plan is to roll out freezers and coolers to 400 additional stores in 2016. We're on schedule with our planned conversion of our Deal$ store location. As we announced in October, we planned to dedicate our full energy and resources to our 2 primary banners. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. As planned, the rebannering of our 222 Deal$ stores commenced in January, and we're on track to complete this project on schedule. 
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest DC and Cherokee County, South Carolina is on schedule and on budget. This  $1.5 million -- excuse me, 1.5 million square foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to begin shipping products from this new facility in July. To support continued growth in Western markets, we're expanding our Stockton, California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is also scheduled to be completed by midyear. 
Turning to the Family Dollar banner, we continue to make meaningful progress on the Family Dollar integration. In the fourth quarter, Family Dollar Stores completed the clearance of non-go forward product at the beginning of November and quickly moved to the impact of the holiday merchandise set. In caps were reclaimed for the holiday period and for the January promotional resets. Systems on hand are cleaner and our service levels continue to improve. Just over 2 quarters in, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked we cleaned up old inventory and the in caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. Regarding sales for the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. Same-store sales increased as the result of growth in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic leading the way. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables, with slightly higher sales growth in consumables. Sales were positive each month with the strongest sales increases in December. Geographically, comparable store sales at Family Dollar were strongest in the West and the mid-Atlantic. 
For the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 65 new Family Dollar Stores and we relocated or expanded 42 Family Dollar stores for a total of 107 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we rebannered 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. We completed the required divestiture of 325 stores to Sycamore partners at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We ended the fiscal year with 7,897 Family Dollar Stores and a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,851 stores across North America. Just like Dollar Tree, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar Stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation. Merchants at stores are working hard to be first of the month ready and weekend-ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, the role of private label products while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic in-stock levels. Additionally, we're in the process of rolling out our Smart Ways To Save program. The value elements of Smart Ways To Save are a combination of everyday low price elements and items, strategically planned sales and price drop promotions, incredible $1 Wow items and an enhanced assortment of named brands, private label name brand equivalents and value brands. In order to earn back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visit, we're committed to improving the customer experience. There is a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions. We want them to be bright, clean and free of clutter. The customer experience full in stock stores easy to shop trusted value focused on the merchandise relevance. We have to have what our customers need and want and we're focused on customer engagement, friendly and informed associates. By identifying and establishing appropriate retailing disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. I am very pleased to report that recent results from our customer satisfaction surveys are showing meaningful improvement in fourth quarter versus prior year customer scores in each of our 4 primary survey categories, which are store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout.  Continued improvements in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar becoming the neighborhood store of choice for our customer's shopping trips. We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics, with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement while reducing cost, leveraging our shared services and back-office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn and we will invest prescriptively while measuring return on our investments. As always, our P&L will continue to be managed line by line, quarter-by-quarter, with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our expectations. 
We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime cost of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in 4 primary areas. First of all, sourcing and procurement; second, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; third, distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but at this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12 months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact item match initiative to provide the lowest cost on identical items across both banners is complete with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues with outstanding result. There's more to come here. We're achieving planned savings from harmonizing of payment terms, auctions are at piece and a formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continue to grow and meet expectations. 
During the fourth quarter, we rebannered an additional 58 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree, bringing our total of converted stores for fiscal 2015 to 205 stores. This slightly exceeded our target of 200 conversions for the year. The preliminary results are meeting expectations overall, and feedback from customers has been positive. We plan to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Trees in 2016 and our analysis will continue. Ultimately, our strategy is to have the right banner in the best location to serve our customers. We're finalizing the supply chain roadmap, and we'll soon be piloting our first co-banner distribution center. With a cross organizational functional team, we are integrating our warehouse management systems, and we're making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability and the merits of shipping both banners out of our facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Our first pilot facility in St. George's, Utah, is planned to be operational before the third quarter. 
We continue to make progress on reducing costs through a shared services model. We're combining back-office functions to support both banners through a shared services organization. Over time, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, indirect sourcing and procurement, real estate and construction, legal, strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost-effective approach. With less than a year into the integration, and we have made tremendous progress, we still have a great deal of work ahead of us. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long-term. It's a process. We're employing a well planned, thoughtful, low risk strategic approach that will benefit our long-term shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial performance and our initial outlook for 2016."

As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons are difficult. However, we have included tables with our press releases, which we believe will be helpful in better understanding the components of our business. Total sales for the fourth quarter grew 117% to $5.37 billion, which includes our second full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. Dollar Tree segment sales increase to 8.6% to $2.69 billion, while Family Dollar segment sales decreased 2.7% to $2.68 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by 205 rebannered stores and 325 divested stores. 
Same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7% versus a very strong 5.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.3%. All of the recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deal$ stores are considered new stores and excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $734.5 million or 80% to $1.65 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the prior-year quarter. Majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $673.7 million. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 36.4% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.1% in the prior year's fourth quarter. Approximately 1/2 of the 70 basis point declined as a percent of sales was related to actual and accrued markdowns associated with the planned conversion of all Deal$ stores location. Other factors contributing to the year-over-year decline in gross margin rate was occupancy costs, higher distribution costs and shrink, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 25.2% during the fourth quarter compared with 25.1% in the comparable prior-year period. Including the $15.9 million inventory step up monetization, gross profit margin was 25.9% for the quarter. The improvement of 80 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark on and lower markdowns partially offset by higher occupancy costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter for the combined organization increased 121% to $1.18 billion from $534.5 million in last year's fourth quarter, the majority of the $648.4 million increase related to $608.4 million of Family Dollar expense. Q4 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 21.4%, a 20 basis point as a percent to sales improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.3 million of acquisitions and integration-related costs while the prior year included $6.7 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 21.2% for Q4 compared to 21.3% for the prior year's quarter. This 10 basis point improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs including retirement planned contributions and store bonuses, and was partially offset by higher operating corporate expenses, including legal fees and costs associated with the Deal$ store conversion. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 22.7% compared to 20.6% in the prior year quarter. The current year included a $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization, $16 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, $8.9 million of severance costs and integration costs. The prior year's comparable period included $10.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 20.9% from 20.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation, repairs, professional fees and divestiture-related costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $17.4 million to $407.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 60 basis points to 15.2% compared to 15.8% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $1.9 million to $134.0 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the 205 rebanners stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar Stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 10 basis points to 5% compared to 4.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period. Non-operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $117.2 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $114.9 million in the quarter, which included an acceleration of $19 million in non-cash deferred financing costs associated with our prepayment of long-term debt of $1 billion in January. For the fourth quarter, the company had net income of $229 million or $0.97 per diluted share. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, as detailed in the press release tables, were $239.4 million and $1.01 per diluted share. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35% compared to 36.4% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attribute to an increase in the work opportunity tax credits in relation to the income for the fourth quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. 
Looking at the balance sheet, combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $736.1 million compared to $864.1 million at the end of Q4 and as noted, we did make a $1 billion debt prepayment in late January. Our outstanding long-term debt is now approximately $7.5 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 18.9% greater than at the same time last year, while [indiscernible] increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling square-foot increased 7.7%. The primary contributors to the year-over-year increase in inventory levels relate to the West Coast port disruption we experienced a year ago and earlier Easter in 2016 and an earlier Chinese new year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, end of year inventory on a selling square foot basis increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels of key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the first quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores, including 350 new Dollar Tree stores and 200 new Family Dollar Stores, the remodel, relocation or expansion of approximately 200 stores, the rebannering of approximately 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores and the rebanner of the 158 remaining Deal$ stores for a total of more than 1,000 store projects in 2016. In addition, we'll add frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores. We have IT system enhancements and integration projects. The completion of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center and the completion of our stock in California distribution center expansion. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $174.9 million for the fourth quarter. This includes purchase accounting related costs of $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $60 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $54.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $8 million for Q1 and $5 million for Q2 depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the [indiscernible] accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q1 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
Turning to sales and earnings per share guidance, for modeling purposes, our initial outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions: As a reminder, at the begin of Q4 2015, we divested 325 Family Dollar Stores that represent approximately $500 million in annual sales and $45.5 million in operating income. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar Stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. The stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebannered strategy analysis and our outlook for the same-store sales. We will continue our initiatives to rebanner stores. First, focusing on rebannering all Deal$ stores and then we plan to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Trees. Each will be 1 week earlier than the prior year. This represents an estimated $10 million headwind of sales. Inventory step up amortization will be approximately $6 million in Q1 and $2 million in Q2. We are budgeting lower diesel fuel costs than a year ago with the first half providing the most benefit. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016, and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2016. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.6% for the first quarter and 36.8% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q1 and for the full year. 
For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion, and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.75 to $0.83. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 132%. Sales and earnings per share outlook for the full fiscal year, we are forecasting total sales to range from $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $3.35 to $3.65. These estimates are based on low single digit same store sales increase and 4% sales square footage growth.

I want to close by saying the strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is as compelling as ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers. While we are still in the early stages of the integration process, I am very pleased with our process and our progress. Gary Philbin and the leadership team at Family Dollar are working to plan effectively and efficiently. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the year 3. I believe we can exceed this expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lower end costs both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I would tell you that, as always, we will deploy a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
I'll close the prepared remarks by saying the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 32 conservative quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets while serving more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store, every day.  Our future has never been brighter.

For the first part of the question, we're not limited by the merchandise assortment or the price point. We have more assortment than ever. Our values are better than ever, our stores are larger, they're -- more merchandise and more assortment than we've ever have. So there's no limitation to that. If you look at the fourth quarter largely, we're up against a very big fourth quarter last year, 5.6% comp and the year before. So basically, in sort of a tough economy, we were up against a fairly difficult comparison, 5.6%, and I think the 1.7 comp that you see is admirable considering what we faced with that comp last year. As to China, the sourcing continues to be strong and vibrant. We still import a lot of product. About 40% [ph] of our businesses in product that we import and that continues our pricing out of China has been very positive. We've been able to not only improve values in our product but taking the lower cost and turning that into more value for the customer. But also, we've been able to reduce costs on the things that we buy every quarter, every year that we keep in our stores all the time. So the basics we've been able to reduce cost on that, especially on the last trip. You have a follow-up question?"

And to the point, we've historically said we're competitive in the markets we're in and that's important because you have to be to get good employees at the end of the day. I don't think that's really changed but it is within the guidance. As you look at the synergies, and you look at the costs achieved, obviously, we have an expectation that we will achieve synergies this year. There are synergies baked in, we haven't specifically said the dollars, and part of that is due to the timing is a little bit hard to nail specifically down. We'd be well on our way to meeting or beating the first year run rate of $75 million of synergies. So I think we've baked things in accordingly.

We model a densely the Dollar Tree model to come up with a and then we went through the process of reviewing those stores, actually, going out and sending people out to visit the sites and put their eyes on it as well as having the analysis. So from that is how we picked the first 200, 300 stores now. We'll continue the analysis. I would tell you that I haven't learned a whole lot different from what we first did in regard to and analyzing the Family Dollar stores again, they are underperforming Family Dollar Stores that can put through the Dollar Tree real estate model. And from the Dollar Tree real estate model, we came with a sales projection. And from that, we need what we thought we could do as a Dollar Tree. So that's how we chose them. I don't think -- it's really early. One of the reasons we're doing 100 exhibition instead of maybe the fact that we would like to let the first 200 sort of burn in and have a few months. Some of them we have only had a few weeks on with results and most we have a few months. So with a little more time that I think we'd probably find some more opportunity to improve that model and to improve the location and the rebannering project. But I will tell you, it is exciting. The rebannering is absolutely hitting our expectations of what we can deliver and, by the way, I think the running better stores, obviously, we can improve as we do in all Dollar Tree stores from opening to really going after the customer in those markets and running the great stores for those neighborhoods."

We don't have to take away from it to invest in the customer. We can run our business better still. And it's driven by just a few factors. First of all, we got to improve our DC costs. By improving our DC costs, we'll be able to improve our operating margin. By improving our -- by the use of better staffing models and leveraging engineered standards, we can improve our DC costs. Our shrink is higher than it should be. It's grown over the last couple of years. We can improve that. We've always been able to run a very well managed shrink component in our business. And I expect that we're going to get back to better shrink number. But unfortunately, Shrink, as you know, has a tail. Once you know it, you see it then all the initiatives that you do to bring it back in line sort of don't show up until you cycle through some inventories in the life. But we're on top of it, and we can improve our shrink. We can also improve -- we'll leverage our occupancy with our comp store sales increases with had 32 straight quarters. Whether it's 2% or 3% or 4%, will continue to leverage those fixed costs with our comp sales increase. Another big thing is by leveraging the combined companies, as an individual banner, 1 plus 1 does not equal 2 here. As we start bringing together our shared services for both banners, we're going to lower cost across both banners in the back office functions. So there's room for us to continue to grow our comp sales.

That's a wide net, as you might imagine, not only when you think about all the things we buy. So merchandise is merchandise, but when you look at all those services and goods that we buy as organizations, being able to leverage that across both organizations, streamline processes, determine the best way to go forward for both banners is really very exciting and very powerful. So that by far, is the biggest bucket. The second-biggest bucket that we spoke to in the past is the rebannering process and taking underperforming stores and turning them into stores that are performing at a higher level at an average Dollar Tree rate. So that's the second one. The third and fourth buckets are smaller. We've always said that the distribution and logistics has a chance to be a big number, but it's a longer-term project. So to Bob's point, when he was speaking to the work being done today looking at systems and how you ship both banners out of one distribution center, that potentially has a big payback. It is a little further down the road. That's kind of directionally how to think about it."

And again, to the point of what we're trying to do there and as to Bob  said we could get do better from shrink thing other items which we are not happy with our performance this year we've obviously got teams focused on that. But that was a headwind. What was really positive within the day was the fact that our merchandise costs continue to be better. The mark on was up and so we're buying better, freight was a benefit so a lot of things going really well there, that's very positive and we'll continue to be positively believe as we go forward. I think the other thing I would say about the Dollar Tree business is even on a lower comp for the quarter or even the year, we are able to leverage our SG&A expenses. So to me, that's very powerful to the model. There's a lot of companies who would not be able to leverage their SG&A at this type of a comp level so I guess it's a disciplined approach as we go forward. I think, speaking to the Family Dollar business, I think in general, I think the gross profit came in about where we thought it would. We have made some good strides there, the team again a lot of for getting down to make sure we get some of the best net debt cost that we can in the system and be able to track that and base our business off of that so that's very positive; I think as we spoke to in the prepared remarks, some of the headwinds as far from comparability standpoint relate to incentive compensation, divestiture costs and some things like that. So overall, I know that there were a lot of big surprises. Obviously, if sales maybe would have been more towards -- the good thing is sales in the middle of the range, earnings were on the top end of the range but I think with the flow through is actually pretty good at the end of the day.

As we look to the purchase accounting items that we just talked about since the day of the first quarter, you'll continue to see favorable lease rights amortization, it's about $18.7 million for Q1, $74 million for the year and the $18.7 million really steps down about $200,000 a quarter roughly at the end of the day. And then you have additional depreciation above historical run rate related to the revaluation of assets and the change in policies. And basically, that's about $8 million in Q1 and $5 million in Q2. So those are really the items as we see it. That's again why we gave them to you at the end of the day in the prepared remarks, that should be able to help you to do any of the adjustments you want to do and your processes.

Let me start by maybe just describing one of the reasons we did the acquisition was to have 2 compelling banners. So this is not an exercise to turn Family Dollar into Dollar Tree, and so we are rooted in -- the customers we serve and where we serve them. I want to make sure we're very clear. We're going to have ever productive Family Dollar banner with compelling assortments that we think fit the bill for folks that shop us and we thought we revolves an awful lot around first of months and delivery in basics and giving them items that -- on a discretionary basis, they need to round out their shopping trip. So starting with that, I would say, that's where we're grounded. But part of the synergy effort is having our merchants sit together. And just got back from our most recent trip in China, where both our Family Dollar and Dollar Tree merchants are able to sit in the same room and take a look at items. So that's going to be a piece trip after trip. Our merchants can sit in the same room and find the things that fit for Family Dollar that for us means opening price points, great value, items that can be imported that are private brands. All those things are going to take shape as we continue iterations of our merchants staying together. There's going to be some items that you might see in both banners, but if you ever go into a Dollar Tree or Family Dollar and mistake one for the other, we really missed the mark on that assortment. You're going to see 2 compelling stores and assortments, and quite frankly, even on the real estate side, where the live, which really is the growth curve for both banners as we go forward. So I hope that helps."

Focusing money in their pocket to spend any want to be right. So all of the things we have been working getting the non-go forward venture to get our hands better so that we can have our shelves better stocked, that's the effort we've made up to this point to go into the springtime.

But I would tell you an awful lot of what we're working on is delivering the basics everyday, which our customer research says they'll give us credit for that if we're able to deliver on that, week in, week out, month in, month out. As far as promotional strategy, you might see we introduced Smart Ways To Save, which really for me is a way of tying together what our customers are going to see. Our ads will reflect our stores. And so when you think about how you are to say about Family Dollar, our customers are giving us credit now for every day low price. Of course, we have always had drivers in our sale items. The company even before we bought them certainly had over 1,000 $1 Wow items in the store that customers love to shop. We have an extensive private brands program that certainly [indiscernible] and what we're introducing us price drop which is nothing new compared to other retailers but for us, it is a way of delivering value to our customers and some of the items they shop most often.

This morning, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015. Total sales for the quarter increased to $5.37 billion and same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%. Total sales for fiscal 2015, which included nearly 7 months of Family Dollar sales, were $15.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $229 million and adjusted net income was $239.4 million, near the high-end of our range of guidance. EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.01. I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the fourth quarter. Sales were solid and at the midpoint of our range of guidance. SG&A expenses were leveraged and well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector-leading operating margins and earnings were very near the top of our guidance. Our customer base is large and it's growing and we continue to meet our milestones and remain on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have truly an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization and the strategic rationale for the combination continues to be as compelling as ever. In the early stages of integration, there have been no surprises that diminished our vision and plans for value creation. In fact, as we improve retail operations, there is increased enthusiasm for the opportunity to grow and to serve more customers in more ways as a combined company. We have confidence in our disciplined approach to continue improving the customer experience at Family Dollar and in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real time, our eyes are on the horizon as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
Only 2 quarters into the integration, our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating effectively to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the fourth quarter were numerous, including another solid quarter for our Dollar Tree banner. As expected, Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit same-store sales increase. Same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%, and that was on top of a strong 5.6% increase in the fourth quarter a year ago. Same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products, and sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories include party supplies, beauty and eyewear, snacks and beverage and candy and food. Geographically, Dollar Tree's same-store sales growth was strongest in the Northeast and Midwest. 
I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of Dollar Tree business. This was the 32nd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. That's 32 straight quarters, 8 straight years of comp growth and everything is still a dollar. Cycling comps are 5.6% last year and through a difficult consumer environment, fourth quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often, and we're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our customer, our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchant teams do a tremendous job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the fourth quarter. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
As we enter fourth quarter, store presentations boldly communicated a message to our customers that Dollar Tree was the go-to store for basics and your holiday needs. In early November, we focused on first of the month basic consumables and Thanksgiving-related foods like chicken broth and vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care of customer needs related to holiday meals, with baking basics, mixing bowls, foil pans, turkey basters and food storage containers. And we addressed the customers' needs related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers. Our home for the holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods; like cookies and [indiscernible] and party mix and everything was just $1. Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a swift transition to Christmas holiday decorations, Toyland and great gift ideas. And the merchant stores continue to build on our Last 10 Days strategy by bringing all of the last minute categories together and remerchandising the front of the store with a purpose. Our goal is to be the gift supplier headquarters for items like holiday tents,, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. Our customers understand that if you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree is the store for you. If you're buying, you wrap and supplies anywhere else, you're paying too much. 
In addition to our seasonal energy, customers continue to look at Dollar Tree for their basic needs. Throughout the quarter, our stores continued to highlight and promote our million dollar brands. These are brands that they know and trust like Pringles, Nabisco, Scotties, Crest Toothpaste and many more. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 63 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 11 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 58 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores and we rebannered 52 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 184 Dollar Tree projects during the fourth quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner square footage increased 10.3% compared to the prior year, and we ended the fiscal year with a total of 5,954 Dollar Tree stores across North America, an increase of 587 stores this year. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive to business initiatives include category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. We're driving the business with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. We want our customers to know what season it is when they come in the front door. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In fourth quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 142 additional Dollar Tree stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,287 stores and growing. Our plan is to roll out freezers and coolers to 400 additional stores in 2016. We're on schedule with our planned conversions of our Deals store location. As we announced in October, we planned to dedicate our full energy and resources to our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. As planned, the rebannering of our 222 Deals stores commenced in January, and we're on track to complete this project on schedule. 
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest DC and Cherokee County, South Carolina is on schedule and on budget. This $1.5 million -- excuse me, 1.5 million square foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to begin shipping products from this new facility in July. To support continued growth in Western markets, we're expanding our Stockton, in California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is also scheduled to be completed by midyear. 
Turning to the Family Dollar banner, we continue to make meaningful progress on the Family Dollar integration. In the fourth quarter, Family Dollar stores completed the clearance of non-go forward product at the beginning of November and quickly moved to the impact of the holiday merchandise set. End caps were reclaimed for the holiday period and for the January promotional resets. Systems on hand are cleaner and our service levels continue to improve. Just over 2 quarters in, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked. We cleaned up old inventory and the end caps were more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. Regarding sales for the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. Same-store sales increased as the result of growth in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic leading the way. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables, with slightly higher sales growth in consumables. Sales were positive each month with the strongest sales increases in December. Geographically, comparable store sales at Family Dollar were strongest in the West and the mid-Atlantic. 
For the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 65 new Family Dollar stores and we relocated or expanded 42 Family Dollar stores for a total of 107 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we rebannered 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. We completed the required divestiture of 325 stores to Sycamore Partners at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We ended the fiscal year with 7,897 Family Dollar stores and a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,851 stores across North America. Just like Dollar Tree, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation. Merchants and stores are working hard to be first of the month ready and weekend ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, the role of private label products, while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic in-stock levels. Additionally, we're in the process of rolling out our smart ways to save program. The value elements of smart ways to save are a combination of everyday low price elements and items, strategically planned sales and price drop promotions, incredible $1 WOW! items and enhanced assortment of name brands, private label name brand equivalents and value brands. In order to earn back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visit, we're committed to improving the customer experience. There is a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions. We want them to be bright, clean and free of clutter. The customer experience full in-stock stores easy to shop, trusted value, focused on the merchandise relevance. We have to have what our customers need and want, and we're focused on customer engagement, friendly and informed associates. By identifying and establishing appropriate retailing disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. I am very pleased to report that recent results from our customer satisfaction surveys are showing meaningful improvement in fourth quarter versus prior year customer scores in each of our 4 primary survey categories, which are store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvements in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar becoming the neighborhood store of choice for our customer's shopping trips. We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics, with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement, while reducing cost, leveraging our shared services and back office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn, and we will invest prescriptively, while measuring return on our investments. As always, our P&L will continue to be managed line by line, quarter-by-quarter, with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our expectations. 
We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime cost of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in 4 primary areas: First of all, sourcing and procurement; second, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; third, distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but at this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12 months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact item match initiative to provide the lowest cost on identical items across both banners is complete with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues with outstanding result. There's more to come here. We're achieving planned savings from harmonizing of payment terms, auctions are a piece in a formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continue to grow and meet expectations. 
During the fourth quarter, we rebannered an additional 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, bringing our total of converted stores for fiscal 2015 to 205 stores. This slightly exceeded our target of 200 conversions for the year. The preliminary results are meeting expectations overall, and feedback from customers has been positive. We plan to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees in 2016 and our analysis will continue. Ultimately, our strategy is to have the right banner in the best location to serve our customers. We're finalizing the supply chain roadmap, and we'll soon be piloting our first co-banner distribution center. With a cross organizational functional team, we are integrating our warehouse management systems, and we're making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability and the merits of shipping both banners out of all facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Our first pilot facility in St. George, Utah, is planned to be operational before the third quarter. 
We continue to make progress on reducing costs through a shared services model. We're combining back office functions to support both banners through a shared services organization. Over time, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, indirect sourcing and procurement, real estate and construction, legal, strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost-effective approach. With less than a year into the integration, and we have made tremendous progress, we still have a great deal of work ahead of us. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long-term. It's a process. We're employing a well planned, thoughtful, low risk strategic approach that will benefit our long-term shareholders. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial performance and our initial outlook for 2016."

As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons are difficult. However, we have included tables with our press releases, which we believe will be helpful in better understanding the components of our business. Total sales for the fourth quarter grew 117% to $5.37 billion, which includes our second full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. Dollar Tree segment sales increased to 8.6% to $2.69 billion, while Family Dollar segment sales decreased 2.7% to $2.68 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by 205 rebannered stores and 325 divested stores. 
Same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7% versus a very strong 5.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.3%. All of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $734.5 million or 80% to $1.65 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the prior year's quarter. Majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $673.7 million. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 36.4% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.1% in the prior year's fourth quarter. Approximately 1/2 of the 70 basis point declined as a percent of sales was related to actual and accrued markdowns associated with the planned conversion of all Deals stores location. Other factors contributing to the year-over-year decline in gross margin rate was occupancy costs, higher distribution costs and shrink, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 25.2% during the fourth quarter compared with 25.1% in the comparable period -- prior year period. Including the $15.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 25.9% for the quarter. The improvement of 80 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark on and lower markdowns partially offset by higher occupancy costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 121% to $1.18 billion from $534.5 million in last year's fourth quarter.The majority of the $648.4 million increase related to $608.4 million of Family Dollar expense. Q4 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 21.4%, a 20 basis point as a percent to sales improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.3 million of acquisitions and integration-related costs, while the prior year included $6.7 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 21.2% for Q4 compared to 21.3% for the prior year's quarter. This 10 basis point improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs including retirement planned contributions and store bonuses, and was partially offset by higher operating corporate expenses, including legal fees and costs associated with the Deals store conversion. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 22.7% compared to 20.6% in the prior year's quarter. The current year included a $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization, $16 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, $8.9 million of severance costs and integration costs. The prior year's comparable period included $10.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 20.9% from 20.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation, repairs, professional fees and divestiture-related costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $17.4 million to $407.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 60 basis points to 15.2% compared to 15.8% of sales in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $1.9 million to $134.0 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the 205 rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 10 basis points to 5% compared to 4.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period. Non-operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $117.2 million and we're comprised primarily of net interest expense of $114.9 million in the quarter, which included an acceleration of $19 million in non-cash deferred financing costs associated with our prepayment of long-term debt of $1 billion in January. For the fourth quarter, the company had net income of $229 million or $0.97 per diluted share. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, as detailed in the press release tables, were $239.4 million and $1.01 per diluted share. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35% compared to 36.4% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attribute to an increase in the work opportunity tax credits in relation to the income for the fourth quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. 
Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $736.1 million compared to $864.1 million at the end of Q4, and as noted, we did make a $1 billion debt prepayment in late January. Our outstanding long-term debt is now approximately $7.5 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 18.9% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.7%. The primary contributors to the year-over-year increase in inventory levels relate to the West Coast port disruptions we experienced a year ago and earlier Easter in 2016 and an earlier Chinese new year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, end of year inventory on a selling square foot basis increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels of key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the first quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores, including 350 new Dollar Tree stores and 200 new Family Dollar Stores. The remodel -- relocation or expansion of approximately 200 stores, rebannering of approximately 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores and the rebanner of the 158 remaining Deals stores for a total of more than 1,000 store projects in 2016. In addition, we'll add frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores. We have IT system enhancements and integration projects. The completion of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center and the completion of our stock in California distribution center expansion. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $174.9 million for the fourth quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $16 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $54.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which were included in our guidance. First, it includes $8 million for Q1 and $5 million for Q2 depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the [indiscernible] accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q1 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
Turning to sales and earnings per share guidance. For modeling purposes, our initial outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions: As a reminder, at the begin of Q4 2015, we divested 325 Family Dollar stores that represent approximately $500 million in annual sales and $45.5 million in operating income. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebannered strategy analysis and our outlook for the same-store sales. We will continue our initiatives to rebanner stores. First, focusing on rebannering all Deals stores and then we plan to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Trees. Each will be 1 week earlier than the prior year. This represents an estimated $10 million headwind of sales. Inventory step-up amortization will be approximately $6 million in Q1 and $2 million in Q2. We are budgeting lower diesel fuel costs than a year ago with the first half providing the most benefit. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016, and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2016. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.6% for the first quarter and 36.8% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q1 and for the full year. 
For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion, and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.75 to $0.83. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 132%. Sales and earnings per share outlook for full fiscal year, we are forecasting total sales to range from $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $3.35 to $3.65. These estimates are based on a low single digit same- store sales increase and 4% sales square footage growth. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

I want to close by saying the strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is as compelling as ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers. While we are still in the early stages of the integration process, I am very pleased with our process and our progress. Gary Philbin and the leadership team at Family Dollar are working to plan effectively and efficiently. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the year 3. I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lower end costs both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I would tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
I'll close the prepared remarks by saying the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 32 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets, while serving more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store, every day. Our future has never been brighter.

Our values are better than ever, our stores are larger, they're -- more merchandise and more assortment than we've ever have. So there's no limitation to that. If you look at the fourth quarter largely, we're up against a very big fourth quarter last year, 5.6% comp and the year before. So basically, in sort of a tough economy, we were up against a fairly difficult comparison, 5.6%, and I think the 1.7 comp that you see is admirable considering what we faced with that comp last year. As to China, the sourcing continued to be strong and vibrant. We still import a lot of product. About 40% [ph] of our businesses is in product that we import and that continues our pricing out of China has been very positive. We've been able to not only improve values in our product by taking the lower cost and turning that into more value for the customer. But also, we've been able to reduce costs on the things that we buy every quarter, every year that we keep in our stores all the time.

And to the point, we've historically said we're competitive in the markets we're in and that's important because you have to be to get good employees at the end of the day. So I don't think that's really changed, but it is within the guidance. As you look at the synergies and you look at the costs achieved, obviously, we have an expectation that we will achieve synergies this year. There are synergies baked in, we haven't specifically said the dollars, and part of that is due to the timing is a little bit hard to nail specifically down. We're well on our way to meeting or beating the first year run rate of $75 million of synergies. So I think we've baked things in accordingly.

We started off, as you know, with an analysis of the stores that we thought could be better served -- better serve the customers as a Dollar Tree than a Family Dollar. And Family Dollars that were underperformance, frankly, because obviously, we can improve the performance of those Family Dollar stores by turning to a Dollar Tree, we would like to take a look at doing that. We modeled against really the Family Dollar -- the Dollar Tree model to come up with a large list and then we went through the process of reviewing those stores, actually, going out and sending people out to visit the sites and put their eyes on it as well as having the analysis. So from that is how we picked the first 200, 300 stores now. We'll continue the analysis. I would tell you that I haven't learned a whole lot different from what we first did in regard to and analyzing the Family Dollar stores again. They were underperforming Family Dollar stores that we put through the Dollar Tree real estate model. And from the Dollar Tree real estate model, we came with a sales projection. And from that, we knew what we could do, what we thought we can do as a Dollar Tree. So that's how we chose them. I don't think, it's really early. One of the reasons we're doing100 this year instead of maybe more is the fact that we would like to let the first 200 sort of burn in and have a few months. Some of them we have only had a few weeks on with results and most of us we don't have a few months. So with a little more time, then I think we'd probably find some more opportunity to improve that model and to improve the location and the rebannering project. But I will tell you, it is exciting. The rebannering is absolutely hitting our expectations of what we can deliver and, by the way, I think by running better stores, obviously, we can improve as we do in all Dollar Tree stores from opening to really going after the customer in those markets and running great stores for those neighborhoods."

All those moving pieces have an effect on the base. It is a little bit -- it's a lot to do for an organization.

I will tell you this -- there is really room -- has a lot of room in our operating margin to improve, and one of the things I'm most proud of is the sector leading operating margin and there's a few things that we can do to improve that, even though this sector leading. We can continue to grow that. We don't have to take away from it to invest in the customer. We can run our business better still. And it's driven by just a few factors. First of all, we got to improve our DC costs. By improving our DC costs, we'll be able to improve our operating margin. By improving our -- by the use of better staffing models and leveraging engineered standards, we can improve our DC costs. Our shrink is higher than it should be. It's grown over the last couple of years. We can improve that. We've always been able to run a very well managed shrink component in our business. And I expect that we're going to get back to better shrink number. Unfortunately, shrink, as you know, has a tail. Once you know it, you see it. Then all the initiatives that you do to bring it back in line sort of, don't show up until you cycle through some inventories in the life. But we're on top of it, and we can improve our shrink. We can also improve -- we'll leverage our occupancy with our comp store sales increases with that 32 straight quarters. Whether it's 2% or 3% or 4%, we'll will continue to leverage those fixed costs with our comp sales increase. Another big thing is by leveraging the combined companies, as an individual banner, 1 plus 1 does not equal 2 here. As we start bringing together our shared services for both banners, we're going to lower cost across both banners in the back office functions. So there's room for us to continue to grow our comp sales. There's room for us to continue to invest in our customer and be relevant and offer the best values in the business for $1 and at the same time, improve our operating margin."

We're currently, you've heard me reference St. George, Utah. We're currently working on combining and integrating the WMS systems. We're taking a Family Dollar banner DC in Saint George, Utah. And we're doing that right now. We'll start receiving some time April, May the Dollar Tree merchandise along with the Family Dollar merchandise, and we'll start shipping and testing that shortly after that. It's a plan. And of course, when we get that right and we have confidence and we can do that other places, then we'll begin rolling out and combining some others' DCs. As appropriate to do 2 things; one is to give us more capacity in the buildings that we own, whether it's Family Dollar that needs the capacity or Dollar Tree that needs capacity by being able to ship both banners out of any building will enable us to use the capacity better. And secondly, to improve the cost structure by rationalizing the DC network, getting the DCs in the right place and to serve the right banner. So that's some of the priorities that we have. We're going to keep merchandising separate. There's some of the back office things to do with merchandising. We'll try to leverage, but Family Dollar buyers are going to be buying using Family Dollar systems and Dollar Tree like -- using the Dollar Tree systems as far as retail purchasing right now, where we're going to combine some of the back office things and leverage our international sourcing, leveraging [indiscernible] both banners, leveraging our international organization across both banners, our QA, QC, all of those things will be leveraging.

So merchandise is merchandise, but when you look at all those services and goods that we buy as organizations, being able to leverage that across both organizations, streamline processes, determine the best way to go forward for both banners is really very exciting and very powerful. So that by far, is the biggest bucket. The second biggest bucket that we spoke to in the past is the rebannering process and taking underperforming stores and turning them into stores that are performing at a higher level, at an average Dollar Tree rate. So that's the second one. The third and fourth buckets are smaller. We've always said that the distribution and logistics has a chance to be a big number, but it's a longer-term project. So to Bob's point, when he was speaking to the work being done today looking at systems and how you ship both banners out of one distribution center that potentially has some big payback, but it is a little further down the road.

On a lower comp, we don't get as much leverage on occupancy and distribution as we normally would. And again, to the point of what we're trying to do there, and as Bob speaking to, we know we can do better from a distribution standpoint and then shrink being the other item, which we are not happy with our performance this year and we've obviously got teams focused on that. But that was a headwind. What was really positive within the day was the fact that our merchandise costs continue to be better. The mark on was up and so we're buying better, freight was a benefit. So a lot of things going really well there, and that's very positive and we'll continue to be positive, we believe, as we go forward. I think the other thing I would say about the Dollar Tree business is even on a lower comp for the quarter or even the year, we are able to leverage our SG&A expenses. So to me, that's very powerful to the model. There's a lot of companies who would not be able to leverage their SG&A at this type of a comp level, so, again, it's part of our disciplined approach as we go forward. I think speaking to the Family Dollar business, I think in general, I think the gross profit came in about where we thought it would. I think we have made some good strides with the team there working to, again, a lot of work being down to make sure we get some of the best net debt cost that we can in the system and be able to track that and base our business off of that, so I think that's very positive. I think as we spoke to in the prepared remarks, some of the headwinds as far from comparability standpoint relate to incentive compensation, divestiture costs and some things like that. So overall, I don't know that there were a lot of big surprises. Obviously, if sales maybe would have been more towards -- the good thing is sales were at the middle of the range, earnings were at the top end, [indiscernible] top end of the range, but I think the flow through is actually pretty good at the end of the day.

So starting with that, I would say, that's where we're grounded. But part of the synergy effort is having our merchants sit together. And just got back from our most recent trip in China, where both our Family Dollar and Dollar Tree merchants are able to sit in the same room and take a look at items. So that's going to be a piece trip after trip where our merchants can sit in the same room and find the things that fit for Family Dollar that for us means opening price points, great value, items that can be imported that are private brands. All those things are going to take shape as we continue iterations of our merchants staying together. So there's going to be some items that you might see in both banners, but if you ever go into a Dollar Tree or Family Dollar and mistake one for the other, we really missed the mark on that assortment. You're going to see 2 compelling stores and assortments, and quite frankly, even on the real estate side, where they live, which really is the growth curve for both banners as we go forward. So I hope that helps."

I tell our folks we have 12 holidays a year, it's called 1st of month, so we're spending a lot of energy at Family Dollar making sure that our stores are ready, the investment that we want to make with our customer is really a kickoff around that time of the month. Focusing money in their pocket to spend and we want to be right. So all of the things that we have been working on, getting the non-go forward inventory cleared down to get on hands better, so that we can have our shelves better stocked. That's the effort we've made up to this point to go into the springtime. Obviously, we got Easter holiday ahead of us going into a season that is obviously spring and summer after that. But I would tell you an awful lot of what we're working on is delivering the basics everyday, which our customer research says they'll give us credit for that if we're able to deliver on that, week in, week out, month in, month out. As far as promotional strategy, you might see we introduced smart ways to save, which really for me is a way of tying together what our customers are going to see. Our ads will reflect our stores. And so when you think about how you are to say about Family Dollar, our customers are giving us credit now for every day low price. Of course, we have always had traffic drivers on our sale items. The company even before we bought on, certainly had over 1,000 $1 WOW! items in the store that customers love to shop. We have an extensive private brands program that certainly is under [indiscernible] and what we're introducing us price drop which is nothing new compared to other retailers, but for us, it is a way of delivering value to our customers and some of the items they shop most often. And so it's another arrow in our quiver that allows us to deliver value to our customers on a monthly basis and surely a way of showing from the ad to the store to even how we think about our customer shopping patterns, how we come into a Family Dollar shopping. So we think it is an exciting kickoff and really gives our merchants and really great support from our vendor community. Another way to drive more incremental cases at Family Dollar."

This morning, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015. Total sales for the quarter increased to $5.37 billion, and same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%. Total sales for fiscal 2015, which included nearly 7 months of Family Dollar sales, were $15.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $229 million and adjusted net income was $239.4 million, near the high end of our range of guidance. EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.01. I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the fourth quarter. Sales were solid and at the midpoint of our range of guidance. SG&A expenses were leveraged and well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector-leading operating margins, and earnings were very near the top of our guidance. Our customer base is large and it's growing and we continue to meet our milestones and remain on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have truly an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization, and the strategic rationale for the combination continues to be as compelling as ever. In the early stages of integration, there have been no surprises that diminish our vision and plans for value creation. In fact, as we improve retail operations, there is increased enthusiasm for the opportunity to grow and to serve more customers in more ways as a combined company. We have confidence in our disciplined approach to continue improving the customer experience at Family Dollar and in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real time, our eyes are on the horizon as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
Only 2 quarters into the integration, our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating effectively to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the fourth quarter were numerous, including another solid quarter for our Dollar Tree banner. As expected, Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit same-store sales increase. Same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7%, and that was on top of a strong 5.6% increase in the fourth quarter a year ago. Same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products, and sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories include party supplies, beauty and eyewear, snacks and beverage and candy and food. Geographically, Dollar Tree's same-store sales growth was strongest in the Northeast and Midwest. 
I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was the 32nd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. That's 32 straight quarters, 8 straight years of comp growth and everything is still a dollar. Cycling comps are 5.6% last year and through a difficult consumer environment, fourth quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often, and we're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our customer -- our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchant teams do a tremendous job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the fourth quarter. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
As we entered the fourth quarter, store presentations boldly communicated the message to our customers that Dollar Tree was the go-to store for basics and your holiday needs. In early November, we focused on first of the month basic consumables and Thanksgiving-related foods like chicken broth and vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care of customer needs related to holiday meals, with baking basics, mixing bowls, foil pans, turkey basters and food storage containers. And we addressed the customers' needs related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers. Our home for the holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods; like cookies and mints and party mix, and everything was just $1. Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a swift transition to Christmas holiday decorations, Toyland and great gift ideas. And the merchant at stores continued to build on our Last 10 Days strategy by bringing all of the last minute categories together and remerchandising the front of the store with a purpose. Our goal was to be the gift supply headquarters for items like holiday tins, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. Our customers understand that if you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree is the store for you. If you're buying your wrap and supplies anywhere else, you're paying too much. 
In addition to our seasonal energy, customers continued to look at Dollar Tree for their basic needs. Throughout the quarter, our stores continued to highlight and promote our million dollar brands. These are brands that they know and trust like Pringles, Nabisco, Scotties, Crest Toothpaste and many more. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 63 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 11 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 58 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores and we rebannered 52 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 184 Dollar Tree projects during the fourth quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner square footage increased 10.3% compared to the prior year, and we ended the fiscal year with a total of 5,954 Dollar Tree stores across North America, an increase of 587 stores this year. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive the business initiatives include category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. We're driving the business with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. We want our customers to know what season it is when they come in the front door. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In fourth quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 142 additional Dollar Tree stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,287 stores and growing. Our plan is to roll out freezers and coolers to 400 additional stores in 2016. We're on schedule with our planned conversions of our Deals store locations. As we announced in October, we plan to dedicate our full energy and resources to our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. As planned, the rebannering of our 222 Deals stores commenced in January, and we're on track to complete this project on schedule. 
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest DC in Cherokee County, South Carolina is on schedule and on budget. This $1.5 million -- excuse me, 1.5 million square foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to begin shipping products from this new facility in July. To support continued growth in western markets, we're expanding our Stockton, California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is also scheduled to be completed by midyear. 
Turning to the Family Dollar banner, we continued to make meaningful progress on the Family Dollar integration. In the fourth quarter, Family Dollar stores completed the clearance of non-go-forward product at the beginning of November and quickly moved to the impact of the holiday merchandise set. End caps were reclaimed for the holiday period and for the January promotional resets. Systems on-hands are cleaner and our service levels continued to improve. Just over 2 quarters in, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked, we had cleaned up old inventory and the end caps were more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. Regarding sales for the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. Same-store sales increased as the result of growth in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic leading the way. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables, with slightly higher sales growth in consumables. Sales were positive each month, with the strongest sales increases in December. Geographically, comparable store sales at Family Dollar were strongest in the West and the mid-Atlantic. 
For the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 65 new Family Dollar stores, and we relocated or expanded 42 Family Dollar stores for a total of 107 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we rebannered 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. We completed the required divestiture of 325 stores to Sycamore Partners at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We ended the fiscal year with 7,897 Family Dollar stores and a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,851 stores across North America. Just like Dollar Tree, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation. Merchants and stores are working hard to be first-of-the-month ready and weekend ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, the role of private label products, while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic in-stock levels. Additionally, we're in the process of rolling out our smart ways to save program. The value elements of smart ways to save are a combination of everyday low price elements and items, strategically planned sales and price drop promotions, incredible $1 WOW! items and an enhanced assortment of name brands, private label name brand equivalents and value brands. In order to earn back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visit, we're committed to improving the customer experience. There is a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions. We want them to be bright, clean and free of clutter. The customer experience: full, in-stock stores, easy to shop, trusted value. Focus on the merchandise relevance: we have to have what our customers need and want. And we're focused on customer engagement: friendly and informed associates. By identifying and establishing appropriate retailing disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. I am very pleased to report that recent results from our customer satisfaction surveys are showing meaningful improvement in fourth quarter versus prior year customer scores in each of our 4 primary survey categories, which are store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvements in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar becoming the neighborhood store of choice for our customers' shopping trips. We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics, with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement, while reducing costs, leveraging our shared services and back office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn, and we will invest prescriptively, while measuring return on our investments. As always, our P&L will continue to be managed line by line, quarter-by-quarter, with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our expectations. 
We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime costs of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in 4 primary areas: First of all, sourcing and procurement; second, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; third, distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but at this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12 months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact item match initiative to provide the lowest cost on identical items across both banners is complete, with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues with outstanding results. There's more to come here. We're achieving planned savings from harmonizing of payment terms, auctions, RFPs and a formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continue to grow and meet expectations. 
During the fourth quarter, we rebannered an additional 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, bringing our total of converted stores for fiscal 2015 to 205 stores. This slightly exceeded our target of 200 conversions for the year. The preliminary results are meeting expectations overall, and feedback from customers has been positive. We have plans to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees in 2016, and our analysis will continue. Ultimately, our strategy is to have the right banner in the best location to serve our customers. We're finalizing the supply chain road map, and we'll soon be piloting our first co-bannered distribution center. With a cross organizational functional team, we are integrating our warehouse management systems, and we're making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability and the merits of shipping both banners out of all facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Our first pilot facility, in St. George, Utah, is planned to be operational before the third quarter. 
We continue to make progress on reducing costs through a shared services model. We're combining back office functions to support both banners through a shared services organization. Over time, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, indirect sourcing and procurement, real estate and construction, legal, strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost-effective approach. We're less than a year into the integration, and we've made tremendous progress, but we still have a great deal of work ahead of us. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It's a process. We're employing a well-planned, thoughtful, low-risk strategic approach that will benefit our long-term shareholders. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial performance and our initial outlook for 2016."

As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons are difficult. However, we have included tables with our press release, which we believe will be helpful in better understanding the components of our business. Total sales for the fourth quarter grew 117% to $5.37 billion, which includes our second full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.6% to $2.69 billion, while Family Dollar segment sales decreased 2.7% to $2.68 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by 205 rebannered stores and 325 divested stores. 
Same-store sales on a constant-currency basis increased 1.7% versus a very strong 5.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.3%. All of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $734.5 million or 80% to $1.65 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the prior year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $673.7 million. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 36.4% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.1% in the prior year's fourth quarter. Approximately 1/2 of the 70 basis point declined as a percent of sales was related to actual accrued markdowns associated with the planned conversion of all Deals stores locations. Other factors contributing to the year-over-year decline in gross margin rate was occupancy costs, higher distribution costs and shrink, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 25.2% during the fourth quarter compared with 25.1% in the comparable period -- prior year period. Including the $15.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 25.9% for the quarter. The improvement of 80 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on and lower markdowns partially offset by higher occupancy costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 121% to $1.18 billion from $534.5 million in last year's fourth quarter.The majority of the $648.4 million increase related to $608.4 million of Family Dollar expense. Q4 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 21.4%, a 20 basis point as a percent to sales improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.3 million of acquisition and integration-related costs, while the prior year included $6.7 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 21.2% for Q4 compared to 21.3% for the prior year's quarter. This 10 basis point improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs including retirement plan contributions and store bonuses, and was partially offset by higher operating corporate expenses, including legal fees and costs associated with the Deals store conversion. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 22.7% compared to 20.6% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization, $16 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, $8.9 million of severance costs and integration costs. The prior year's comparable period includes $10.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 20.9% from 20.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation, repairs, professional fees and divestiture-related costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $17.4 million to $407.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 60 basis points to 15.2% compared to 15.8% of sales in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $1.9 million to $134.0 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by 205 rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 10 basis points to 5% compared to 4.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period. Non-operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $117.2 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $114.9 million in the quarter, which included an acceleration of $19 million in non-cash deferred financing costs associated with our prepayment of long-term debt of $1 billion in January. For the fourth quarter, the company had net income of $229 million or $0.97 per diluted share. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, as detailed in the press release tables, were $239.4 million and $1.01 per diluted share. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35% compared to 36.4% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in the work opportunity tax credits in relation to the income for the fourth quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. 
Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $736.1 million compared to $864.1 million at the end of Q4, and as noted, we did make a $1 billion debt prepayment in late January. Our outstanding long-term debt is now approximately $7.5 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 18.9% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.7%. The primary contributors to the year-over-year increase in inventory levels relate to the West Coast port disruptions we experienced a year ago, an earlier Easter in 2016 and an earlier Chinese new year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, end of year inventory on a selling square foot basis increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels of key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the first quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores, including 350 new Dollar Tree stores and 200 new Family Dollar Stores; the remodel, relocation or expansion of approximately 200 stores; the rebannering of approximately 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores; and the rebanner of the 158 remaining Deals stores, for a total of more than 1,000 store projects in 2016. In addition, we'll add frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores. We have IT system enhancements and integration projects. The completion of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center and the completion of our Stockton, California distribution center expansion. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $174.9 million for the fourth quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $16 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $54.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $8 million for Q1 and $5 million for Q2 depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q1 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
Turning to sales and earnings per share guidance. For modeling purposes, our initial outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions. As a reminder, at the begin of Q4 2015, we divested 325 Family Dollar stores that represented approximately $500 million in annual sales and $45.5 million in operating income. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebannered strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We will continue our initiatives to rebanner stores, first focusing on rebannering all Deals stores and then we plan to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Trees. Easter will be one week earlier than the prior year. This represents an estimated $10 million headwind to sales. Inventory step-up amortization will be approximately $6 million in Q1 and $2 million in Q2. 
We are budgeting lower diesel fuel costs than a year ago, with the first half providing the most benefit. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016, and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2016. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.6% for the first quarter and 36.8% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q1 and for the full year. 
For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion, and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.75 to $0.83. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 132%. Sales and earnings per share outlook for the full fiscal year, we are forecasting total sales to range from $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $3.35 to $3.65. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 4% sales square footage growth.

I want to close by saying the strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is as compelling as ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers. While we are still in the early stages of the integration process, I am very pleased with our process and our progress. Gary Philbin and the leadership team at Family Dollar are working the plan effectively and efficiently. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lower end costs from both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I will tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
I will close the prepared remarks by saying the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 32 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets, while serving more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store, every day. Our future has never been brighter.

To the first part of the question, we're not limited by the merchandise assortment or the price point. We have more assortment than ever. Our values are better than ever, our stores are larger, they're -- more merchandise and more assortment than we've ever had. So there's no limitation to that. If you look at the fourth quarter largely, we're up against a very big fourth quarter last year, 5.6% comp, and the year before. So basically, in sort of a tough economy, we are up against a fairly difficult comparison, 5.6%, and I think the 1.7% comp that you see is admirable considering what we faced with that comp last year. As to China, our sourcing continues to be strong and vibrant. We still import a lot of product. About 40% of our business is in product that we import, and that continues. Our pricing out of China has been very positive. We've been able to not only improve values in our product by taking the lower costs and turning that into more value for the customer, but also, we've been able to reduce costs on things that we buy every quarter, every year that we keep in our stores all the time. So the basics, we've been able to reduce costs on that, especially on the last trip. You had a follow-up question?"

And to the point, we've historically said we're competitive in the markets we're in and that's important because you have to be to get good employees at the end of the day. So I don't think that's really changed, but it is within the guidance. As you look at the synergies and you look at the costs achieved, obviously, we have an expectation that we will achieve synergies this year. There are synergies baked in, we haven't specifically said the dollars, and part of that is due to the timing is a little bit hard to nail specifically down. We are well on our way to meeting or beating the first year run rate of $75 million of synergies. So I think we've baked things in accordingly.

And Family Dollars that were underperforming, frankly, because obviously, we can improve the performance of those Family Dollar stores by turning them into a Dollar Tree. We're going to -- we'd like to take a look at doing that. We modeled against really the Family Dollar -- the Dollar Tree model to come up with a large list, and then we went through the process of reviewing those stores, actually, going out and sending people out to visit the sites and put their eyes on it as well as having the analysis. So from that is how we picked the first 200, 300 stores now. We'll continue the analysis. I will tell you that we haven't learned a whole lot different from what we first did in regard to analyzing the Family Dollar stores. Again, they were underperforming Family Dollar stores that we put through the Dollar Tree real estate model. And from the Dollar Tree real estate model, we came up with a sales projection. And from that, we knew what we could do, what we thought we can do as a Dollar Tree. So that's how we chose them. I don't think there's -- it's really early. One of the reasons we're doing 100 this year instead of maybe more is the fact that we would like to let the first 200 sort of burn in and have a few months. Some of them we've only had a few weeks on with results, and at most we've only had a few months. So with a little more time, then I think we will probably find some more opportunity to improve that model and to improve the location and the rebannering project. But I will tell you, it's exciting. The rebannering is absolutely hitting our expectations of what we can deliver, and, by the way, I think by running better stores then obviously we can improve, as we do in all Dollar Tree stores, from opening to really going after the customer in those markets and running great stores for those neighborhoods."

There's always -- there always are things we can do by expanding categories that are growing, by pulling back on categories that are declining, by increasing the value. The idea of buying better with a combined larger company and leveraging the power of our pencil to buy better, to distribute goods better, the logistics costs, we ought to be able to leverage those for both banners and provide more efficient and better supply of merchandise to our stores. So I mean, model as you wish, but for the long haul, I believe that our Dollar Tree business is going to remain vibrant for years to come."

Other retailers will raise or lower their prices. At Dollar Tree, we change the product. We'll either improve the value or take a little more in margins. So we'll continue to do that. I will tell you this, though, there's really room -- there's a lot of room in our operating margin to improve it, and one of the things I'm most proud of is the sector leading operating margin, and there's a few things that we can do to improve that, even though it's sector leading. We can continue to grow that. We don't have to take away from it to invest in the customer. We can run our business better still. And it's driven by just a few factors. First of all, we've got to improve our DC costs. By improving our DC costs, we'll be able to improve our operating margin. By improving our -- by the use of better staffing models and leveraging engineered standards, we can improve our DC costs. Our shrink is higher than it should be. It's grown over the last couple of years. We can improve that. We've always been able to run a very well-managed shrink component in our business. And I expect that we're going to get back to a better shrink number. Unfortunately, shrink, as you know, has a tail. Once you know it and see it, then all of the initiatives that you do to bring it back in line sort of don't show up until you cycle through some inventories and the like. But we're on top of it, and we can improve our shrink. We can also improve our -- we'll leverage our occupancy with our comp store sales increases. We've had 32 straight quarters. Whether it's 2% or 3% or 4%, we'll will continue to leverage those fixed costs with our comp sales increase. And then another big thing is by leveraging the combined companies, as an individual banner, 1 plus 1 doesn't equal 2 here. As we start bringing together our shared services for both banners, we're going to lower costs across both banners in the back office functions. So there's room for us to continue to grow our comp sales. There's room for us to continue to invest in our customer and be relevant and offer the best values in the business for $1 and at the same time, improve our operating margin."

We're doing a lot of work around what -- bringing together shared services as a priority, being able to, for example, get everyone on the same financial system so that we can pay all the bills the same way using the same system. We're currently, you've heard me reference St. George, Utah. We're currently working on combining and integrating the WMS systems. We're taking a Family Dollar bannered DC in Saint George, Utah, and we're doing that right now. We'll start receiving some time April, May, the Dollar Tree merchandise along with the Family Dollar merchandise, and we'll start shipping and testing that shortly after that is the plan. And of course, when we get that right and we have confidence that we can do that other places, then we'll begin rolling out and combining some others, DCs as appropriate, to do 2 things. One is to give us more capacity in the buildings that we own, whether it's Family Dollar that needs the capacity or Dollar Tree that needs the capacity, by being able to ship both banners out of any building will enable us to use the capacity better. And secondly, to improve the cost structure by rationalizing the DC network, getting the DCs in the right places to serve the right banner. So that's some of the priorities that we have. We're going to keep the merchandising separate. There's some of the back office things to do with merchandising we'll try to leverage, but Family Dollar buyers are going to be buying using Family Dollar systems and Dollar Tree alike, using the Dollar Tree systems, as far as retail purchasing right now. We're going to combine some of the back office things and leverage our international sourcing, leveraging freights across both banners, leveraging our international organization across both banners, our QA, QC, all of those things we'll be leveraging. So that sort of gives you a color. There is a road map for the entire network, system by system, and it spans the next 3 years, with the most important things to get -- to glean the most value the earliest at the front end."

So that's where the -- that's very -- it's a wide net, as you might imagine, not only when you think about all the things we buy. So merchandise is merchandise, but when you look at all the services and goods that we buy as organizations, being able to leverage that across both organizations, streamline processes, determine the best way to go forward for both banners is really very exciting and very powerful. So that by far, is the biggest bucket. The second biggest bucket that we spoke to in the past is the rebannering process and taking underperforming stores and turning them into stores that are performing at a higher level, at an average Dollar Tree rate. So that's the second one. And the third and fourth buckets are smaller. We've always said that the distribution and logistics has a chance to be a big number, but it's a longer-term project. So to Bob's point when he was speaking to the work being done today on looking at systems and how you ship both banners out of one distribution center, that potentially has some big payback, but it's a little further down the road. So that's kind of directionally how to think about it."

On a lower comp, we don't get as much leverage on occupancy and distribution as we normally would. And again, to the point of what we're trying to do there, and as to Bob speaking to it, we know we can do better from a distribution standpoint. And then shrink being the other item, which we're not happy with our performance this year, and we've obviously got teams focused on that. But that was a headwind. What was really positive at the end of the day was the fact that our merchandise costs continued to be better. The mark-on was up, so we're buying better. Freight was a benefit. So a lot of things going really well there, and that's very positive and will continue to be positive, we believe, as we go forward. I think the other thing I would say about the Dollar Tree business is even on a lower comp for the quarter and even the year, we were able to leverage our SG&A expenses. So to me, that's very powerful to the model. There's a lot of companies that would not be able to leverage their SG&A at this type of a comp level, so, again, it's part of our disciplined approach as we go forward. I think speaking to the Family Dollar business, I think in general, I think the gross profit came in about where we thought it would. I think we've made some good strides,  the team there working to, again, a lot of work being done to make sure we get the -- some of the best net debt costs that we can in the system and be able to track that and base our business off of that, so I think that's very positive. I think as we spoke to in the prepared remarks, some of the headwinds as far from a comparability standpoint relate to incentive compensation, divestiture costs and some things like that. So overall, I don't know that there were a lot of big surprises. Obviously, if sales maybe would have been more towards the -- the good thing is sales were at the middle of the range, earnings were at the top end, towards the top end of the range, but I think with the flow through was actually pretty good at the end of the day. So I think that's how we think about it."

Let me start by maybe just describing -- one of the reasons we did the acquisition was to have 2 compelling banners. So this is not an exercise to turn Family Dollar into Dollar Tree, and so we are rooted in the customers we serve and where we serve them. I like to make sure we're very clear. We're going to have a very productive Family Dollar banner with compelling assortments that we think fit the bill for the folks that shop us, and that revolves an awful lot around first-of-month and delivery basics and giving them items that, on a discretionary basis, they need to round out their shopping trip. So starting with that, I would say that's where we're grounded. But part of the synergy effort is having our merchants sit together. And I just got back from our most recent trip in China, where both our Family Dollar and Dollar Tree merchants are able to sit in the same room and take a look at items. And so that's going to be a piece that trip after trip where our merchants can sit in the same room and find the things that fit for Family Dollar that for us means opening price point, great value, items that can be imported that are private brands. All those things are going to take shape as we continue the iterations of our merchants getting together. So there's going to be some items that you might see in both banners, but if you ever go into a Dollar Tree or a Family Dollar and mistake one for the other, we've really missed the mark on that assortment. You're going to see 2 compelling stores and assortments, and quite frankly, even on the real estate side, where they live, which really is a growth curve for both banners as we go forward. So I hope that helps."

So all of the things that we've been working on, getting the non-go-forward inventory cleared down to get our on-hands better so that we can have our shelves better stocked, that's the effort we've made up to this point to go into this springtime. Obviously, we've got the Easter holiday ahead of us, going into a season that is obviously spring and summer after that. But I would tell you an awful lot of what we're working on is delivering the basics everyday, which our customer research says they'll give us credit for that if we're able to deliver on that, week in, week out, month in, month out. As far as promotional strategy, you might see we introduced smart ways to save, which really for me is a way of tying together what our customers are going to see. Our ads will reflect our stores. And so when you think about how you ought to save at a Family Dollar, our customers are giving us credit now for our everyday low price. Of course, we've have always had traffic drivers on our sale items. The company even before we bought them, certainly had over 1,000 $1 WOW! items in the store that customers love to shop. We have an extensive private brands program that certainly lends itself to compare and save, and what we're introducing as price drop, which is nothing new compared to other retailers, but for us, it's a way of delivering value to our customers on some of the items they shop most often. And so it's another arrow in our quiver that allows us to deliver value to our customers on a monthly basis, and surely a way of showing from ad to the store to even how we think about our customers' shopping patterns, how they ought to come into a Family Dollar and shop it. So we think it's an exciting kickoff, and really gives our merchants and really with great support from our vendor community, another way to drive more incremental cases at Family Dollar."

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%,",2208,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. 
This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.2%.
Total sales results were at the mid-point of our range of guidance. Operating income increased 80% to $418.7 million. Net income for the quarter increased 235% to $232.7 million, and earnings per share increased 188% to $0.98, which exceeded the high end of our first quarter range of guidance by $0.15.
I'm very pleased with our company's accomplishments for the first quarter. Sales were solidly within our range of guidance. SG&A expenses across both banners were well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8% for the quarter. And our Family Dollar segment first quarter operating margin improved to 5.1%. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.98 were $0.15 above the top end of our range of guidance. Excluding a $0.09 benefit from our lower-than-planned tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share were $0.89, which exceeded the top end of our range of guidance by $0.06 per share. 
Looking ahead, we have an incredible opportunity to increase shareholder value as a combined organization. Our integration of Family Dollar is on schedule, and the strategic rationale for the combination is as compelling as ever. As progress on our retail operation continues, there's an increased enthusiasm for the opportunity this merger presents to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways.
We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real-time, we are developing the foundation for our larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
Accomplishments continued to grow in the first quarter. In the Dollar Tree segment, sales increased 9.5%, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%. Sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products and through increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories included household products, candy and food, snacks and beverage and party supplies. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Mid-Atlantic, followed closely by the Midwest and the Northeast. 
I'm pleased with the consistent growth and the strength of the Dollar Tree business. This represented our 33rd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Cycling comps up 3.4% last year and through a volatile period for retail, our first quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they work hard to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store everyday. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the first quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons, party supplies and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and to Easter.
The red seasonal displays for February quickly turned green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies in preparation for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, fashion accessories, chocolate candy, baskets and basket stoppers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids.
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in the first quarter, our 30-year anniversary event emphasized unbelievable values on many namebrand Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. Tremendous values and all priced as it has been for the past 30 years at just $1 per item. 
And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million-dollar brands with signing and special displays of these everyday items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for Mother's Day, Memorial Day and Summer Fun.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the first quarter, we opened a total of 112 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 25 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 126 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores. And we rebannered 3 Family Dollars to Dollar Stores for a total 266 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. 
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% compared to the prior year, and we ended the first quarter with a total of 6,049 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I am pleased to report that since quarter end, we have successfully completed the rebannering of all of our Deal$ stores. As a reminder, 210 Deal$ stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores, 9 were converted to Family Dollar stores and 3 we're closing as their lease term expired. Going forward, all of our resources and efforts will be dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our Drive the Business initiatives include: number one, category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize, expand assortments and pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. Number two, a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Number three, creating merchandise synergies and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And number four, being first of the month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers shopping for basic needs.
We're expanding our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 118 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,405 stores and growing. Our plan is to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016.
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and appropriate distribution capacity ahead of the need. I'm pleased to announce that construction on our newest DC, that would be Dollar Tree DC number 11 in Cherokee County, South Carolina, was completed on schedule and on budget. This 1.5 million-square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We are currently receiving product at this facility and will begin shipping to stores from this new facility this quarter. 
Additionally, to support continued growth in Western markets, we are expanding our Stockton, California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet. This project is nearing completion.
And we're making meaningful progress in the Family Dollar banner. Less than 1 year into our integration, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stopped, we've cleaned up old inventory and the in capture more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. 
For the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. Same-store sales increased was driven by increased traffic, partially offset by slight decline in average ticket. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables at the Family Dollar banner with slightly higher comp sales growth in discretionary. 
The strongest sales increases by month were in February and March, reflecting the Easter shift. Geographically, comp store growth was led by the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 
For the first quarter, Family Dollar, we opened a total of 59 new Family Dollar stores, and we relocated or expanded 41 Family Dollar stores for a total of 100 projects. During the quarter, we rebannered Family Dollar stores -- 3 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 6 others we're in the process of conversion at quarter end. Additionally, 9 Deal$ store locations were converted to Family Dollars. We ended the first quarter with 7,948 Family Dollar stores. 
We're well on our way to achieving our announced Family Dollar store growth of 200 new stores in 2016. 
At quarter end, we had a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,997 stores across North America.
As in Dollar Tree stores, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and value creation. Merchants and stores are working hard to the first of the month ready and weekend-ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing and the role of private label products while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic and stock levels. We're pleased with the initial reception and the traction we're gaining with the Smart Ways to Save initiatives. Our goal is to communicate value to our customers. The key elements of Smart Ways to Save are a combination of everyday low-price items, strategic planned sales and price drop motions, incredible $1 wow items and a continually enhanced assortment of namebrands, private label, named brand equivalents and value brands. We're pleased with the Family Dollar traffic trends we experienced in Q1. To win back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visits, we're committed to improving their shopping experience.
There's a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions, where we aspire to offer the shopping experience that is bright, clean and free of clutter. There's a keen focus on the customer experience with a store that is full in stock, easy to shop, full of product that is a trusted value. There's a focus on merchandise relevance. In the words of the customer, ""my Family Dollar has what I need."" There's a focus on customer engagement from friendly and informed associates. Importantly, not all of the table stakes initiatives require investment and expense or capital. By identifying and establishing winning retail disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. Our customer satisfaction surveys continue to reflect improvements in customer scores in each of our 4 primary service categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvement in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar reestablishing itself as the convenience store of choice for our customer shopping trips. 
We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement while reducing costs, leveraging shared service and back-office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn, and we will invest prescriptively while measuring return on our investments. And as always, our P&L will continue to be managed line-by-line, quarter-by-quarter with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our updated expectation. 
Some comments on achieving synergies and delivering great values. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year postclosing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime costs of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in 4 primary areas: one, sourcing and procurement; two, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; three distribution and logistics; and four, overhead and corporate SG&A. At this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12 months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for the second quarter and for the full year 2016."

Total sales for the first quarter grew 134% to $5.09 billion, which includes our third full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the mid-point of the sales guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion. 
Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 9.5% to $2.38 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 1.8% to $2.70 billion. 
Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by rebannered stores and divested stores.
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3% versus 3.4% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.2%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deal$ stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 108% to $1.55 billion through the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $805.7 million increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $733.8 million. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.6% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.4% during the first quarter, flat compared with the prior year's first quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included: Lower merchandise costs due to favorable of freight cost; higher shrink as a result of unfavorable physical inventory results; higher distribution costs as a percentage of net sales; and cycling a onetime, $2 million, noncash charge from the prior year related to a change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 27.2% during the first quarter compared with 25.8% in the comparable period last prior year. Excluding the $6.3 million of inventory step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 27.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 160 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on, favorable freight costs and improved shrink, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 120% to $1.14 billion from $516.1 million in last year's first quarter. The majority of the $619.8 million increase related to $595.8 million in Family Dollar expense. 
Q1 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 22.6%, a 110 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $10.4 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's costs, SG&A improved 60 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.2% of sales for the prior year's quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs, including lower incentive compensation, health insurance and profit-sharing expense; and improved store opening costs as a percentage of sales related to lower utility costs. 
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 22.1% compared to 20.8% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.1% from 20.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased payroll and incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $37.5 million to $280.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income improved 60 basis points to 11.8% compared to 11.2% of sales in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $24.8 million to $170.9 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar Stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 100 basis points to 6.3% compared to 5.3% of sales in the prior year's comparable period.
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.1 million comprised primarily of net interest expense of $87.3 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29.8% compared to 38.6% in the prior year's quarter. Our Q1 guidance was based on an expected tax rate of 36.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime benefit of state tax expense related to the fair market value of assets acquired from Family Dollar, in addition, a tax benefit from adopting a ASU number 2016-09 related to stock compensation accounting and an increase in work opportunity tax credit in relation to income for the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company had net income of $232.7 million [ph] or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes an approximate $0.09 benefit to Q1 EPS from the lower-than-anticipated tax rate. Excluding this onetime tax benefit and the prior year quarter acquisition-related costs, diluted EPS improved by 25.4% to $0.89 from $0.71.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $929.7 million compared to $736.1 million at the end of 2015. Our outstanding long-term debt is approximately $7.5 billion.
Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 18.4% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling-square-foot increased 7.2%. The primary contributor to the year-over-year increases in inventory levels relates to the West Coast port disruptions we experienced a year ago. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end increased 2.2% over the same period last year, increased 5.9% on a per selling-square-foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $175.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $66.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores or remodels, including 3 development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capabilities to appropriate 400 Dollar Tree Stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $162.3 million in the first quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortize and $7.8 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $52.8 million in the first quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the store run rate of depreciation, amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $5 million for Q2 and $13 million for fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounted policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. 
Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q2 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions: our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into our rebanner strategy analysis in our outlook for same-store sales. 
Remaining inventory step-up amortization will be approximately $2 million in Q2. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016. We do not anticipate any share repurchase in 2016, and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations as we have not adjusted our guidance for change in the currency rates.
Please note that our fiscal 2016 outlook does not include any adjustments related to the recent FLSA announcement regarding changes to overtime regulation. The rule change affects a relatively small percentage of our workforce, and our store associates are competitively compensated. We continue to analyze the role changes we put our action plans together throughout these changes. As always, we review cost pressures as a variable in our business that we are responsible to manage. Although still early in the analysis revised overtime regulations, as of now, our best current estimate is the potential impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter based on the December 1, 2016 implementation date. 
We will update this information as applicable, as we continue to review and finalize our plans and the associated financial impact. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.2% for the second quarter and 35.3% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q2 and for the full year. 
For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.03 billion to $5.12 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.66 to $0.72. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.4%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $20.79 billion and $21.08 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year of 2016 will range from $3.58 to $3.80. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65.
These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 4% square footage growth. 
And Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

In closing, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. 
Less than a full year since closing, we cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements, as evidenced by Family Dollar's 5.1% operating margin in the first quarter. We are finalizing the logistics initiatives to begin shipping product from our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah. And we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the year 3. I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. But this is just the beginning. There's much more do, and I'll tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 33 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our pricing remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. 
In the first quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 9.6%, same-store sales increased 2.2% and operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8%.
With the addition of Family Dollar, we are a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets while serving more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store, every day. Our future has never been brighter.

We'll continue to do that. And so I would tell you that our merchandise margin is likely to stay in a consistent range over the past several -- many years, we've performed within a very predictable range. This is the same to be a favorable time for costs, merchandise costs as well as freight rates. So that -- I would factor that into the equation as we look forward.

So as we are still in one of those times, where the low-income customers especially are under pressure, we intend to continue to provide great consumer products at Dollar Tree as well as the Family Dollar and great values for our customers at this project. And I'll close my long answer to your question, I apologize, but remember that, at Dollar Tree, the margin is as much about the mix of our product than the direct costs of the individual items. So when times are tough, we'll sell more consumer goods. When times improve, we'll sell a little more discretionary goods. Right now, in the first quarter, the mix is as I would have expected it, mainly because of the impact of Easter. Both banners sold a little more discretionary product."

Let me sort of describe the basics that we're doing because you go back to really the focus that we have in stores and delivering on many of the basics. And when we talk about table stakes, we're talking about some of the facility investments and investments in customer service. I would tell you the basis that we're also talking about is being ready on the first of month when many of our customers have more money in their pocket. It also translates for us in being weekend-ready when times current customers are coming to stores. So a lot of the focus for us is, let's be in stock. And that comes from the standpoint of making sure right products are in the right stores at the right time. But more than that, I would say, the initiative around having our folks ready to stock the product when our customers are coming to the store. So as we continue to push on the basics on the backside, of course, we're taking a look at adjacencies and productivity by department. These are the things we're working on in a tough environment in many stores to understand how do we continue long term to drive productivity into our Family Dollar store. But I would just tell you, we have a lot of upside on delivering on the basics for our customers. They really count on us around the key elements of the month and really delivering on the basics. And if we get that right, that's where we see driving more sales productivity and driving our comp store sales."

We're getting some of the beginnings of the work that we've done on synergy, lots of support from our vendor community. And I would tell you that both merchandising teams got off to a great start on that effort. And a piece of that is trying to show up because those costs have to roll through the inventory flow. So we're trying to get that. But as much as anything, I would say it's a mindful approach to what we're doing with our smart ways to save, what's on sale, what on price drop, our commitment to EDLP. Those are the basics that allows our customers great values everyday, puts a few arrows in our quiver to reach out to them the right way. We've had benefit of shrink this year, as you might expect, with our efforts to clean up the stores and get out to that inventory. That's always a plus for every retailer, no exception to us. We've seen that show up. And I would tell you our discretionary business has been a very bright spot for us, outpacing our consumables this quarter and really translates into really what our teams have brought to bear into our stores really across apparel and general merchandise and our seasonal. We're off to a great start in February and March going to the Easter holiday. So those are some of the things driving the margin and the execution of what we view in-store. I think you've touched on the store base. Exactly, the big opportunity we saw and what we made us think this is a big idea. And I would tell you, I'm satisfied across all 8,000 stores. But the opportunity for us, there's no surprises here, how do we focus on it. I would tell you this. We have lots of great stores and sometimes facilities are all that we can still start to clean them up, keep them all merchandise. And I just attended a handful of our sales meetings this April with our DM group. And that's really the focus for us to really get everybody on board with the initiatives that we're driving around table stakes. And while we want all boats to rise, and certainly they will, we're really focused on the key stores that are going to drive volume and bottom line contribution. And so across every operating region, down to the district, we've cut out those targets to really figure out how do we raise those stores' performance, both being in stock, the needs we have on a facility basis and the investment that we want to make in-store because it does need to show up to get product under the shelves, customer service. And so we're very focused on that core group of stores here because we can hitch our wagon to that and drive lots of sales and bottom line cash flow. And we continue to preach the initiatives to all 8,000 stores. We'll get there, but it's going to be a journey for us to fix the fleet that we have."

And we are keeping all of the things that are customer-facing in each brand, separate. We have a separate merchandise team for Dollar Tree than from Family Dollar. There's separate strategies and category initiatives, and all that goes with a different customer-facing things. And we're leveraging all the back-office, things that we can leverage the technology and with just support over both banners. So that's how we're thinking about it. The initiative to co-banner the DC and develop the ability to ship all banners from a DC, the first benefit that we'll see from that is our ability to use any excess capacity that we have across the nation for either banner. For example, we now have 21 distribution centers, going 22 distribution centers. And some are Family Dollar, and some are Dollar Tree. Some of our distribution centers are at capacity in one banner or the other, and the other banner, under capacity. So we can shift all banners out of all DCs, then we can effectively use our capacity without building more capacity because we have it in the right place. And also we can improve our stem models by being able to do that. That's just one of the opportunities that we have in logistics as we go forward.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%,",2205,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. 
This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.2%.
Total sales results were at the midpoint of our range of guidance. Operating income increased 80% to $418.7 million. Net income for the quarter increased 235% to $232.7 million. And earnings per share increased 188% to $0.98, which exceeded the high end of our first quarter range of guidance by $0.15.
I'm very pleased with our company's accomplishments for the first quarter. Sales were solidly within our range of guidance. SG&A expenses across both banners were well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8% for the quarter, and our Family Dollar segment first quarter operating margin improved to 5.1%. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.98 were $0.15 above the top end of our range of guidance. Excluding a $0.09 benefit from our lower-than-planned tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share were $0.89, which exceeded the top end of our range of guidance by $0.06 per share. 
Looking ahead, we have an incredible opportunity to increase shareholder value as a combined organization. Our integration of Family Dollar is on schedule, and the strategic rationale for the combination is as compelling as ever. As progress on our retail operation continues, there's an increased enthusiasm for the opportunity this merger presents to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways.
We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar, and we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real time, we're developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
Accomplishments continue to grow in the first quarter. In the Dollar Tree segment, sales increased 9.5%, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%. Sales increased as the result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products and through increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories included household products, candy and food, snacks and beverage and party supplies. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Mid-Atlantic, followed closely by the Midwest and the Northeast. 
I'm pleased with the consistent growth and the strength of the Dollar Tree business. This represented our 33rd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Cycling comp's up 3.4% last year. And through a volatile period for retail, our first quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they work hard to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store everyday. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the first quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons, party supplies and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and to Easter.
The red seasonal displays from February quickly turned green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies in preparation for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, fashion accessories, chocolate candy, baskets and basket stuffers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids.
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in the first quarter, our 30-year anniversary event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies, tremendous values and all priced, as it has been for the past 30 years, at just $1 per item. 
And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million-dollar brands with signing and special displays of these everyday items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for Mother's Day, Memorial Day and Summer Fun.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the first quarter, we opened a total of 112 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 25 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 126 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores. And we rebannered 3 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total 266 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. 
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% compared to the prior year, and we ended the first quarter with a total of 6,049 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I am pleased to report that since quarter-end, we have successfully completed the rebannering of all of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores, 9 were converted to Family Dollar stores and 3 were closing as their lease term expired. Going forward, all of our resources and efforts will be dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive-the-business initiatives include, number one, category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize, expand assortments and pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Number two, a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And number four, being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month, when many customers shopping for basic needs.
We're expanding our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 118 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,405 stores and growing. Our plan is to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016.
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and appropriate distribution capacity ahead of the need. I'm pleased to announce that construction on our newest DC, that would be Dollar Tree DC #11 in Cherokee County, South Carolina, was completed on schedule and on budget. This 1.5 million-square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We are currently receiving product at this facility and will begin shipping to stores from this new facility this quarter. 
Additionally, to support continued growth in Western markets, we are expanding our Stockton, California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet. This project is nearing completion.
And we're making meaningful progress in the Family Dollar banner. Less than 1 year into our integration, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stopped, we've cleaned up old inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. 
For the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. The same-store sales increase was driven by increased traffic, partially offset by a slight decline in average ticket. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables at the Family Dollar banner, with slightly higher comp sales growth in discretionary. 
The strongest sales increases by month were in February and March, reflecting the Easter shift. Geographically, comp store growth was led by the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 
For the first quarter at Family Dollar, we opened a total of 59 new Family Dollar stores, and we relocated or expanded 41 Family Dollar stores for a total of 100 projects. During the quarter, we rebannered Family Dollar stores -- 3 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 6 others were in the process of conversion at quarter-end. Additionally, 9 Deals store locations were converted to Family Dollars. We ended the first quarter with 7,948 Family Dollar stores. 
We're well on our way to achieving our announced Family Dollar store growth of 200 new stores in 2016. 
At quarter-end, we had a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,997 stores across North America.
As in Dollar Tree stores, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and value creation. Merchants and stores are working hard to be first of the month ready and weekend-ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing and the role of private label products while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic and stock levels. We're pleased with the initial reception and the traction we're gaining with our smart ways to save initiatives. Our goal is to communicate value to our customers. The key elements of smart ways to save are a combination of everyday low-price items, strategically planned sales and price drop promotions, incredible $1 wow items and a continually enhanced assortment of name brands, private label, name-brand equivalents and value brands. We're pleased with the Family Dollar traffic trends we experienced in Q1. To win back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visit, we are committed to improving their shopping experience.
There's a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions, where we aspire to offer a shopping experience that is bright, clean and free of clutter. There's a keen focus on the customer experience with a store that is full and in stock, easy to shop, full of product that is a trusted value. There's a focus on merchandise relevance. In the words of the customer, ""My Family Dollar has what I need."" There's a focus on customer engagement from friendly and informed associates. Importantly, not all of the table stakes initiatives require investment and expense or capital. By identifying and establishing winning retail disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. Our customer satisfaction surveys continue to reflect improvements in customer scores in each of our 4 primary survey categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvements in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar reestablishing itself as the convenience store of choice for our customer shopping trips. 
We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement while reducing costs, leveraging shared service and back-office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn, and we will invest prescriptively while measuring return on our investments. And as always, our P&L will continue to be managed line-by-line, quarter-by-quarter with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our updated expectations. 
Some comments on achieving synergies and delivering great values. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post-closing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime costs of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in 4 primary areas: one, sourcing and procurement; two, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; three, distribution and logistics; and four, overhead and corporate SG&A. At this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12-months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for the second quarter and for the full year 2016."

Total sales for the first quarter grew 134% to $5.09 billion, which includes our third full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion. 
Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 9.5% to $2.38 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 1.8% to $2.70 billion. 
Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by rebannered stores and divested stores.
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3% versus 3.4% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.2%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 108% to $1.55 billion through the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $805.7 million increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $733.8 million. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.6% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.4% during the first quarter, flat compared with the prior year's first quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise cost due to favorable freight cost, higher shrink as a result of unfavorable physical inventory results, higher distribution and occupancy cost as a percentage of net sales and cycling a onetime, $2 million, noncash charge from the prior year related to a change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 27.2% during the first quarter compared with 25.8% in the comparable period last prior year. Excluding the $6.3 million of inventory step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 27.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 160 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on, favorable freight costs and improved shrink, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 120% to $1.14 billion from $516.1 million in last year's first quarter. Majority of the $619.8 million increase related to $595.8 million of Family Dollar expense. 
Q1 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 22.6%, a 110-basis-point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $10.4 million of acquisition-related cost. Excluding the prior year's cost, SG&A improved 60 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.2% of sales for the prior year's quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs, including lower incentive compensation, health insurance and profit-sharing expense; and improved store operating costs as a percentage of sales related to lower utility costs. 
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.1% compared to 20.8% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.1% from 20.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased payroll and incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $37.5 million to $280.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income improved 60 basis points to 11.8% compared to 11.2% of sales in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $24.8 million to $170.9 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar Stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 100 basis points to 6.3% compared to 5.3% of sales from the prior year's comparable period.
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.1 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense of $87.3 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29.8% compared to 38.6% in the prior year's quarter. Our Q1 guidance was based on an expected tax rate of 36.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime benefit of state tax expense related to the fair market value of assets acquired from Family Dollar, in addition, a tax benefit from adopting ASU No. 2016-09 related to stock compensation accounting and an increase in work opportunity tax credits in relation to income for the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company had net income of $232.7 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes an approximate $0.09 benefit to Q1 EPS from the lower-than-anticipated tax rate. Excluding this onetime tax benefit and the prior-year quarter acquisition-related costs, diluted EPS improved by 25.4% to $0.89 from $0.71.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $929.7 million compared to $736.1 million at the end of 2015. Our outstanding long-term debt is approximately $7.5 billion.
Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 18.4% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.2%. The primary contributor to the year-over-year increases in inventory levels relates to the West Coast port disruptions we experienced a year ago. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end increased 2.2% over the same period last year, increased 5.9% on a per selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $175.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $66.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores or remodels, including 3 development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree Stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $162.3 million in the first quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million of depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $52.8 million in the first quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $5 million for Q2 and $13 million for fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounted policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. 
Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q2 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. 
Remaining inventory step-up amortization will be approximately $2 million in Q2. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016. We do not anticipate any share repurchase in 2016. And we cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates.
Please note that our fiscal 2016 outlook does not include any adjustments related to the recent FLSA announcement regarding changes to overtime regulation. The rule change affects a relatively small percentage of our workforce, and our store associates are competitively compensated. We continue to analyze the rule changes. We've put our action plans together throughout these changes. As always, we review cost pressures as a variable in our business that we are responsible to manage. Although still early in the analysis of the revised overtime regulations, as of now, our best current estimate is a potential impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter based on the December 1, 2016 implementation date. 
We will update this information as applicable, as we continue to review and finalize our plans and the associated financial impact. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.2% for the second quarter and 35.3% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q2 and for the full year. 
For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.03 billion to $5.12 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.66 to $0.72. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.4%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $20.79 billion and $21.08 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year of 2016 will range from $3.58 to $3.80. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65.
These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 4% square footage growth. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

In closing, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. 
Less than a full year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements, as evidenced by Family Dollar's 5.1% operating margin in the first quarter. We are finalizing the logistics initiatives to begin shipping product from our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the year 3. I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do. And I'll tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 33 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. 
In the first quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 9.6%, same-store sales increased 2.2% and operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8%.

There's nothing structurally that stands in our way of increasing our merchandise margins. As you know, in times of favorable buying opportunities, our retail is always $1. So we manage our cost in the market by -- and the value by looking at the cost. So many times, as we get lower cost, we turn it into better value product to drive more sales, more top line growth. We'll continue to do that. And so I would tell you that our merchandise margin is likely to stay in a consistent range over the past several -- many years, we've performed within a very predictable range. This is the same to be a favorable time for costs, merchandise costs as well as freight rates. So that -- I would factor that into the equation as we look forward. There's nothing standing in our way, frankly, from continuing to improve our margins. I won't tell you what because we do have to sort of follow the customer, and we've got to provide for the customers great values. And when times are tough, they want more of the things that they need every day. That's their first dollar that they spend. And then as they spend a second dollar, it's on things that are more discretionary. So as we are still in one of those times, where the low-income customers especially are under pressure, we intend to continue to provide great consumer products at Dollar Tree as well as the Family Dollar, and great values for our customers in this project. And I'll close my long answer to your question, I apologize, but remember that, at Dollar Tree, the margin is as much about the mix of our product than the direct cost of the individual items. So when times are tough, we'll sell more consumer goods. When times improve, we'll sell a little more discretionary goods. Right now, in the first quarter, the mix is as I would have expected it, mainly because of the impact of Easter. Both banners sold a little more discretionary product."

Let me sort of describe the basics that we're doing because you go back to really the focus that we have in stores and delivering on many of the basics. And when we talk about table stakes, we're talking about some of the facility investments and investments in customer service. I would tell you the basic that we're also talking about is being ready on first of month when many of our customers have more money in their pocket. It also translates for us into being weekend-ready when time-crunched customers are coming to the stores. So a lot of the focus, for us, is let's be in stock. And that comes from the standpoint of making sure the right products are in the right stores at the right time, but more than that, I would say the initiative around having our folks ready to stock the product when our customers are coming to the store. So as we continue to push on the basics on the backside, of course, we're taking a look at adjacencies and productivity by department. Those are the things we're working on in a tough environment in many stores to understand how do we continue over the long term to drive productivity into our Family Dollar store. But I would just tell you, we have a lot of upside on delivering on the basics for our customers. They really count on us around the key elements of the month and really delivering on the basics.

We're getting some of the beginnings of the work that we've done on synergy, lots of support from our vendor community. And I would tell you that both merchandising teams got off to a great start on that effort. And a piece of that is trying to show up because a lot of those costs have to roll through the inventory flow. So we're trying to get that. But as much as anything, I would say it's a mindful approach to what we're doing with our smart ways to save, what's on sale, what's on price drop, our commitment to EDLP. Those are the basics that allow us to give our customers great values everyday, puts a few arrows in our quiver to reach out to them the right way. We've had benefit of a shrink this year, as you might expect, with our efforts to clean up the stores and get down to that inventory. That's always a plus for every retailer, no exception to us. We've seen that show up. And I would tell you, our discretionary business has been a very bright spot for us, outpacing our consumables this quarter and really translates into really what our teams have brought to bear into our stores really across apparel and general merchandise and our seasonal. We're off to a great start in February and March going to the Easter holiday. So those are some of the things driving the margin and the execution of what we view in-store. I think you've touched on the store base, exactly the big opportunity we saw and what really made us think this is a big idea. And I would tell you, I'm not satisfied across all 8,000 stores. But the opportunity for us, there's no surprises here, how do we focus on it? I would tell you this. We have lots of great stores that sometimes the facilities are old that we can still start to clean them up, keep them all merchandised. And I just attended a handful of our sales meetings this April with our DM group. And that's really the focus for us to really get everybody on board with the initiatives that we're driving around table stakes. And while we want all boats to rise, and certainly they will, we're really focused on the key stores that are going to drive volume and bottom line contribution. And so across every operating region, down to the district, we've called out those targets to really figure out how do we raise those stores' performance, both being in stock, the needs we have on a facility basis and the investment that we want to make in-store because it does need to show up to get product under the shelves, customer service. And so we're very focused on that core group of stores here because we can hitch our wagon to that and drive lots of sales and bottom line cash flow. And we continue to preach the initiatives to all 8,000 stores. We'll get there, but this is going to be a journey for us to fix the fleet that we have."

And we are keeping all of the things that are customer-facing in each brand separate. We have a separate merchandise team for Dollar Tree than from Family Dollar. There are separate strategies and category initiatives and all that goes with the different customer-facing things. And we're leveraging all the back-office, things that we can leverage with technology and with just support over both banners. So that's how we're thinking about it. The initiative to co-banner the DC and develop the ability to ship all banners from a DC, the first benefit that we'll see from that is our ability to use any excess capacity that we have across the nation for either banner. For example, we now have 21 distribution centers, going 22 distribution centers. And some are Family Dollar and some are Dollar Tree. Some of our distribution centers are at capacity in one banner or the other, and the other banner under capacity. So if we could shift all banners out of all DCs, then we can more effectively use our capacity without building more capacity because we'd have it in the right place. And also, we can improve our stem miles by being able to do that. That's just one of the opportunities that we have in logistics as we go forward. We'll continue to rationalize the opportunity and look at more ways to become more productive across banners by using and leveraging the same technology."

So where are we on opening price point across every category? What's the role of private brands, the value brands ever placed? Some of it, quite frankly, is a placement of the merchandising energy that we have in-store. So because we had end caps tied up often with older inventory, we've been able to get that downstroke going of, what does our customer see in terms of fresh goods every month? Over the long run, it's really a question around the right SKUs or that is rationalization or that is the adjacencies of the departments, the flow of the stores. Those are the bigger levers that we're going to pull over the long term. But I give to credit to the energy and confidence our merchandising team has, in quick order, gotten the right items in front of our customers. Our customers shop differently first of the month to the end of the month. And we are going to know this customer better than anybody else in terms of how they shop us and their needs during the course of the month. So that's really our effort right now. The basics of product, price, placement are all the levers that we're working on right now to make sure we're serving our customer well."

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%,",2206,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. 
This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.2%.
Total sales results were at the midpoint of our range of guidance. Operating income increased 80% to $418.7 million. Net income for the quarter increased 235% to $232.7 million. And earnings per share increased 188% to $0.98, which exceeded the high end of our first quarter range of guidance by $0.15.
I'm very pleased with our company's accomplishments for the first quarter. Sales were solidly within our range of guidance. SG&A expenses across both banners were well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8% for the quarter, and our Family Dollar segment first quarter operating margin improved to 5.1%. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.98 were $0.15 above the top end of our range of guidance. Excluding a $0.09 benefit from our lower-than-planned tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share were $0.89, which exceeded the top end of our range of guidance by $0.06 per share. 
Looking ahead, we have an incredible opportunity to increase shareholder value as a combined organization. Our integration of Family Dollar is on schedule, and the strategic rationale for the combination is as compelling as ever. As progress on our retail operation continues, there's an increased enthusiasm for the opportunity this merger presents to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways.
We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar, and we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real time, we're developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
Accomplishments continue to grow in the first quarter. In the Dollar Tree segment, sales increased 9.5%, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%. Sales increased as the result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products and through increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories included household products, candy and food, snacks and beverage and party supplies. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Mid-Atlantic, followed closely by the Midwest and the Northeast. 
I'm pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This represented our 33rd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Cycling comp's up 3.4% last year, and through a volatile period for retail, our first quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they work hard to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the first quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons, party supplies and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and Easter.
The red seasonal displays from February quickly turned green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies in preparation for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, fashion accessories, chocolate candy, baskets and basket stuffers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids.
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in the first quarter, our 30-year anniversary event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies, tremendous values and all priced, as it has been for the past 30 years, at just $1 per item. 
And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million-dollar brands with signing and special displays of these every day items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for Mother's Day, Memorial Day and Summer Fun.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the first quarter, we opened a total of 112 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 25 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 126 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores. And we rebannered 3 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 266 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. 
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% compared to the prior year, and we ended the first quarter with a total of 6,049 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I am pleased to report that since quarter-end, we have successfully completed the rebannering of all of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores, 9 were converted to Family Dollar stores and 3 were closing as their lease term expired. Going forward, all of our resources and efforts will be dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive-the-business initiatives include, number one: Category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Number two, a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And number four, being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month, when many customers are shopping for basic needs.
We're expanding our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 118 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,405 stores and growing. Our plan is to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016.
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and appropriate distribution capacity ahead of the need. I'm pleased to announce that construction on our newest DC -- that would be Dollar Tree DC #11 in Cherokee County, South Carolina, was completed on schedule and on budget. This 1.5 million-square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We are currently receiving product at this facility and will begin shipping to stores from this new facility this quarter. 
Additionally, to support continued growth in Western markets, we are expanding our Stockton, California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet. This project is nearing completion.
And we're making meaningful progress in the Family Dollar banner. Less than one year into our integration, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked, we've cleaned up old inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. 
For the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. The same-store sales increase was driven by increased traffic, partially offset by a slight decline in average ticket. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables at the Family Dollar banner, with slightly higher comp sales growth in discretionary. 
The strongest sales increases by month were in February and March, reflecting the Easter shift. Geographically, comp store growth was led by the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 
For the first quarter at Family Dollar, we opened a total of 59 new Family Dollar stores, and we relocated or expanded 41 Family Dollar stores for a total of 100 projects. During the quarter, we rebannered Family Dollar stores -- 3 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 6 others were in the process of conversion at quarter-end. Additionally, 9 Deals store locations were converted to Family Dollars. We ended the first quarter with 7,948 Family Dollar stores. 
We're well on our way to achieving our announced Family Dollar store growth of 200 new stores in 2016. 
At quarter-end, we had a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,997 stores across North America.
As in Dollar Tree stores, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and value creation. Merchants and stores are working hard to be first-of-the-month ready and weekend-ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing and the role of private label products while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic in-stock levels. We're pleased with the initial reception and the traction we're gaining with our smart ways to save initiatives. Our goal is to communicate value to our customers. The key elements of smart ways to save are a combination of every day low-price items, strategically planned sales and price drop promotions, incredible $1 wow items and a continually enhanced assortment of name brands, private label, name-brand equivalents and value brands. We're pleased with the Family Dollar traffic trends we experienced in Q1. To win back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visit, we are committed to improving their shopping experience.
There's a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions, where we aspire to offer a shopping experience that is bright, clean and free of clutter. There's a keen focus on the customer experience with a store that is full and in stock, easy to shop, full of product that is of trusted value. There's a focus on merchandise relevance. In the words of the customer, ""My Family Dollar has what I need."" There's a focus on customer engagement from friendly and informed associates. Importantly, not all of the table stakes initiatives require investment and expense or capital. By identifying and establishing winning retail disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. Our customer satisfaction surveys continue to reflect improvements in customer scores in each of our 4 primary survey categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvements in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar reestablishing itself as the convenience store of choice for our customer shopping trips. 
We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement while reducing costs, leveraging shared service and back-office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn, and we will invest prescriptively while measuring return on our investments. And as always, our P&L will continue to be managed line-by-line, quarter-by-quarter with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our updated expectations. 
Some comments on achieving synergies and delivering great values. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post-closing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime costs of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in four primary areas: one, sourcing and procurement; two, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; three, distribution and logistics; and four, overhead and corporate SG&A. At this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12-months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for the second quarter and for the full year 2016."

Total sales for the first quarter grew 134% to $5.09 billion, which includes our third full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion. 
Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 9.5% to $2.38 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 1.8% to $2.70 billion. 
Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by rebannered stores and divested stores.
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3% versus 3.4% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.2%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 108% to $1.55 billion through the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $805.7 million increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $733.8 million. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.6% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.4% during the first quarter, flat compared with the prior year's first quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise cost due to favorable freight cost, higher shrink as a result of unfavorable physical inventory results, higher distribution and occupancy cost as a percentage of net sales and cycling the onetime, $2 million, noncash charge from the prior year related to a change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 27.2% during the first quarter compared with 25.8% in the comparable period last -- prior year. Excluding the $6.3 million of inventory step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 27.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 160 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on, favorable freight costs and improved shrink, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 120% to $1.14 billion from $516.1 million in last year's first quarter. The majority of the $619.8 million increase related to $595.8 million of Family Dollar expense. 
Q1 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 22.6%; a 110-basis-point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $10.4 million of acquisition-related cost. Excluding the prior year's cost, SG&A improved 60 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.2% of sales for the prior year's quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs, including lower incentive compensation, health insurance and profit-sharing expense; and improved store operating costs as a percentage of sales related to lower utility costs. 
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.1% compared to 20.8% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.1% from 20.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased payroll and incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $37.5 million to $280.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income improved 60 basis points to 11.8% compared to 11.2% of sales in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $24.8 million to $170.9 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar Stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 100 basis points to 6.3% compared to 5.3% of sales from the prior year's comparable period.
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.1 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense of $87.3 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29.8% compared to 38.6% in the prior year's quarter. Our Q1 guidance was based on an expected tax rate of 36.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime benefit in state tax expense related to the fair market value of assets acquired from Family Dollar, in addition, a tax benefit from adopting ASU No. 2016-09 related to stock compensation accounting and an increase in work opportunity tax credits in relation to income for the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company had net income of $232.7 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes an approximate $0.09 benefit to Q1 EPS from the lower-than-anticipated tax rate. Excluding this onetime tax benefit and the prior-year quarter acquisition-related costs, diluted EPS improved by 25.4% to $0.89 from $0.71.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $929.7 million compared to $736.1 million at the end of 2015. Our outstanding long-term debt is approximately $7.5 billion.
Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 18.4% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.2%. The primary contributor to the year-over-year increases in inventory levels relates to the West Coast port disruptions we experienced a year ago. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end increased 2.2% over the same period last year, increased 5.9% on a per selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $175.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $66.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores or remodels, including 3 [ph] development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree Stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $162.3 million in the first quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million of depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $52.8 million in the first quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for two items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $5 million for Q2 and $13 million for fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounted policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation.  Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q2 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. 
Remaining inventory step-up amortization will be approximately $2 million in Q2. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016. We do not anticipate any share repurchase in 2016. And we cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates.
Please note that our fiscal 2016 outlook does not include any adjustments related to the recent FLSA announcement regarding changes to overtime regulation. The rule change affects a relatively small percentage of our workforce, and our exempt store associates are competitively compensated. We continue to analyze the rule changes as we put our action plans together throughout these changes. As always, we review cost pressures as a variable in our business that we are responsible to manage. Although still early in the analysis of the revised overtime regulations. As of now, our best current estimate is a potential impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter based on the December 1, 2016 implementation date. 
We will update this information as applicable, as we continue to review and finalize our plans and the associated financial impact. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.2% for the second quarter and 35.3% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q2 and for the full year. 
For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.03 billion to $5.12 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.66 to $0.72. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.4%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $20.79 billion and $21.08 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year of 2016 will range from $3.58 to $3.80. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65.
These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 4% square footage growth. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

In closing, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. Less than a full year since closing",413,"Thanks, Kevin. In closing, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. 
Less than a full year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements, as evidenced by Family Dollar's 5.1% operating margin in the first quarter. We are finalizing the logistics initiatives to begin shipping product from our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies. By the end of year 3, I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do. And I'll tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 33 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. 
In the first quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 9.6%, same-store sales increased 2.2% and operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8%.
With the addition of Family Dollar, we are a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets, while serving more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store, every day. Our future has never been brighter.

There's nothing structurally that stands in our way of increasing our merchandise margins. As you know, in times of favorable buying opportunities, our retail is always $1. So we manage our cost in the market by -- and the value by looking at the cost. So many times, as we get a lower cost, we turn it into better value product to drive more sales, more top line growth. We'll continue to do that. And so I would tell you that our merchandise margin is likely to stay in a consistent range over the past several -- many years, we've performed within a very predictable range. This is -- does seem to be a favorable time for costs, merchandise costs as well as freight rates. So that -- I would factor that into the equation as we look forward. There's nothing standing in our way, frankly, from continuing to improve our margins. I won't tell you what because we do have to sort of follow the customer, and we've got to provide for the customer the great values. And when times are tough, they want more of the things that they need every day. That's their first dollar that they spend. And then if they spend a second dollar, it's on things that are more discretionary. So as we are still in one of those times, where the low-income customers especially are under pressure, we intend to continue to provide great consumer products at Dollar Tree as well as at Family Dollar, and great values for our customers in those projects. And I'll close my long answer to your question, I apologize, but remember that, at Dollar Tree, the margin is as much about the mix of our product than the direct cost of the individual items. So when times are tough, we'll sell more consumer goods. When times improve, we'll sell a little more discretionary goods. Right now, in the first quarter, the mix is as I would have expected it, mainly because of the impact of Easter. Both banners sold a little more discretionary product."

And that comes from the standpoint of making sure the right products are in the right stores at the right time, but more than that, I would say the initiative around having our folks ready to stock the product when our customers are coming to the store. So as we continue to push on the basics, on the backside of course we're taking a look at adjacencies and productivity by department. Those are the things we're working on in a tough environment in many stores to understand how do we continue over the long term to drive productivity into our Family Dollar store.

We're getting some of the beginnings of the work that we've done on synergy, lots of support from our vendor community. And I would tell you that both merchandising teams got off to a great start on that effort. And a piece of that is trying to show up. Because a lot of those costs have to roll through the inventory flow. So we're trying to get that. But as much as anything, I would say it's a mindful approach to what we're doing with our smart ways to save, what's on sale, what's on price drop, our commitment to EDLP. Those are the basics that allow us to give our customers great values every day, puts a few arrows in our quiver to reach out to them the right way. We've had benefit of a shrink this year, as you might expect, with our efforts to clean up the stores and get down -- get inventory. That's always a plus for every retailer, no exception to us. We've seen that show up. And I would say our discretionary business has been a very bright spot for us, outpacing our consumables this quarter and really translates into really what our teams have brought to bear into our stores really across apparel and general merchandise and our seasonal. We're off to great starts in February and March going to the Easter holiday. So those are some of the things driving the margin and the execution of what we do in-store. I think you've touched on the store base, exactly the big opportunity we saw and what really made us think this is a big idea. And I would tell you, I'm not satisfied across all 8,000 stores. But the opportunity for us, there's no surprises here, how do we focus on it? I would tell you this. We have lots of great stores that sometimes the facilities are old that we can still start to clean them up, keep them well-merchandised. And I just attended a handful of our sales meetings this April with our DM group. And that's really the focus for us to really get everybody on board with the initiatives that we're driving around table stakes. And while we want all boats to rise, and certainly they will, we're really focused on the key stores that are going to drive volume and bottom line contribution. And so across every operating region, down to the district, we've called out those targets to really figure out how do we raise those stores' performance, both being in-stock, the needs we have on a facility basis and the investment that we want to make in-store because it does need to show up to get product under the shelves, customer service. And so we're very focused on that core group of stores here because we can hitch our wagon to that and drive lots of sales and bottom line cash flow. And we continue to preach the initiatives to all 8,000 stores. We'll get there, but this is going to be a journey for us to fix the fleet that we have."

And we are keeping all of the things that are customer-facing in each brand separate. We have a separate merchandise team for Dollar Tree than from Family Dollar. There are separate strategies and category initiatives and all that goes with the different customer-facing things. And we're leveraging all the back-office, things that we can leverage with technology and with just support over both banners. So that's how we're thinking about it. The initiative to co-banner the DC and develop the ability to ship all banners from a DC, the first benefit that we'll see from that is our ability to use any excess capacity that we have across the nation for either banner. For example, we now have 21 distribution centers, going on 22 distribution centers. And some are Family Dollar and some are Dollar Tree. Some of our distribution centers are at capacity in one banner or the other, and the other banner under capacity. So if we could ship all banners out of all DCs, then we could more effectively use our capacity without building more capacity because we'd have it in the right place. And also, we can improve our stem miles by being able to do that. That's just one of the opportunities that we have in logistics as we go forward.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%,",2206,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. 
This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total sales for the quarter increased 134% to $5.09 billion. And same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.2%.
Total sales results were at the midpoint of our range of guidance. Operating income increased 80% to $418.7 million. Net income for the quarter increased 235% to $232.7 million. And earnings per share increased 188% to $0.98, which exceeded the high end of our first quarter range of guidance by $0.15.
I'm very pleased with our company's accomplishments for the first quarter. Sales were solidly within our range of guidance. SG&A expenses across both banners were well-managed. Our Dollar Tree segment operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8% for the quarter, and our Family Dollar segment first quarter operating margin improved to 5.1%. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.98 were $0.15 above the top end of our range of guidance. Excluding a $0.09 benefit from our lower-than-planned tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share were $0.89, which exceeded the top end of our range of guidance by $0.06 per share. 
Looking ahead, we have an incredible opportunity to increase shareholder value as a combined organization. Our integration of Family Dollar is on schedule, and the strategic rationale for the combination is as compelling as ever. As progress on our retail operation continues, there's an increased enthusiasm for the opportunity this merger presents to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways.
We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar, and we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business in real time, we're developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
Accomplishments continue to grow in the first quarter. In the Dollar Tree segment, sales increased 9.5%, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%. Sales increased as the result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products and through increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top-performing categories included household products, candy and food, snacks and beverage and party supplies. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Mid-Atlantic, followed closely by the Midwest and the Northeast. 
I'm pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This represented our 33rd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Cycling comp's up 3.4% last year, and through a volatile period for retail, our first quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they work hard to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the first quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever. 
Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons, party supplies and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and Easter.
The red seasonal displays from February quickly turned green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies in preparation for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, fashion accessories, chocolate candy, baskets and basket stuffers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids.
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in the first quarter, our 30-year anniversary event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies, tremendous values and all priced, as it has been for the past 30 years, at just $1 per item. 
And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million-dollar brands with signing and special displays of these every day items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for Mother's Day, Memorial Day and Summer Fun.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the first quarter, we opened a total of 112 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 25 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 126 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores. And we rebannered 3 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 266 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. 
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% compared to the prior year, and we ended the first quarter with a total of 6,049 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I am pleased to report that since quarter-end, we have successfully completed the rebannering of all of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores, 9 were converted to Family Dollar stores and 3 were closing as their lease term expired. Going forward, all of our resources and efforts will be dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive-the-business initiatives include, number one: Category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Number two, a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And number four, being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month, when many customers are shopping for basic needs.
We're expanding our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 118 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,405 stores and growing. Our plan is to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016.
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and appropriate distribution capacity ahead of the need. I'm pleased to announce that construction on our newest DC -- that would be Dollar Tree DC #11 in Cherokee County, South Carolina, was completed on schedule and on budget. This 1.5 million-square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We are currently receiving product at this facility and will begin shipping to stores from this new facility this quarter. 
Additionally, to support continued growth in Western markets, we are expanding our Stockton, California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet. This project is nearing completion.
And we're making meaningful progress in the Family Dollar banner. Less than 1 year into our integration, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked, we've cleaned up old inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved, validating that customers are taking notice. 
For the quarter, the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single-digit positive comp store sales increase. The same-store sales increase was driven by increased traffic, partially offset by a slight decline in average ticket. Same-store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables at the Family Dollar banner, with slightly higher comp sales growth in discretionary. 
The strongest sales increases by month were in February and March, reflecting the Easter shift. Geographically, comp store growth was led by the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 
For the first quarter at Family Dollar, we opened a total of 59 new Family Dollar stores, and we relocated or expanded 41 Family Dollar stores for a total of 100 projects. During the quarter, we rebannered Family Dollar stores -- 3 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 6 others were in the process of conversion at quarter-end. Additionally, 9 Deals store locations were converted to Family Dollars. We ended the first quarter with 7,948 Family Dollar stores. 
We're well on our way to achieving our announced Family Dollar store growth of 200 new stores in 2016. 
At quarter-end, we had a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,997 stores across North America.
As in Dollar Tree stores, our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and value creation. Merchants and stores are working hard to be first-of-the-month ready and weekend-ready. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing and the role of private label products while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic in-stock levels. We're pleased with the initial reception and the traction we're gaining with our smart ways to save initiatives. Our goal is to communicate value to our customers. The key elements of smart ways to save are a combination of every day low-price items, strategically planned sales and price drop promotions, incredible $1 wow items and a continually enhanced assortment of name brands, private label, name-brand equivalents and value brands. We're pleased with the Family Dollar traffic trends we experienced in Q1. To win back our Family Dollar customers' confidence and frequency of visit, we are committed to improving their shopping experience.
There's a keen focus on table stakes, including store standards and conditions, where we aspire to offer a shopping experience that is bright, clean and free of clutter. There's a keen focus on the customer experience with a store that is full and in stock, easy to shop, full of product that is of trusted value. There's a focus on merchandise relevance. In the words of the customer, ""My Family Dollar has what I need."" There's a focus on customer engagement from friendly and informed associates. Importantly, not all of the table stakes initiatives require investment and expense or capital. By identifying and establishing winning retail disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. Our customer satisfaction surveys continue to reflect improvements in customer scores in each of our 4 primary survey categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvements in each of these metrics will contribute to Family Dollar reestablishing itself as the convenience store of choice for our customer shopping trips. 
We will manage investments in table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement while reducing costs, leveraging shared service and back-office functions and reinvesting some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree, we will test and learn, and we will invest prescriptively while measuring return on our investments. And as always, our P&L will continue to be managed line-by-line, quarter-by-quarter with a keen eye on ROI. Our quarterly guidance will reflect our updated expectations. 
Some comments on achieving synergies and delivering great values. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post-closing. And as previously disclosed, these synergies will be achieved with onetime costs of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in 4 primary areas: one, sourcing and procurement; two, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; three, distribution and logistics; and four, overhead and corporate SG&A. At this stage, we are clearly on track to achieve our first 12-months milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for the second quarter and for the full year 2016."

Total sales for the first quarter grew 134% to $5.09 billion, which includes our third full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion. 
Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 9.5% to $2.38 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 1.8% to $2.70 billion. 
Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by rebannered stores and divested stores.
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3% versus 3.4% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.2%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 108% to $1.55 billion through the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $805.7 million increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $733.8 million. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.6% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.4% during the first quarter, flat compared with the prior year's first quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise cost due to favorable freight cost, higher shrink as a result of unfavorable physical inventory results, higher distribution and occupancy cost as a percentage of net sales and cycling the onetime, $2 million, noncash charge from the prior year related to a change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 27.2% during the first quarter compared with 25.8% in the comparable period last -- prior year. Excluding the $6.3 million of inventory step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 27.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 160 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on, favorable freight costs and improved shrink, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 120% to $1.14 billion from $516.1 million in last year's first quarter. The majority of the $619.8 million increase related to $595.8 million of Family Dollar expense. 
Q1 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 22.6%; a 110-basis-point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $10.4 million of acquisition-related cost. Excluding the prior year's cost, SG&A improved 60 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.2% of sales for the prior year's quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by payroll-related costs, including lower incentive compensation, health insurance and profit-sharing expense; and improved store operating costs as a percentage of sales related to lower utility costs. 
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.1% compared to 20.8% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.1% from 20.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased payroll and incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs for the Dollar Tree segment, increased $37.5 million to $280.7 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income improved 60 basis points to 11.8% compared to 11.2% of sales in the prior year's first quarter. 
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $24.8 million to $170.9 million. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar Stores. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 100 basis points to 6.3% compared to 5.3% of sales from the prior year's comparable period.
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.1 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense of $87.3 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29.8% compared to 38.6% in the prior year's quarter. Our Q1 guidance was based on an expected tax rate of 36.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime benefit in state tax expense related to the fair market value of assets acquired from Family Dollar, in addition, a tax benefit from adopting ASU No. 2016-09 related to stock compensation accounting and an increase in work opportunity tax credits in relation to income for the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company had net income of $232.7 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes an approximate $0.09 benefit to Q1 EPS from the lower-than-anticipated tax rate. Excluding this onetime tax benefit and the prior-year quarter acquisition-related costs, diluted EPS improved by 25.4% to $0.89 from $0.71.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $929.7 million compared to $736.1 million at the end of 2015. Our outstanding long-term debt is approximately $7.5 billion.
Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 18.4% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.2%. The primary contributor to the year-over-year increases in inventory levels relates to the West Coast port disruptions we experienced a year ago. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end increased 2.2% over the same period last year, increased 5.9% on a per selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $175.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $66.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores or remodels, including 3 [ph] development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree Stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $162.3 million in the first quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $7.8 million of depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $52.8 million in the first quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $5 million for Q2 and $13 million for fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounted policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation.  Secondly, it includes $18.7 million for Q2 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. 
Remaining inventory step-up amortization will be approximately $2 million in Q2. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016. We do not anticipate any share repurchase in 2016. And we cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates.
Please note that our fiscal 2016 outlook does not include any adjustments related to the recent FLSA announcement regarding changes to overtime regulation. The rule change affects a relatively small percentage of our workforce, and our exempt store associates are competitively compensated. We continue to analyze the rule changes as we put our action plans together throughout these changes. As always, we review cost pressures as a variable in our business that we are responsible to manage. Although still early in the analysis of the revised overtime regulations. As of now, our best current estimate is a potential impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter based on the December 1, 2016 implementation date. 
We will update this information as applicable, as we continue to review and finalize our plans and the associated financial impact. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.2% for the second quarter and 35.3% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q2 and for the full year. 
For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.03 billion to $5.12 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.66 to $0.72. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.4%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $20.79 billion and $21.08 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year of 2016 will range from $3.58 to $3.80. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.65.
These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 4% square footage growth. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

In closing, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. 
Less than a full year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements, as evidenced by Family Dollar's 5.1% operating margin in the first quarter. We are finalizing the logistics initiatives to begin shipping product from our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies. By the end of year 3, I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do. And I'll tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 33 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. 
In the first quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 9.6%, same-store sales increased 2.2% and operating margin improved 60 basis points to 11.8%.
With the addition of Family Dollar, we are a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets, while serving more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store, every day. Our future has never been brighter.

There's nothing structurally that stands in our way of increasing our merchandise margins. As you know, in times of favorable buying opportunities, our retail is always $1. So we manage our cost in the market by -- and the value by looking at the cost. So many times, as we get a lower cost, we turn it into better value product to drive more sales, more top line growth. We'll continue to do that. And so I would tell you that our merchandise margin is likely to stay in a consistent range over the past several -- many years, we've performed within a very predictable range. This is -- does seem to be a favorable time for costs, merchandise costs as well as freight rates. So that -- I would factor that into the equation as we look forward. There's nothing standing in our way, frankly, from continuing to improve our margins. I won't tell you what because we do have to sort of follow the customer, and we've got to provide for the customer the great values. And when times are tough, they want more of the things that they need every day. That's their first dollar that they spend. And then if they spend a second dollar, it's on things that are more discretionary. So as we are still in one of those times, where the low-income customers especially are under pressure, we intend to continue to provide great consumer products at Dollar Tree as well as at Family Dollar, and great values for our customers in those projects. And I'll close my long answer to your question, I apologize, but remember that, at Dollar Tree, the margin is as much about the mix of our product than the direct cost of the individual items. So when times are tough, we'll sell more consumer goods. When times improve, we'll sell a little more discretionary goods. Right now, in the first quarter, the mix is as I would have expected it, mainly because of the impact of Easter. Both banners sold a little more discretionary product."

So as we continue to push on the basics, on the backside of course we're taking a look at adjacencies and productivity by department. Those are the things we're working on in a tough environment in many stores to understand how do we continue over the long term to drive productivity into our Family Dollar store.

We're getting some of the beginnings of the work that we've done on synergy, lots of support from our vendor community. And I would tell you that both merchandising teams got off to a great start on that effort. And a piece of that is trying to show up. Because a lot of those costs have to roll through the inventory flow. So we're trying to get that. But as much as anything, I would say it's a mindful approach to what we're doing with our smart ways to save, what's on sale, what's on price drop, our commitment to EDLP. Those are the basics that allow us to give our customers great values every day, puts a few arrows in our quiver to reach out to them the right way. We've had benefit of a shrink this year, as you might expect, with our efforts to clean up the stores and get down -- get inventory. That's always a plus for every retailer, no exception to us. We've seen that show up. And I would say our discretionary business has been a very bright spot for us, outpacing our consumables this quarter and really translates into really what our teams have brought to bear into our stores really across apparel and general merchandise and our seasonal. We're off to great starts in February and March going to the Easter holiday. So those are some of the things driving the margin and the execution of what we do in-store. I think you've touched on the store base, exactly the big opportunity we saw and what really made us think this is a big idea. And I would tell you, I'm not satisfied across all 8,000 stores. But the opportunity for us, there's no surprises here, how do we focus on it? I would tell you this. We have lots of great stores that sometimes the facilities are old that we can still start to clean them up, keep them well-merchandised. And I just attended a handful of our sales meetings this April with our DM group. And that's really the focus for us to really get everybody on board with the initiatives that we're driving around table stakes. And while we want all boats to rise, and certainly they will, we're really focused on the key stores that are going to drive volume and bottom line contribution. And so across every operating region, down to the district, we've called out those targets to really figure out how do we raise those stores' performance, both being in-stock, the needs we have on a facility basis and the investment that we want to make in-store because it does need to show up to get product under the shelves, customer service. And so we're very focused on that core group of stores here because we can hitch our wagon to that and drive lots of sales and bottom line cash flow. And we continue to preach the initiatives to all 8,000 stores. We'll get there, but this is going to be a journey for us to fix the fleet that we have."

There are separate strategies and category initiatives and all that goes with the different customer-facing things. And we're leveraging all the back-office, things that we can leverage with technology and with just support over both banners. So that's how we're thinking about it. The initiative to co-banner the DC and develop the ability to ship all banners from a DC, the first benefit that we'll see from that is our ability to use any excess capacity that we have across the nation for either banner. For example, we now have 21 distribution centers, going on 22 distribution centers. And some are Family Dollar and some are Dollar Tree. Some of our distribution centers are at capacity in one banner or the other, and the other banner under capacity. So if we could ship all banners out of all DCs, then we could more effectively use our capacity without building more capacity because we'd have it in the right place. And also, we can improve our stem miles by being able to do that. That's just one of the opportunities that we have in logistics as we go forward.

But early indications on the rebanner is that it's, first of all, our margins go up substantially when we rebanner to a Dollar Tree. The sales are -- it's, on average, we like the total sales. We have some stores that are outperforming what we expected and some that are underperforming. So if you look at the average, we're where we need to be. So one of the things we're continuing to do is look at the performance and marry that back up to the analysis and look at, what makes a great Family Dollar to Dollar Tree? What's the best? And where do those fall? And how can we improve this process? So we're going to do approximately 100 more this year. The -- again, we took a short break on the rebannering early on to get the Deals stores rebannered. And now we've completed that project, so we're back onto the Family Dollar.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on Ju",1468,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015. 
Total sales for the second quarter increased 65.9% to $5 billion, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.1%. 
Operating income increased 189.5% to $357.2 million. Net income for the quarter was $170.2 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, which was the top end of our guidance of $0.66 to $0.72 per diluted share. 
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the second quarter. We delivered our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. The gross margin rate in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners improved year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 300 basis points to 7.1% for the quarter, and earnings per share were at the top of our range of guidance. 
We're making progress in the integration of Family Dollar and in the achievement of our previously announced run-rate synergies of $300 million by the end of the third full year post-acquisition. This includes savings and direct and indirect procurement, improvements in sales and profitability from the rebannering of underperforming stores and the development of our shared-services model, including supply chain and logistics. There's much more to be done, and I believe we're on pace to surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the second quarter included a total sales increase of 8.5%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%. I will add, this was in the face of headwinds from our rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores, and this was achieved through balanced increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points, and operating margin improved 110 basis points from the prior year's quarter to 11%. Excluding acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 30 basis points. Top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner included party supplies, snacks and beverage, toys and household products. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. And geographically, Dollar Tree banner same-store sales growth was strong as in the Midwest and in the Southwest. 
The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our second quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp store growth. 
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. 
Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever, and our merchandise margin increased once again in the second quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience, and seasonal energy was hot in many beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, Dollar Tree stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes in the celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun, reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, along with a strong basics performance. May was the best month for comp store sales. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the back-to-school season. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the second quarter, we opened a total of 99 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 18 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered the remaining 32 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 47 Family Dollars to Dollar Trees for a total of 196 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. 
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% over the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,184 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we successfully completed the rebannering of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores. 9 Deals stores were converted to Family Dollar stores, and 3 were closed as their lease term expired. All of our resources and efforts are now dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree, where everything is $1 and Family Dollar, your neighborhood discount store. 
I'm especially pleased with our rebannering efforts. Over the past 4 quarters, our Dollar Tree banner store development teams have rebannered 210 Deals stores to Dollar Tree and 251 underperforming Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 384 new Dollar Tree stores. As a result, we ended second quarter this year with a total of 845 more Dollar Tree stores than we ended the second quarter last year. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing well in terms of sales and improved profitability. While this is the right decision for the long term, and in the near term, there was increased pressure from cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 additional basis points during the second quarter. We expect this to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our Drive The Business initiatives include category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. 
A fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. And at Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first of the month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekend and especially at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 157 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,559 stores and growing, and we're well on our way with our plan to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016. 
We continue to invest in infrastructure. Dollar Tree DC 11, our new 1.5 million square foot South Carolina distribution center, was completed on time and began serving stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in June. The expansion of our Stockton, California DC is adding additional capacity as we grow in our West Coast stores. And the work to co-banner the Family Dollar DC in St. George, Utah has been completed. This DC is now servicing both banners from the same facility. With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create more shareholder value as a combined organization. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar, and we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organizations. With a focus on managing our business in real-time, our eyes are on the future as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priorities."

We continue to make progress at Family Dollar that's driving our performance and customer-facing initiatives. Now 1 year into the integration, our customers are seeing stores that are cleaner, better merchandised on promotional end caps, elimination of old inventory and improvement on our in-stock position. Certainly, more work is to be done across these important customer-facing initiatives. Our feedback has been positive. Store teams have received the tools to do better with these initiatives and have respond with great efforts to drive our in-store customer experience. 
For second quarter, our same-store sales for the Family Dollar banner were slightly negative and were affected by the calendar shift, which moved the August 1 of the month from second quarter last year into third quarter of this year. Ask improved slightly against negative transactions. Our performance was balanced between discretionary and consumable, with consumables performing slightly better than our discretionary business. Stronger sales were up the beginning of the quarter. July was slightly negative. And geographically, comp store sales were strongest in our West and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
In real estate, we opened 57 new Family Dollar stores, relocated or expanded 34 Family Dollar stores for a total of 91 total projects. We rebannered 47 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 7 others were in the process of conversion at quarter end. We ended the quarter with 7,945 Family Dollar stores, and we continue to track on achieving our previously announced target of 200 new Family Dollar stores in 2016. 
At quarter end, we have total of over 14,000, 14,129, to be exact, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
At Family Dollar, our focus remains around 3 fundamental principles: Know our customer, improve our shopping experience and drive the value equation for our customer. This translates into our customer-facing messaging in there and in-store, which is our smart ways to save program. We're pleased with the reception and traction from our customers. The value at Family Dollar is built upon this simple thought: Smart ways to save based around EDLP pricing on key items for our customer, price drop on planned items for our customers' shopping list, Dollar well items on key opening price point SKUs in comparing sake for our most meaningful, incredible value private-brand items. We're also placing continued emphasis on our national brand items that are most meaningful and complemented with other value brands that emphasize the value of our assortments. 
We continue to win back customers and drive additional visits. We have worked on our promise to deliver a better customer experience. We call these our table stakes, the building of a foundation for an improved customer experience at Family Dollar. These include store standards and conditions, neat, clean, full, recovered, merchandising relevance and energy. Family Dollar has what I need and at a value I recognize. And customer engagement. We call this Family Dollar-friendly. Our team members are part of the neighborhood they serve. We are convenient and friendly. While some of these require investments in facilities or equipment or labor, not everything does as we continue to have our field teams make the progress on the basics of truck-to-floor and recovery standards. Our merchants and field teams are working hard to be first-at-month ready and weekend-ready, when our customers count on us the most. Displays and recovery around these important days are part of our planning and execution. We know our customers measure us against their view of store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service, speed of checkout. We're working hard to deliver these elements across 8,000 stores. We can be the store of choice for our customers' basic shopping needs, along with the excitement of seeing the newness of the seasons and holidays. Our investment in the business and our table stakes initiatives are being managed with the same disciplined approach we built the Dollar Tree business for, for many years.

While we have more to do, we have a motivated team at Family Dollar that us to drive value to our customer that is often underserved and store teams that with the right tools, can win in their store neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for Q3 and full year 2016."
27685,380874623,1038895,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter included 1 month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full 3",2045,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning. As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter included 1 month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full 3 months for the Dollar Tree -- for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 65.9% to $5 billion, which includes our fourth full quarter of Family Dollar sales. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.5% to $2.39 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 4.5% to $2.61 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by the removal of 268 stores, which were rebannered as Dollar Tree stores and 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. The total reduction in Family Dollar store count as a result of rebannering and divestiture is 593. 
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2% versus 2.7% in the prior year's second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from 465 Family Dollar and Deals stores, which have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. As Bob mentioned, the incremental cannibalization was approximately 80 basis points for Q2. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.1%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 76.8% to $1.51 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $657.2 million increase was driven by the addition of Family Dollar's gross profit for the full quarter of $588.4 million as the second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of the Family Dollar performance. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.2% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.3% during the second quarter, a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior year's second quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment increased $588.4 million. The increased amount was due to the 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.6% during the second quarter compared with 22.9% in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $1.9 million in the current quarter and $11.1 million in the prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.7% for this quarter compared with 23.3% in the prior year's full quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher mark-on, lower shrink and the prior year period being negatively impacted due to the $60 million of mark-on expense related to SKU rationalization and plant liquidations. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 57.9% to $1.16 billion from $731.8 million for the -- in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $423.4 million increase related to $398.6 million of incremental Family Dollar expense. 
Q2 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.3%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $16.5 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related costs, SG&A, as a percent of sales, decreased 10 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.4% of sales for the prior year's quarter. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven primarily by lower payroll costs as we implemented our shared-service model, lower incentive cost based on performance and reduced legal expenses. These were partially offset by higher store hourly payroll costs and store operating costs related to HVAC repair costs. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment increased $398.7 million. The increased amount was due to 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 23% compared to 22.5% in the prior year's full quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rates amortization and $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $7.5 million of acquisition-related costs, $6.5 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $6.5 million for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased store payroll, incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $357.2 million compared with $123.4 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 7.1% for the quarter from 4.1% in last year's second quarter. The increase included an incremental $189.7 million related to the additional 9 weeks of operations for Family Dollar in the second quarter of 2016. Operating margin -- operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 110 basis points to 11% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding $16.5 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 11% compared to 10.7% of sales in the prior year's second quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Dollar Family Dollar segment increased $189.7 million to 3.6%. Excluding the $1.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, $18.7 million for favorable lease rates amortization and the $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, operating profit margin for Family Dollar in the quarter was 4.6%. 
In the prior year, the Family Dollar segment incurred an operating loss primarily as a result of markdowns related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations of nonbilled forward merchandise. 
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.3 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax expense rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared to a tax benefit of 31.1% in prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to a pretax loss for the second quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter, the company had net income of $170.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter and totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 15.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 4.3%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 1.5% from the same period last year and decreased 2.2 -- it increased 2.2% on a selling square foot basis. 
We're pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We're continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the third quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $100.1 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including 3 development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $161.9 million for the second quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for the favorable lease rates amortization and $5 million depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $89.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $30 [ph] million all in the first half of fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounted policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.4 million for Q3 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rates for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. The acquired stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2016. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales days, shift into our fourth quarter. We reflected this shift accordingly in our sales guidance. There are 2 additional days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. 
We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into our both rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $88 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. We are currently reviewing opportunities to refinance our current debt structure given market conditions in the debt capital markets. Our guidance does not include any effect of potential reduced interest expense or noncash charges for deferred financing fees to be written off if a transaction is consummated. They make material changes would be communicated via an 8-K upon closing of a transaction. 
Our updated full year guidance now includes an estimated impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect in December. Our guidance incorporates the costs and synergies from our corporate restructuring related to merger integration that was announced on August 4. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. 
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 29.9% for the third quarter and 33.7% for fiscal 2016. The lower rate in Q3 is a result of the state of North Carolina lowering its corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3%, beginning January 1, 2017. The company estimates this change will decrease its deferred tax liability and decrease its tax expense. The company expects to recognize a onetime tax benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.09 per share in Q3 of fiscal 2016. 
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q3 and for the full year. For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.02 billion to $5.10 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP in the range of $0.76 to $0.82, which includes the expected onetime tax benefit of $0.09 per share. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.5%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range from $20.69 billion to $20.87 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.79 billion to $21.08 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.82. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.58 to $3.80. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase and a 4% square footage growth. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

And again, I'm pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. Just over a year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and the stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements. We have successfully launched and are testing the results of our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared-services model for support functions. We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of year 3, and I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. 
But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I will tell you that as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It is a powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 34 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. In the second quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.5%. Same-store sales increased 1.2%, and operating margin improved to 11%. 
Over the past 3 weeks, I have attended and presented at our Family Dollar segment's Annual Leadership Conference and our Dollar Tree segment's Annual Field Management Meeting. I really like what I see. Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.

That was an impact we saw in both banners, especially in the Family Dollar banner. In the Dollar Tree banner, we experienced a little more cannibalization than we typically do, so we called that out. But basically, it's just mostly driven by the consumer. We are watching the competition. Retail is very competitive, as we all know, it's a competitive business. We watch what they do and we react accordingly with prices or with sometimes learning it helps us along the way, too. So we're looking at the competition.

So when we shifted that into the next quarter, I think that impacted it greatly. The other thing is we're having some really great seasonal and variety efforts in our Dollar Tree segment. The merchandise has just been terrific. The value and our variety merchandise continues to get better. When I pointed out that for 30 years, price has been $1, but our values are better and our margin -- our initial mark-up continues to increase, that's true. Our buyers doing a terrific job in sourcing and couple that along with some favorable freight rates, rate and/or transportation costs in the U.S. and we really are getting greater value than our variety merchandise, still at a $1 price point. And by the way, a little higher margins. So I attribute it to terrific merchandising and especially in the Dollar Tree variety segment."

One of our smart ways to save. It can be Dollar items. It can be private-brand items that are tied into our great value on a national brand end cap. Our ability to have cleaned up end caps now gives us the opportunity to do some of those things we were not able to a year ago. Up and down the aisle, we want our customers to see a promise of rate everyday low price. We want to make sure we're calling out our Dollar well. We've added a couple hundred Dollar items over the past year, but this is not about converting a Family Dollar into Dollar Tree. We have a great private-brand program that we're polishing up and enhancing. We want to make sure that on sale, we have the right national brand items and are at there driving traffic. So it's not just one tool we're using. We want to be certainly competitive as we measure the competition. But really, for our customers at Family Dollar, we have very been that all those things together that we're describing in smart ways to save to execute very well first of month, but then the balance of the month as well. Our customer shops differently at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. It's really something that I think is unique to Family Dollar, with a customer base we serve it. We're getting smarter on how they respond on both promotions and then what we show in store. So that's the work that we're working very hard to get on and improve our sales trajectory on. But..."

So the idea of planning for capacity needs is we're continuing to grow is a high priority that we're spending time on what do we need going forward based on our growth, number one. Number two, the integration and how we put these 2 banners together to better serve not only the new growth, but also the existing businesses. So lots of things are going on with the St. George. It was the first one. It's only been a couple months, few months, I think June, I guess, is when we brought that up. And there's some refinements there in process of doing on that. But we have been able, we've done the hard work of integrating and shipping both banners out of one distribution center. That gives us the ability going forward to take advantage of capacity and assist them no matter where it exists by using it for both banners. It gives us the ability to reduce our stem miles in the future, so that if we can deliver both banners as the same DCs, then certainly, we can get the best stem mile. So there's a lot of payback there, but it is taking a little time on integration because of technology. We're continuing to grow and we're not going to miss anything there. We still have to continue to provide capacity as we continue to grow. And frankly, the engineered standards that we're doing is really, really important to us as we go forward and combine these 2 banners and combine these 2 networks, doing it the most efficient way and reducing cost per building is a big idea. So we're working really hard on it. The time line is a still little bit in flux.

So obviously, we're testing some things are now in our stores as to how we'll address this. It is a bigger effect on a dollar basis in the Family Dollar better than the Dollar Tree banner.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on Ju",1464,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015. 
Total sales for the second quarter increased 65.9% to $5 billion, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.1%. 
Operating income increased 189.5% to $357.2 million. Net income for the quarter was $170.2 million. And GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, which was the top end of our guidance of $0.66 to $0.72 per diluted share. 
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the second quarter. We delivered our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. The gross margin rate in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners improved year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 300 basis points to 7.1% for the quarter, and earnings per share were at the top of our range of guidance. 
We're making progress in the integration of Family Dollar and in the achievement of our previously announced run-rate synergies of $300 million by the end of the third full year post-acquisition. This includes savings and direct and indirect procurement, improvements in sales and profitability from the rebannering of underperforming stores and the development of our shared-services model, including supply chain and logistics. There's much more to be done, and I believe we're on pace to surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the second quarter included a total sales increase of 8.5%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%. I will add, this was in the face of headwinds from our rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores, and this was achieved through balanced increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points, and operating margin improved 110 basis points from the prior year's quarter to 11%. Excluding acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 30 basis points. 
Top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner included party supplies, snacks and beverage, toys and household products. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. And geographically, Dollar Tree banner same-store sales growth was strong as in the Midwest and in the Southwest. 
The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our second quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping in our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. 
Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever, and our merchandise margin increased once again in the second quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience, and seasonal energy was hot in May, beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, Dollar Tree stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes in the celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, along with a strong basics performance, May was the best month for comp store sales. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the back-to-school season. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the second quarter, we opened a total of 99 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 18 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered the remaining 32 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 47 Family Dollars to Dollar Trees for a total of 196 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% over the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,184 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we successfully completed the rebannering of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores. 9 Deals stores were converted to Family Dollar stores, and 3 were closed as their lease term expired. All of our resources and efforts are now dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree, where everything is $1; and Family Dollar, your neighborhood discount store. 
I'm especially pleased with our rebannering efforts. Over the past 4 quarters, our Dollar Tree banner store development teams have rebannered 210 Deals stores to Dollar Tree and 251 underperforming Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, in addition to opening 384 new Dollar Tree stores. As a result, we ended the second quarter of this year with a total of 845 more Dollar Tree stores than we ended the second quarter last year. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing well in terms of sales and improved profitability. While this is the right decision for the long term, and in the near term, there was increased pressure from cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 additional basis points during the second quarter, we expect this to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive-the-business initiatives include category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. 
A fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. And at Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekend and especially at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 157 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,559 stores and growing. And we're well on our way with our plan to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016. 
We continue to invest in infrastructure. Dollar Tree DC11, our new 1.5 million square foot South Carolina distribution center, was completed on time and began serving stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in June. The expansion of our Stockton, California DC is adding additional capacity as we grow in our West Coast stores. And the work to co-banner the Family Dollar DC in St. George, Utah has been completed. This DC is now servicing both banners from the same facility. 
With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create more shareholder value as a combined organization. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organizations. With a focus on managing our business in realtime, our eyes are on the future as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priorities."

We continue to make progress at Family Dollar that's driving our performance and customer-facing initiatives. Now 1 year into the integration, our customers are seeing stores that are cleaner, better merchandised on promotional end caps, elimination of old inventory and improvement on our in-stock position. Certainly, more work is to be done across these important customer-facing initiatives. Our feedback has been positive. Store teams have received the tools to do better with these initiatives and have respond with great efforts to drive our in-store customer experience. 
For second quarter, our same-store sales for the Family Dollar banner were slightly negative and were affected by the calendar shift, which moved the August 1 of the month from second quarter last year into third quarter of this year. Basket improved slightly against negative transactions. Our performance was balanced between discretionary and consumable, with consumables performing slightly better than our discretionary business. Stronger sales were up the beginning of the quarter, July was slightly negative. And geographically, comp store sales were strongest in our West and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
In real estate, we opened 57 new Family Dollar stores, relocated or expanded 34 Family Dollar stores for a total of 91 total projects. We rebannered 47 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 7 others were in the process of conversion at quarter end. We ended the quarter with 7,945 Family Dollar stores, and we continue to track on achieving our previously announced target of 200 new Family Dollar stores in 2016. At quarter end, we have total of over 14,000, 14,129, to be exact, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
At Family Dollar, our focus remains around 3 fundamental principles: know our customer, improve our shopping experience and drive the value equation for our customer. This translates into our customer-facing messaging in there and in-store, which is our ""smart ways to save"" program. We're pleased with the reception and traction from our customers. The value at Family Dollar is built upon this simple thought, ""smart ways to save"", based around EDLP pricing on key items for our customer, price drop on planned items for our customers' shopping list, Dollar well items on key opening price point SKUs and compare and save for our most meaningful, incredible value private-brand items. We're also placing continued emphasis on our national brand items that are most meaningful and complemented with other value brands that emphasize the value of our assortments. 
We continue to win back customers and drive additional visits. We have worked on our promise to deliver a better customer experience. We call these our table stakes, the building of a foundation for an improved customer experience at Family Dollar. These include store standards and conditions; neat, clean, full, recovered; merchandising relevance and energy; Family Dollar has what I need and at a value I recognize; and customer engagement, we call this Family Dollar-friendly. Our team members are part of the neighborhood they serve. We are convenient and friendly. While some of these require investments in facilities or equipment or labor, not everything does as we continue to have our field teams make progress on the basics of truck-to-floor and recovery standards. 
Our merchants and field teams are working hard to be first-of-month ready and weekend-ready, when our customers count on us the most. Displays and recovery around these important days are part of our planning and execution. We know our customers measure us against their view of store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service, speed of checkout. We're working hard to deliver these elements across 8,000 stores. We can be the store of choice for our customers' basic shopping needs, along with the excitement of seeing the newness of the seasons and holidays. Our investment in the business and our table stakes initiatives are being managed with the same disciplined approach we built the Dollar Tree business for, for many years. Our focus is on what our customer needs and gives us credit for, adapting along the way the important productivity enhancements that allow us to reduce cost within our systems and process, then reinvesting some of these savings again, where our customers will see benefit. Test and learn is part of the process and points us to the best areas to invest. 
While we have more to do, we have a motivated team at Family Dollar that intended to drive value to our customer that is often underserved and store teams that with the right tools, can win in their store neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for Q3 and full year 2016."
27685,380874623,1039035,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter included 1 month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full 3",2044,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning. As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter included 1 month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full 3 months for the Dollar Tree -- for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 65.9% to $5 billion, which includes our fourth full quarter of Family Dollar sales. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.5% to $2.39 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 4.5% to $2.61 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by the removal of 268 stores, which were rebannered as Dollar Tree stores, and 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. The total reduction in Family Dollar store count as a result of rebannering and divestitures is 593. 
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2% versus 2.7% in the prior year's second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from 465 Family Dollar and Deals stores, which have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. As Bob mentioned, the incremental cannibalization was approximately 80 basis points for Q2. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.1%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 76.8% to $1.51 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $657.2 million increase was driven by the addition of Family Dollar's gross profit for the full quarter of $588.4 million as the second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of the Family Dollar performance. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.2% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.3% during the second quarter, a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior year's second quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment increased $588.4 million. The increased amount was due to the 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.6% during the second quarter compared with 22.9% in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $1.9 million in the current quarter and $11.1 million in the prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.7% for this quarter compared with 23.3% in the prior year's full quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher mark-on, lower shrink and the prior year period being negatively impacted due to the $60 million of markdown expense related to SKU rationalization and plant liquidations. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 57.9% to $1.16 billion from $731.8 million for the -- in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $423.4 million increase related to $398.6 million of incremental Family Dollar expense. 
Q2 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.3%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $16.5 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related costs, SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 10 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.4% of sales for the prior year's quarter. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven primarily by lower payroll costs as we implemented our shared-service model, lower incentive cost based on performance and reduced legal expenses. These were partially offset by higher store hourly payroll costs and store operating costs related to HVAC repair costs. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment increased $398.7 million. The increased amount was due to 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 23% compared to 22.5% in the prior year's full quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $7.5 million of acquisition-related costs, $6.5 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $6.5 million for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased store payroll, incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $357.2 million compared with $123.4 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 7.1% for the quarter from 4.1% in last year's second quarter. The increase included an incremental $189.7 million related to the additional 9 weeks of operations for Family Dollar in the second quarter of 2016. Operating margin -- operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 110 basis points to 11% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding $16.5 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 11% compared to 10.7% of sales in the prior year's second quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Dollar Family Dollar segment increased $189.7 million to 3.6%. Excluding the $1.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and the $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, operating profit margin for Family Dollar in the quarter was 4.6%. 
In the prior year, the Family Dollar segment incurred an operating loss, primarily as a result of markdowns related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations of non-go-forward merchandise. 
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.3 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax expense rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared to a tax benefit of 31.1% in prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to a pretax loss for the second quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter, the company had net income of $170.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 15.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 4.3%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 1.5% from the same period last year and decreased 2.2 -- and increased 2.2% on a selling square foot basis. 
We're pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the third quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $100.1 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including few development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $161.9 million for the second quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for the favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $89.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $30 million all in the first half of fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.4 million for Q3 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. The acquired stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2016. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales days, shift into our fourth quarter. We reflected this shift accordingly in our sales guidance. There are 2 additional days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. 
We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $88 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. We are currently reviewing opportunities to refinance our current debt structure given market conditions in the debt capital markets. Our guidance does not include any effect of potential reduced interest expense or noncash charges for deferred financing fees to be written off if a transaction is consummated. Any material changes would be communicated via an 8-K upon closing of a transaction. 
Our updated full year guidance now includes an estimated impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect in December. Our guidance incorporates the costs and synergies from our corporate restructuring related to merger integration that was announced on August 4. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. 
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 29.9% for the third quarter and 33.7% for fiscal 2016. The lower rate in Q3 is a result of the state of North Carolina lowering its corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3%, beginning January 1, 2017. The company estimates this change will decrease its deferred tax liability and decrease its tax expense. The company expects to recognize a onetime tax benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.09 per share in Q3 of fiscal 2016. 
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q3 and for the full year. For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.02 billion to $5.10 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.76 to $0.82, which includes the expected onetime tax benefit of $0.09 per share. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.5%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range from $20.69 billion to $20.87 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.79 billion to $21.08 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.82. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.58 to $3.80. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase and a 4% square footage growth.

And again, I'm pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. Just over a year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and the stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements. We have successfully launched and are testing the results of our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared-services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of year 3, and I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. 
But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I will tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. 
For 34 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. In the second quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.5%, same-store sales increased 1.2% and operating margin improved to 11%. 
Over the past 3 weeks, I have attended and presented at our Family Dollar segment's Annual Leadership Conference and our Dollar Tree segment's Annual Field Management Meeting. I really like what I see. Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.

We still believe the consumer is under a lot of pressure. There's been a lot of talk about lower gas prices, which over the past year, I guess, lower, they seem to pop up and down here and there. But the consumer is still seeing a lot of pressure on cost increase with rent and just food and health care and taxes and all the things. So we see them as still being under pressure. I think that's the #1 issue that we see out there. Gary mentioned the calendar shift that put first-of-the-month money into the next quarter. That was an impact we saw in both banners, especially in the Family Dollar banner. In the Dollar Tree banner, we experienced a little more cannibalization than we typically do, so we called that out. But basically, it's just mostly driven by the consumer. We are watching the competition. Retail is a very competitive -- as we all know, a competitive business. We watch what they do, and we react accordingly with prices or with -- sometimes learning what they're doing, it helps us along the way, too. So we're looking at the competition. We're shopping our prices throughout the quarter. We shop full book at -- once per quarter and the key items throughout the quarter. So we're keeping up with that. I can't tell you that that's been the -- an issue anymore, though, for us than it usually is."

So there's certainly those things that don't necessarily give you a credit on sales, but you just have to do. But our ability to really get our folks focus on really landing on those elements are most important. So maybe it's not a baseball game. Maybe it's polo where -- and run the second chukker.

Those things are what our customers will give us credit for. It's what we're focused on.

The science is obviously knowing what the rest of the world is doing, so we understand that very well monthly as we go through. I'd say the art of it, and here's what's important for us at Family Dollar, first-of-month is obviously very important for us. What I've learned over my time there is the items that we have to be ready for on first-of-month and the value equation we have to have on end caps, that's where we're focused on making sure our customer sees. One of our smart ways to save. It can be Dollar items. It can be private-brand items that are tied into our great value on a national brand end cap. Our ability to have cleaned up end caps now gives us the opportunity to do some of those things where we were not able to a year ago. Up and down the aisle, we want our customers to see a promise of great everyday low price. We want to make sure we're calling out our Dollar well. We've added a couple hundred Dollar items over the past year, but this is not about converting a Family Dollar into Dollar Tree. We have a great private-brand program that we're polishing up and enhancing. We want to make sure that on sale, we have the right national brand items in our add that are driving traffic. So it's not just one tool we're using. We want to certainly be competitive as we measure the competition. But really, for our customer at Family Dollar, we have to really knit all those things together that we're describing in smart ways to save to execute very well around first-of-month, but then the balance of the month as well. Our customer shops differently at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. It's really something that I think is unique to Family Dollar, with a customer base we serve. We're getting smarter on how they respond on both promotions and then what we show in store. So that's the work that we're working very hard to get smarter on and improve our sales trajectory on.

We're also looking at engineered standards and doing a lot of work, and especially in the Dollar Tree banner, as we bring these 2 companies together on engineered standards. So a lot of foundational work is being done right now with 22 distribution centers. So the idea of planning for capacity needs as we're continuing to grow is a high priority. So we're spending time on what do we need going forward based on our growth, number one. And number two, the integration and how do we put these 2 banners together to better serve not only the new growth, but also the existing businesses. So lots of things are going on with St. George. It was the first one. It's only been a couple months, few months. I think June, I guess, is when we brought that up. And there's some refinements that they're in process of doing on that. But we have been able -- we've done the hard work of integrating and shipping both banners out of one distribution center. That gives us the ability going forward to take advantage of capacity and assist them no matter where it exists by using it for both banners. It gives us the ability to reduce our stem miles in the future. So that we -- if we can deliver both banners out of the same DCs, then certainly, we can get the best stem miles. So there's a lot of payback there, but it is taking a little time on integration because of technology. We're continuing to grow, and we're not going to miss anything there. We still have to continue to provide capacity as we continue to grow. And frankly, the engineered standards work that we're doing is really, really important to us as we go forward and combine these 2 banners and combine these 2 networks, doing it the most efficient way and reducing cost per building is a big idea. So we're working really hard on it. The time line is still a little bit in flux.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on Ju",1462,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015. 
Total sales for the second quarter increased 65.9% to $5 billion, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.1%. 
Operating income increased 189.5% to $357.2 million. Net income for the quarter was $170.2 million. And GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, which was the top end of our guidance of $0.66 to $0.72 per diluted share. 
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the second quarter. We delivered our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. The gross margin rate in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners improved year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 300 basis points to 7.1% for the quarter, and earnings per share were at the top of our range of guidance. 
We're making progress in the integration of Family Dollar and in the achievement of our previously announced run-rate synergies of $300 million by the end of the third full year post-acquisition. This includes savings in direct and indirect procurement, improvements in sales and profitability from the rebannering of underperforming stores and the development of our shared-services model, including supply chain and logistics. There's much more to be done, and I believe we're on pace to surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the second quarter included a total sales increase of 8.5%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%. I will add, this was in the face of headwinds from our rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores, and this was achieved through balanced increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points, and operating margin improved 110 basis points from the prior year's quarter to 11%. Excluding acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 30 basis points. 
Top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner included party supplies, snacks and beverage, toys and household products. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. And geographically, Dollar Tree banner same-store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest and in the Southwest. 
The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our second quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping in our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. 
Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever, and our merchandise margin increased once again in the second quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience, and seasonal energy was high in May, beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, Dollar Tree stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes in the celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, along with a strong basics performance, May was the best month for comp store sales. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well balanced, seasonally relevant as stores prepared for the back-to-school season. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the second quarter, we opened a total of 99 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 18 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered the remaining 32 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 47 Family Dollars to Dollar Trees for a total of 196 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% over the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,184 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we successfully completed the rebannering of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores. 9 Deals stores were converted to Family Dollar stores, and 3 were closed as their lease term expired. All of our resources and efforts are now dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree, where everything is $1; and Family Dollar, your neighborhood discount store. 
I'm especially pleased with our rebannering efforts. Over the past 4 quarters, our Dollar Tree banner store development teams have rebannered 210 Deals stores to Dollar Tree and 251 underperforming Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, in addition to opening 384 new Dollar Tree stores. As a result, we ended the second quarter of this year with a total of 845 more Dollar Tree stores than we ended the second quarter last year. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing well in terms of sales and improved profitability. While this is the right decision for the long term, in the near term, there was increased pressure from cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 additional basis points during the second quarter, we expect this to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. 
In addition to new stores, we continued to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive-the-business initiatives include category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. 
A fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. And at Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekend and especially at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 157 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,559 stores and growing. And we're well on our way with our plan to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016. 
We continue to invest in infrastructure. Dollar Tree DC11, our new 1.5 million square foot South Carolina distribution center, was completed on time and began serving stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in June. The expansion of our Stockton, California DC is adding additional capacity as we grow in our West Coast stores. And the work to co-banner the Family Dollar DC in St. George, Utah has been completed. This DC is now servicing both banners from the same facility. 
With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create more shareholder value as a combined organization. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organizations. With a focus on managing our business in realtime, our eyes are on the future as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priorities."

We continue to make progress at Family Dollar that's driving our performance and customer-facing initiatives. Now 1 year into the integration, our customers are seeing stores that are cleaner, better merchandised on promotional end caps, elimination of old inventory and improvement on our in-stock position. Certainly, more work is to be done across these important customer-facing initiatives. Our feedback has been positive. Store teams have received the tools to do better with these initiatives and have responded with great efforts to drive our in-store customer experience. 
For second quarter, our same-store sales for the Family Dollar banner were slightly negative and were affected by the calendar shift, which moved the August 1 of the month from second quarter last year into third quarter this year. Basket improved slightly against negative transactions. Our performance was balanced between discretionary and consumable, with consumables performing slightly better than our discretionary business. Stronger sales were at the beginning of the quarter, July was slightly negative. And geographically, comp store sales were strongest in our West and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
In real estate, we opened 57 new Family Dollar stores, relocated or expanded 34 Family Dollar stores for a total of 91 total projects. We rebannered 47 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 7 others were in the process of conversion at quarter end. We ended the quarter with 7,945 Family Dollar stores, and we continue to track on achieving our previously announced target of 200 new Family Dollar stores in 2016. At quarter end, we have total of over 14,000, 14,129, to be exact, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
At Family Dollar, our focus remains around 3 fundamental principles: know our customer, improve our shopping experience and drive the value equation for our customer. This translates into our customer-facing messaging in-ad [ph] and in-store, which is our ""smart ways to save"" program. We're pleased with the reception and traction from our customers. The value at Family Dollar is built upon this simple thought, ""smart ways to save"", based around EDLP pricing on key items for our customer, price drop on planned items for our customers' shopping list, Dollar well [ph] items on key opening price point SKUs and compare and save for our most meaningful, incredible value private-brand items. We're also placing continued emphasis on our national brand items that are most meaningful and complemented with other value brands that emphasize the value of our assortments. 
We continue to win back customers and drive additional visits. We have worked on our promise to deliver a better customer experience. We call these our table stakes, the building of a foundation for an improved customer experience at Family Dollar. These include store standards and conditions; neat, clean, full, recovered; merchandising relevance and energy; Family Dollar has what I need and at a value I recognize; and customer engagement, we call this Family Dollar-friendly. Our team members are part of the neighborhood they serve. We are convenient and friendly. While some of these require investments in facilities or equipment or labor, not everything does as we continue to have our field teams make progress on the basics of truck-to-floor and recovery standards. 
Our merchants and field teams are working hard to be first-of-the-month ready and weekend-ready, when our customers count on us the most. Displays and recovery around these important days are part of our planning and execution. We know our customers measure us against their view of store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service, speed of checkout. We're working hard to deliver these elements across 8,000 stores. We can be the store of choice for our customers' basic shopping needs, along with the excitement of seeing the newness of the seasons and holidays. Our investment in the business and our table stakes initiatives are being managed with the same disciplined approach we built the Dollar Tree business for, for many years. Our focus is on what our customer needs and gives us credit for, adapting along the way as the important productivity enhancements that allow us to reduce cost within our systems and process, then reinvesting some of these savings again, where our customers will see benefit. Test and learn is part of the process and points us to the best areas to invest. 
While we have more to do, we have a motivated team at Family Dollar that is in this to drive value to a customer that is often underserved and store teams that with the right tools, can win in their store, neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for Q3 and full year 2016."

As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter included 1 month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full 3 months for the Dollar Tree -- for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 65.9% to $5 billion, which includes our fourth full quarter of Family Dollar sales. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.5% to $2.39 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 4.5% to $2.61 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by the removal of 268 stores, which were rebannered as Dollar Tree stores, and 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. The total reduction in Family Dollar store count as a result of rebannering and divestitures is 593. 
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2% versus 2.7% in the prior year's second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from 465 Family Dollar and Deals stores, which have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. As Bob mentioned, the incremental cannibalization was approximately 80 basis points for Q2. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.1%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 76.8% to $1.51 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $657.2 million increase was driven by the addition of Family Dollar's gross profit for the full quarter of $588.4 million as the second quarter of 2015 included only 1 month of the Family Dollar performance. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.2% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.3% during the second quarter, a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior year's second quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment increased $588.4 million. The increased amount was due to the 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.6% during the second quarter compared with 22.9% in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $1.9 million in the current quarter and $11.1 million in the prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.7% for this quarter compared with 23.3% in the prior year's full quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher mark-on, lower shrink and the prior year period being negatively impacted due to the $60 million of markdown expense related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 57.9% to $1.16 billion from $731.8 million for the -- in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $423.4 million increase related to $398.6 million of incremental Family Dollar expense. 
Q2 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.3%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $16.5 million of acquisition-related cost. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related cost, SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 10 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.4% of sales for the prior year's quarter. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven primarily by lower payroll costs as we implemented our shared-service model, lower incentive cost based on performance and reduced legal expenses. These were partially offset by higher store hourly payroll costs and store operating costs related to HVAC repair costs. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment increased $398.7 million. The increased amount was due to 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 23% compared to 22.5% in the prior year's full quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $7.5 million of acquisition-related costs, $6.5 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $6.5 million for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased store payroll, incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $357.2 million compared with $123.4 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 7.1% for the quarter from 4.1% in last year's second quarter. The increase included an incremental $189.7 million related to the additional 9 weeks of operations for Family Dollar in the second quarter of 2016. Operating margin -- operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 110 basis points to 11% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding $16.5 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 11% compared to 10.7% of sales in the prior year's second quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $189.7 million to 3.6%. Excluding the $1.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, the $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and the $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, operating profit margin for Family Dollar in the quarter was 4.6%. 
In the prior year, the Family Dollar segment incurred an operating loss, primarily as a result of markdowns related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations of non-go-forward merchandise. 
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.3 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax expense rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared to a tax benefit of 31.1% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to a pretax loss for the second quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter, the company had net income of $170.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 15.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 4.3%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 1.5% from the same period last year and decreased 2.2 -- and increased 2.2% on a selling square foot basis. 
We're pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the third quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $100.1 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including fee development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $161.9 million for the second quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for the favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $89.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $13 million all in the first half of fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.4 million for Q3 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting evaluation of Family Dollar leases. 
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. The acquired stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2016. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales days, shift into our fourth quarter. We reflected this shift accordingly in our sales guidance. There are 2 additional days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. 
We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $88 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. We are currently reviewing opportunities to refinance our current debt structure given market conditions in the debt capital markets. Our guidance does not include any effect of potential reduced interest expense or noncash charges for deferred financing fees to be written off if a transaction is consummated. Any material changes would be communicated via an 8-K upon closing of a transaction. 
Our updated full year guidance now includes an estimated impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect in December. Our guidance incorporates the costs and synergies from our corporate restructuring related to merger integration that was announced on August 4. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. 
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 29.9% for the third quarter and 33.7% for fiscal 2016. The lower rate in Q3 is the result of the state of North Carolina lowering its corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3%, beginning January 1, 2017. The company estimates this change will decrease its deferred tax liability and decrease its tax expense. The company expects to recognize a onetime tax benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.09 per share in Q3 of fiscal 2016. 
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q3 and for the full year. For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.02 billion to $5.10 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.76 to $0.82, which includes the expected onetime tax benefit of $0.09 per share. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.5%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range from $20.69 billion to $20.87 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.79 billion to $21.08 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.82. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.58 to $3.80. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase and a 4% square footage growth.

And again, I'm pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. Just over a year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and the stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements. We have successfully launched and are testing the results of our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared-services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of year 3, and I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. 
But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I will tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial [ph] emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. 
For 34 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. In the second quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.5%, same-store sales increased 1.2% and operating margin improved to 11%. 
Over the past 3 weeks, I have attended and presented at our Family Dollar segment's Annual Leadership Conference and our Dollar Tree segment's Annual Field Management Meeting. I really like what I see. Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree. 
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

But the consumer is still seeing a lot of pressure on cost increase with rent and just food and health care and taxes and all the things. So we see them as still being under pressure. I think that's the #1 issue that we see out there. Gary mentioned the calendar shift that put first-of-the-month money into the next quarter. That was an impact we saw in both banners, especially in the Family Dollar banner. In the Dollar Tree banner, we experienced a little more cannibalization than we typically do, so we called that out. But basically, it's just mostly driven by the consumer. We are watching the competition. Retail is a very competitive -- as we all know, a competitive business. We watch what they do, and we react accordingly with prices or with -- sometimes learning what others are doing, it helps us along the way, too. So we're looking at the competition. We're shopping our prices throughout the quarter. We shop the full book at -- once per quarter and the key items throughout the quarter. So we're keeping up with that.

So there's certainly those things that don't necessarily give you a credit on sales, but you just have to do. But our ability to really get our folks focused on really landing on those elements are most important. So maybe it's not a baseball game. Maybe it's polo where -- and we're in the second chukker.

The science is obviously knowing what the rest of the world is doing, so we understand that very well monthly as we go through. I'd say the art of it, and here's what's important for us at Family Dollar, first-of-month is obviously very important for us. What I've learned over my time there is the items that we have to be ready for on first-of-month and the value equation we have to have on end caps, that's where we're focused on making sure our customer sees one of our smart ways to save. It can be Dollar items. It can be private-brand items that are tied-in to a great value on a national brand end cap. Our ability to have cleaned up end caps now gives us the opportunity to do some of those things where we were not able to a year ago. Up and down the aisle, we want our customers to see a promise of great everyday low price. We want to make sure we're calling out our Dollar well. We've added a couple hundred Dollar items over the past year, but this is not about converting a Family Dollar into Dollar Tree. We have a great private-brand program that we're polishing up and enhancing. We want to make sure that on sale, we have the right national brand items in our ad that are driving traffic. So it's not just one tool we're using. We want to certainly be competitive as we measure the competition. But really, for our customer at Family Dollar, we have to really knit all those things together that we're describing in smart ways to save to execute very well around first-of-month, but then the balance of the month as well. Our customer shops differently at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. It's really something that I think is unique to Family Dollar, with the customer base we serve. We're getting smarter on how they respond on both promotions and then what we show in store.

So a lot of foundational work is being done right now with 22 distribution centers. So the idea of planning for capacity needs as we're continuing to grow is a high priority. So we're spending time on what do we need going forward based on our growth, number one. And number two, the integration and how do we put these 2 banners together to better serve not only the new growth, but also the existing businesses. So lots of things are going on with St. George. It was the first one. It's only been a couple months, few months. I think June, I guess, is when we brought that up. And there's some refinements that they're in process of doing on that. But we have been able -- we've done the hard work of integrating and shipping both banners out of one distribution center. That gives us the ability going forward to take advantage of capacity and the system no matter where it exists by using it for both banners. It gives us the ability to reduce our stem miles in the future. So that we -- if we can deliver both banners out of the same DCs, then certainly, we can get the best stem miles. So there's a lot of payback there, but it is taking a little time on integration because of technology. We're continuing to grow, and we're not going to miss anything there. We still have to continue to provide capacity as we continue to grow. And frankly, the engineered standards work that we're doing is really, really important to us as we go forward and combine these 2 banners and combine these 2 networks, doing it the most efficient way and reducing cost per building is a big idea.

As I said earlier in this call, the indirect spend is a huge opportunity for us as we get into all the things that we don't sell but that we use in the business and using the power of the combined companies to improve our buying and leverage on that is going to be a big extra. So I'm excited about our goals and exceeding our goals, and we're on target. So that's [indiscernible]."

Is that coming from better performance at the core Dollar Tree chain?

It is the period of time when, as you can imagine, our stores are very, very busy, requires our managers to work a lot of hours. And we, obviously, have to take that in consideration. So obviously, we're testing some things right now in our stores as to how we'll address this. It is a bigger effect on a dollar basis in the Family Dollar banner than the Dollar Tree banner. The Family Dollar banner has historically been more of a full-time employee model versus the Dollar Tree model, which has been more part-time staffing. And so things there we'll be looking at. But -- so you can't annualized it, and I think what we'll look to do is we'll learn, as we go through the fourth quarter, we'll be able to give a better product indication as to what we really believe the full year possibilities are after we get through the fourth quarter.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on Ju",1462,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only 1 month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015. 
Total sales for the second quarter increased 65.9% to $5 billion, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.1%. 
Operating income increased 189.5% to $357.2 million. Net income for the quarter was $170.2 million. And GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, which was the top end of our guidance of $0.66 to $0.72 per diluted share. 
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the second quarter. We delivered our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. The gross margin rate in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners improved year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 300 basis points to 7.1% for the quarter, and earnings per share were at the top of our range of guidance. 
We're making progress in the integration of Family Dollar and in the achievement of our previously announced run-rate synergies of $300 million by the end of the third full year post-acquisition. This includes savings in direct and indirect procurement, improvements in sales and profitability from the rebannering of underperforming stores and the development of our shared-services model, including supply chain and logistics. There's much more to be done, and I believe we're on pace to surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the second quarter included a total sales increase of 8.5%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%. I will add, this was in the face of headwinds from our rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores, and this was achieved through balanced increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points, and operating margin improved 110 basis points from the prior year's quarter to 11%. Excluding acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 30 basis points. 
Top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner included party supplies, snacks and beverage, toys and household products. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. And geographically, Dollar Tree banner same-store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest and in the Southwest. 
The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our second quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping in our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. 
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. 
Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever, and our merchandise margin increased once again in the second quarter. 
Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience, and seasonal energy was high in May, beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, Dollar Tree stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes in the celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, along with a strong basics performance, May was the best month for comp store sales. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well balanced, seasonally relevant as stores prepared for the back-to-school season. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the second quarter, we opened a total of 99 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 18 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered the remaining 32 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 47 Family Dollars to Dollar Trees for a total of 196 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% over the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,184 Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we successfully completed the rebannering of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores. 9 Deals stores were converted to Family Dollar stores, and 3 were closed as their lease term expired. All of our resources and efforts are now dedicated to our 2 primary growth banners: Dollar Tree, where everything is $1; and Family Dollar, your neighborhood discount store. 
I'm especially pleased with our rebannering efforts. Over the past 4 quarters, our Dollar Tree banner store development teams have rebannered 210 Deals stores to Dollar Tree and 251 underperforming Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, in addition to opening 384 new Dollar Tree stores. As a result, we ended the second quarter of this year with a total of 845 more Dollar Tree stores than we ended the second quarter last year. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing well in terms of sales and improved profitability. While this is the right decision for the long term, in the near term, there was increased pressure from cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 additional basis points during the second quarter, we expect this to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. 
In addition to new stores, we continued to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive-the-business initiatives include category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. 
A fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. And at Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekend and especially at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 157 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,559 stores and growing. And we're well on our way with our plan to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016. 
We continue to invest in infrastructure. Dollar Tree DC11, our new 1.5 million square foot South Carolina distribution center, was completed on time and began serving stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in June. The expansion of our Stockton, California DC is adding additional capacity as we grow in our West Coast stores. And the work to co-banner the Family Dollar DC in St. George, Utah has been completed. This DC is now servicing both banners from the same facility. 
With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create more shareholder value as a combined organization. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organizations. With a focus on managing our business in realtime, our eyes are on the future as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priorities."

We continue to make progress at Family Dollar that's driving our performance and customer-facing initiatives. Now 1 year into the integration, our customers are seeing stores that are cleaner, better merchandised on promotional end caps, elimination of old inventory and improvement on our in-stock position. Certainly, more work is to be done across these important customer-facing initiatives. Our feedback has been positive. Store teams have received the tools to do better with these initiatives and have responded with great efforts to drive our in-store customer experience. 
For second quarter, our same-store sales for the Family Dollar banner were slightly negative and were affected by the calendar shift, which moved the August 1 of the month from second quarter last year into third quarter this year. Basket improved slightly against negative transactions. Our performance was balanced between discretionary and consumable, with consumables performing slightly better than our discretionary business. Stronger sales were at the beginning of the quarter, July was slightly negative. And geographically, comp store sales were strongest in our West and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
In real estate, we opened 57 new Family Dollar stores, relocated or expanded 34 Family Dollar stores for a total of 91 total projects. We rebannered 47 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and 7 others were in the process of conversion at quarter end. We ended the quarter with 7,945 Family Dollar stores, and we continue to track on achieving our previously announced target of 200 new Family Dollar stores in 2016. At quarter end, we have total of over 14,000, 14,129, to be exact, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores across North America. 
At Family Dollar, our focus remains around 3 fundamental principles: know our customer, improve our shopping experience and drive the value equation for our customer. This translates into our customer-facing messaging in-ad [ph] and in-store, which is our ""smart ways to save"" program. We're pleased with the reception and traction from our customers. The value at Family Dollar is built upon this simple thought, ""smart ways to save"", based around EDLP pricing on key items for our customer, price drop on planned items for our customers' shopping list, Dollar well [ph] items on key opening price point SKUs and compare and save for our most meaningful, incredible value private-brand items. We're also placing continued emphasis on our national brand items that are most meaningful and complemented with other value brands that emphasize the value of our assortments. 
We continue to win back customers and drive additional visits. We have worked on our promise to deliver a better customer experience. We call these our table stakes, the building of a foundation for an improved customer experience at Family Dollar. These include store standards and conditions; neat, clean, full, recovered; merchandising relevance and energy; Family Dollar has what I need and at a value I recognize; and customer engagement, we call this Family Dollar-friendly. Our team members are part of the neighborhood they serve. We are convenient and friendly. While some of these require investments in facilities or equipment or labor, not everything does as we continue to have our field teams make progress on the basics of truck-to-floor and recovery standards. 
Our merchants and field teams are working hard to be first-of-the-month ready and weekend-ready, when our customers count on us the most. Displays and recovery around these important days are part of our planning and execution. We know our customers measure us against their view of store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service, speed of checkout. We're working hard to deliver these elements across 8,000 stores. We can be the store of choice for our customers' basic shopping needs, along with the excitement of seeing the newness of the seasons and holidays. Our investment in the business and our table stakes initiatives are being managed with the same disciplined approach we built the Dollar Tree business for, for many years. Our focus is on what our customer needs and gives us credit for, adapting along the way as the important productivity enhancements that allow us to reduce cost within our systems and process, then reinvesting some of these savings again, where our customers will see benefit. Test and learn is part of the process and points us to the best areas to invest. 
While we have more to do, we have a motivated team at Family Dollar that is in this to drive value to a customer that is often underserved and store teams that with the right tools, can win in their store, neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for Q3 and full year 2016."

As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter included 1 month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full 3 months for the Dollar Tree -- for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 65.9% to $5 billion, which includes our fourth full quarter of Family Dollar sales. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.5% to $2.39 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 4.5% to $2.61 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by the removal of 268 stores, which were rebannered as Dollar Tree stores, and 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. The total reduction in Family Dollar store count as a result of rebannering and divestitures is 593. 
Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2% versus 2.7% in the prior year's second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from 465 Family Dollar and Deals stores, which have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. As Bob mentioned, the incremental cannibalization was approximately 80 basis points for Q2. 
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.1%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased 76.8% to $1.51 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter. The majority of the $657.2 million increase was driven by the addition of Family Dollar's gross profit for the full quarter of $588.4 million as the second quarter of 2015 included only 1 month of the Family Dollar performance. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.2% for the quarter. 
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.3% during the second quarter, a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior year's second quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment increased $588.4 million. The increased amount was due to the 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.6% during the second quarter compared with 22.9% in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $1.9 million in the current quarter and $11.1 million in the prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.7% for this quarter compared with 23.3% in the prior year's full quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher mark-on, lower shrink and the prior year period being negatively impacted due to the $60 million of markdown expense related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 57.9% to $1.16 billion from $731.8 million for the -- in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $423.4 million increase related to $398.6 million of incremental Family Dollar expense. 
Q2 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.3%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $16.5 million of acquisition-related cost. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related cost, SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 10 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.4% of sales for the prior year's quarter. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven primarily by lower payroll costs as we implemented our shared-service model, lower incentive cost based on performance and reduced legal expenses. These were partially offset by higher store hourly payroll costs and store operating costs related to HVAC repair costs. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment increased $398.7 million. The increased amount was due to 9 additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 23% compared to 22.5% in the prior year's full quarter. The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year's comparable period included $7.5 million of acquisition-related costs, $6.5 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $6.5 million for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased store payroll, incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs. 
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $357.2 million compared with $123.4 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 7.1% for the quarter from 4.1% in last year's second quarter. The increase included an incremental $189.7 million related to the additional 9 weeks of operations for Family Dollar in the second quarter of 2016. Operating margin -- operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 110 basis points to 11% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding $16.5 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 11% compared to 10.7% of sales in the prior year's second quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $189.7 million to 3.6%. Excluding the $1.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, the $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and the $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, operating profit margin for Family Dollar in the quarter was 4.6%. 
In the prior year, the Family Dollar segment incurred an operating loss, primarily as a result of markdowns related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations of non-go-forward merchandise. 
Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.3 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax expense rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared to a tax benefit of 31.1% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to a pretax loss for the second quarter of 2015. 
For the second quarter, the company had net income of $170.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 15.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 10.4%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 4.3%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. 
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 1.5% from the same period last year and decreased 2.2 -- and increased 2.2% on a selling square foot basis. 
We're pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the third quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $100.1 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including fee development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $161.9 million for the second quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for the favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $89.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items, which are included in our guidance. First, it includes $13 million all in the first half of fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $18.4 million for Q3 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting evaluation of Family Dollar leases. 
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. The acquired stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2016. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales days, shift into our fourth quarter. We reflected this shift accordingly in our sales guidance. There are 2 additional days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. 
We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago. Interest expense will be approximately $88 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. We are currently reviewing opportunities to refinance our current debt structure given market conditions in the debt capital markets. Our guidance does not include any effect of potential reduced interest expense or noncash charges for deferred financing fees to be written off if a transaction is consummated. Any material changes would be communicated via an 8-K upon closing of a transaction. 
Our updated full year guidance now includes an estimated impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect in December. Our guidance incorporates the costs and synergies from our corporate restructuring related to merger integration that was announced on August 4. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. 
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 29.9% for the third quarter and 33.7% for fiscal 2016. The lower rate in Q3 is the result of the state of North Carolina lowering its corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3%, beginning January 1, 2017. The company estimates this change will decrease its deferred tax liability and decrease its tax expense. The company expects to recognize a onetime tax benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.09 per share in Q3 of fiscal 2016. 
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q3 and for the full year. For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.02 billion to $5.10 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.76 to $0.82, which includes the expected onetime tax benefit of $0.09 per share. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.5%. 
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range from $20.69 billion to $20.87 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.79 billion to $21.08 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.82. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.58 to $3.80. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase and a 4% square footage growth.

And again, I'm pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. Just over a year since closing, we've cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and the stores. The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements. We have successfully launched and are testing the results of our first co-banner DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared-services model for support functions. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of year 3, and I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. 
But this is just the beginning. There's much more to do, and I will tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial [ph] emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. 
For 34 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues. In the second quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.5%, same-store sales increased 1.2% and operating margin improved to 11%. 
Over the past 3 weeks, I have attended and presented at our Family Dollar segment's Annual Leadership Conference and our Dollar Tree segment's Annual Field Management Meeting. I really like what I see. Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.

I think that's the #1 issue that we see out there. Gary mentioned the calendar shift that put first-of-the-month money into the next quarter. That was an impact we saw in both banners, especially in the Family Dollar banner. In the Dollar Tree banner, we experienced a little more cannibalization than we typically do, so we called that out. But basically, it's just mostly driven by the consumer. We are watching the competition. Retail is a very competitive -- as we all know, a competitive business. We watch what they do, and we react accordingly with prices or with -- sometimes learning what others are doing, it helps us along the way, too. So we're looking at the competition.

So there's certainly those things that don't necessarily give you a credit on sales, but you just have to do. But our ability to really get our folks focused on really landing on those elements are most important. So maybe it's not a baseball game. Maybe it's polo where -- and we're in the second chukker.

I haven't quantified that, I'm not ready to do that right now. But we are well on track with that. There are still terrific opportunities in our indirect spend. There's just more there to be done. There's a lot more to be done in our supply chain. That's a big cost, a big expense, and we're really -- the supply chain team is really doing some great work right now.

The science is obviously knowing what the rest of the world is doing, so we understand that very well monthly as we go through. I'd say the art of it, and here's what's important for us at Family Dollar, first-of-month is obviously very important for us. What I've learned over my time there is the items that we have to be ready for on first-of-month and the value equation we have to have on end caps, that's where we're focused on making sure our customer sees one of our smart ways to save. It can be Dollar items. It can be private-brand items that are tied-in to a great value on a national brand end cap. Our ability to have cleaned up end caps now gives us the opportunity to do some of those things where we were not able to a year ago. Up and down the aisle, we want our customers to see a promise of great everyday low price. We want to make sure we're calling out our Dollar well. We've added a couple hundred Dollar items over the past year, but this is not about converting a Family Dollar into Dollar Tree. We have a great private-brand program that we're polishing up and enhancing. We want to make sure that on sale, we have the right national brand items in our ad that are driving traffic. So it's not just one tool we're using. We want to certainly be competitive as we measure the competition. But really, for our customer at Family Dollar, we have to really knit all those things together that we're describing in smart ways to save to execute very well around first-of-month, but then the balance of the month as well. Our customer shops differently at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. It's really something that I think is unique to Family Dollar, with the customer base we serve. We're getting smarter on how they respond on both promotions and then what we show in store. So that's the work that we're working very hard to get smarter on and improve our sales trajectory out with [ph]."

We're also looking at engineered standards and doing a lot of work, and especially in the Dollar Tree banner, as we bring these 2 companies together on engineered standards. So a lot of foundational work is being done right now with 22 distribution centers. So the idea of planning for capacity needs as we're continuing to grow is a high priority. So we're spending time on what do we need going forward based on our growth, number one. And number two, the integration and how do we put these 2 banners together to better serve not only the new growth, but also the existing businesses. So lots of things are going on with St. George. It was the first one. It's only been a couple months, few months. I think June, I guess, is when we brought that up. And there's some refinements that they're in process of doing on that. But we have been able -- we've done the hard work of integrating and shipping both banners out of one distribution center. That gives us the ability going forward to take advantage of capacity and the system no matter where it exists by using it for both banners. It gives us the ability to reduce our stem miles in the future. So that we -- if we can deliver both banners out of the same DCs, then certainly, we can get the best stem miles. So there's a lot of payback there, but it is taking a little time on integration because of technology. We're continuing to grow, and we're not going to miss anything there. We still have to continue to provide capacity as we continue to grow. And frankly, the engineered standards work that we're doing is really, really important to us as we go forward and combine these 2 banners and combine these 2 networks, doing it the most efficient way and reducing cost per building is a big idea. So we're working really hard on it. The time line is still a little bit in flux. I will tell you that we're going to probably -- I'm sure we're going to beat our synergy estimates on the supply chain in the 3 years as we said. I can't tell you how much."

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we've owned the Family Dollar business for a full 3 months in the prior year's comparable quarter. Our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015. Total sales for the third quarter increased 1.1% to $5 billion. As a reminder, third quarter results last year includes sales from 325 Family Dollar stores that were divested after the end of the quarter. Same-store sales on the constant currency basis increased 1.7%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increased with 1.8%. Operating income increased 53.1% to $342.4 million. Net income for the quarter increased 109.4% to $171.6 million, and GAAP earnings per share were $0.72. Adjusting for $0.09 of expense incurred outside of guidance, that was associated with debt refinancing. Adjusted EPS was $0.81 and near the top end of our guidance of $0.76 to $0.82 per diluted share.
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the third quarter. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments improved gross margin rate year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 230 basis points a 6.85% for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share were at the top end of our range of guidance.
The Dollar Tree banner continue to show strong consistent growth and we continue to make meaningful progress in the integration of Family Dollar. We remain on track to achieve our expected synergies target of $300 million and run rate by the end of the first 3 years. This includes improvements in direct and indirect procurement, rebannering of select stores and the development of our shared services model including supply chain and logistics. They is still much more to be done and I believe we will ultimately surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the third quarter included a total sales increase of 8.6%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% and this was achieved through increases in both traffic and average ticket.  Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points over last year. And operating margin was 11.6%, an improvement of 170 basis points over last year's 9.9%. Excluding acquisition related costs in the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points. To share some of the color on the quarter, top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner includes snacks and beverages, household products, seasonal toys and party supplies. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. While we continue to experience an estimated 80 basis points of incremental cannibalization resulting from the rebannering of 210 deal stores and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, we delivered positive same-store sales each month throughout the quarter.
And despite the calendar shift this year, which moved the last 2 days of October and Halloween sales from third quarter and into fourth quarter, we finished the third quarter strong. October was our highest comp month of the quarter. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth for the quarter was the strongest in the upper Midwest, the Southwest, the Northeast and the west zones. Also zones had positive comps with the exception of the Southeast, which was only slightly negative as it experienced a higher degree of incremental cannibalization from our rebanner initiative. The Dollar Tree business continued to be strong, consistent and growing.  This represented our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our third quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often and we continue to attract new customers every day and when these customers are in the store, they're buying more. Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budget. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customer better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store, everyday. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and privileged shopping experience and seasonal energy was high beginning in August with back-to-school.
In addition to dominant displays of back-to-school basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationery, teacher supplies, classroom residuals and lunchbox values, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 30th anniversary with and well items for our customers. Key categories including cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and abroad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event. 
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from back-to-school to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquartered with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party suppliers. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over the prior year.  We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the Thanksgiving, Christmas and the fourth quarter holiday shopping season. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment has positioned for increased relevance to our customers to sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and through increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the third quarter, we opened a total of 101 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated and expanded 15 Dollar Tree stores and we rebannered 42 additional Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree's for a total of 158 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter.
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 8% compared to the prior year and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,320 Dollar Tree stores across North America. I continue to be pleased with our rebannering efforts. Since the acquisition, our store development teams have rebannered 210 deal stores to Dollar Tree and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 495 new Dollar Tree stores. We ended our third quarter this year with a total of 565 more Dollar Tree stores than the same time one year ago.
These new and newly rebannered stores are performing very well in terms of sales and improved operating margin. While the right decision for the long-term and the near term, we continue to bear incremental cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 basis points. This headwind will dissipate each quarter towards the end of 2017, as we cycle the convergence from the prior year. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive to business initiatives include category expansion, the customers realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and IKEA as well as home and household products. Creating a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance.
Our store first change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill to hunt throughout the store that Dollar Tree always find an unexpected value. And number four, being first to the month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekends, and especially, at the beginning of each month, when many customers are shopping for basic needs. We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. Into the third quarter, we installed fridges and coolers in 154 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,710 stores with plans to continue growing. With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create shareholder value as a combined organization. I continue to be as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are deploying a disciplined approach to building the foundation for the long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business for the present, we are developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priority."

For Q3, the Family Dollar banner had low single-digit negative same-store sales. However, August was slightly positive. September was our weakest comp during the quarter. And remember last year, we had kicked off our Red Tag currency event mid-month. October was also negative as weed cycle the completion of our currency ramp last year. And of course, the impact of Halloween in first month shifting money end of the quarter.

So for Family Dollar, it's a great way to reach a demographic overlap that serves us as well and really bring additional credibility to our smart ways to save.
Another fundamental part of our strategy for success is our focus on table sticks. At a high level, this includes improved store standards and conditions. Neat, clean, fully recovered. Merchandising relevance and energy, finding what they need at Family Dollar and at a value I recognize. And customer engagement, what we call Family Dollar friendly.

Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.23% of $5.32 billion. Year-over-year sales comparison been impacted negatively by the loss of sales from 297 stores, which we rebannered as Dollar Tree stores in addition to the 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% versus 2.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization of 80 basis points from 507 Family Dollar and deal stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.8%.
All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and deal stores are considered new stores and were excluded from our same-store sales calculation in Q3. Gross profit for the combined organization increased 8.6% to $1.52 billion for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 30.4% versus 28.3% in the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.8% during the third quarter, and 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's third quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight cost of higher initial mark on, especially offset by higher distribution and occupancy cost as a percent of net sales.
On a GAAP basis, gross profit for the Family Dollar segment increased to 5.6% to $663.2 million. Gross profit margins for Family Dollar segment was 26.2% during the third quarter compared with 23.5% in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the inventory step up amortization of $38.4 million and markdowns of $13 million in the prior year -- prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.2% for the quarter compared with an adjusted 25.4% in the prior year's quarter. The improvement is due to lower merchandise, freight, and shrink cost, partially offset by higher markdown expense and increased occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization decreased to 23.6% from 23.8% in the same quarter last year as a percent of net sales. 
Excluding $11.8 million of 25 basis points of acquisition-related expenses in 2015, the SG&A rate remained consistent at 23.6%.
Increases in store hourly payrolls as a percentage of net sales were offset by lower professional fees and lower depreciation expense as a percentage of sales. Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.2%, a 90 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $11.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's acquisition related cost, SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points to 23.2% of sales from 23.6% of sales.

Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales to 23.8% from 23.3% in the prior year.

Operating income margin increased to 6.8% for the quarter from 4.5% in the last year's third quarter.

Excluding the $11.8 million in acquisition related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 11.6% compared to an adjusted 10.4% of sales in the prior year third quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating income for Family Dollar segment increased $57.5 million or 2.2% as a percent of net sales. Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $112.2 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense as well as $26.6 million of acceleration of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million or fees associated with our debt refinancing. Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.5% compared to 34.3% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016 of $21.4 million or $0.09 per share related to a 1% decrease in North Carolina's state tax rate, which decreased the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible assets as well as the adoption of ASGU number 2016 -- '09 under which, the incremented tax benefit recognized the restricted stock income tax expense.
For the third quarter, the company had GAAP net income of $171.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $733.8 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015.

Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 8.5% greater than at the same time, last year, while selling square foot increased 8.2%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 0.4%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter.
Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 2.1% from the same period last year an increased 0.7% on a selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on the in stock level on key items. We continue to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $95.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $169.5 million in the third quarter of last year. 
For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $620 million to $650 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores, models including fee development stores, our rebanner initiatives, edition of frozen refrigerator capability to approximately $400 stores, IT enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $157.6 million for the third quarter. This includes purchase accounting related costs of $18.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization. Depreciation expense was $168.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This includes $17.9 million for Q4 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting evaluation of Family Dollar leases. 
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions: beginning in Q4, our acquired Family Dollar stores will be included in our reported same-store sales; in 2016, the last 2 days of October, our last Halloween sale day shifted into our fourth quarter. This shift is included in our sales guidance. Our 2 additional sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas between 2016. We will continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned in fact to gain both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales.
We have budgeted lower freight, import freight costs than a year ago. And our interest expense will be approximately $79 million in Q4. Our Q4 and full year guidance includes an impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect on December 1. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.3% for the fourth quarter and 33% for fiscal 2016. 
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.1 million shares in Q4 and $236.7 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.59 billion to $5.69 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.24 to $1.33, an increase from prior implied guidance of $1.21 to $1.30. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increases in both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.9%.
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales in the range between $20.67 billion and $20.77 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.69 billion and $20.87 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016, in a range between $3.67 and $3.77 -- $30.76, which includes the effect of $0.09 refinancing cost in the third quarter. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.67 to $3.82, which did not include any refinancing costs. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase of 3.9% square footage growth.

Again, I'm very pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. We are making meaningful progress in developing, what I consider to be the best model in small box value retail. Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of  6,000 store banner and an 8,000 store banner, each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers across all types of markets. With the combination of these 2 great brands, we have powerful flexibility in how and where we choose to grow, while expanding our opportunity to grow. Across the combined banners, we will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long term shareholders. 
Retailers in ever-changing environment. Overtime we've demonstrated our management team's ability to be agile and nimble to effectively adapt to the changing environment. As discussed on prior calls, we have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new FLSA regulations. We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1st. As always, we will continue to employ a disciplined approach to drive in key strategic initiatives to the combined organization, to improve communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.
We are confident that placing our initial emphasis on these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, control and greater customer satisfaction. The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful flexible, more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to the customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 35 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. There are good times and difficult times. In all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value, no matter what the state of the economy. While our price remains a dollar, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. In the third quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.6%, same-store sales increased 1.7% and operating margin improved to 11.6%.
Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree. Operator, we are now ready for the questions."

And then we went against the Red Tag current event both in September and October. So wasn't able to overcome some of the traffic. I think the Silver line for me was that the basket lift that we got last year struck with us this year. And then I would tell you November is starting off how I would hope, going into the holiday season. So I start with saying the foundation that we are building around value, the marketing program, the table stakes, those are the things that we knew we had to do going in just to build foundation. Anything else we're going to do past that, we have to stick, because we're consistent on delivering value on the store. We have a shopping experience that our customers find value when they come to the door of a Family Dollar. Long term, what's going to change. While we continue to have the opportunities in front of us that we can enhance by brands and course and we can do more direct imports, but we still have a store base that has wonderful opportunity for us to take a look and figure out how we continue to renovate, put in new assortments, expand the elements in our stores that our customers are looking for.
When we see our first month business on SNEP for instance, some modest changes that drive business to our frozen food, resonate very well with our customers. So the work so far has been around the foundation that allows us to long-term deploy capital in a meaningful way into our existing store base along with new stores that will create different flow for our customers as we comes in. And sees more seasonal merchandise, sees more elements that drive a higher sales per square foot productivity because of our assortment expansions. So that's the work ahead of us. I would tell you that up to this point, we've been very focused on just driving the foundational pieces of our business that we had to fix it. And while we are not all the way there, I would tell you we've made progress and it's still lot focus as we go into 2017."

Because if you think about the number of the stores that we rebannered as part of that, that's been a fairly large cost at the end of the day. But we probably spend more, like I said CapEx than OpEx. But I still think the $300 million hold true. What I don't know exactly at this moment is will it may be be 60% CapEx at the end of the day as opposed to 50%. I think there could be a little bit of movement in that direction as we think about, not only rebanners, but the systems integration and various other projects. We got 1 D.C. that we co-bannered, so a lot of things that we have done have required capital dollars to make those changes.

Obviously, a very strong gross profit in the quarter with improvement of 80 basis points. And again, low freight cost, better mark on. Obviously, our merchant team has been doing a great job continuing to source unbelievable values at the $1 price point. And obviously, it's been a little bit of a buyer's market to a certain extent on the discretionary side for the foreign purchases, so that's always helpful. But again, what we always do is we manage that. We have to make sure that we're credit providing a value to the consumer at dollar price point and something that we've been able to go. Freight in itself has been a benefit. I would tell you couple of things. One, Q4 is the quarter in which we see basically a flip where diesel will not be a benefit. In the fourth quarter, diesel will be a slight headwind in the fourth quarter compared to last year where the pricing was. We have import benefits through our contract, which goes through the end of the April. But obviously, that landscape is changing as well as we go forward so we have to keep that in mind.
But so -- but I would tell you, I would think from a fourth quarter, we would expect to see our gross margin continue to expand in the Dollar Tree banner. On the SG&A side of the equation, we saw some various pieces as I spoke to in the sense of lower cost for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs. But we also had investment store payroll. So we do believe it's important. We will continue to invest in store payroll as we go forward. We believe it's important aspect of running good stores that our customers expect as you go forward and the conditions and merchandised and full front-end friendly. So we think that will continue. But I'd say there is opportunity on the SG&A on an overall basis, but I think probably gross profit is a little bit bigger potential. When you look at Family Dollar, Family Dollar on a GAAP basis basically improved from a flat operating margin 2.2 operating margin for the quarter. I think you have a lot of different moving pieces. On an adjusted basis, you saw improvement in the gross profit line items. And really again, we saw improvement in Marcon, improvement in freight, improvement in shrink. And I think those are areas we think we can continue to improve upon.
And I would tell you that one of the call ups was higher markdown, but I think that the somewhat -- that is really a condition of last year. If you remember in Q2 last year, we took $60 million reserve from markdowns for the red tag clearance that happened in Q3. So we are able to take that reserve to offset some of those markdowns in Q3. So our Q3 markdowns last year probably a little below what they would be on a normal run-rate basis. So that was not unexpected at the end of the day. On an SG&A basis, I think one of the things we have going on is we do have a geography change going on in the Family Dollar P&L between merchandised margin and advertising. So we are getting -- we are taking -- we are not taking co op dollars. We are getting at net cost up front from the product. So we are seeing an increase in advertising, which was called out in my comments -- prepared comments and that will continue as we go forward.
So but otherwise, we've also had store payroll investments as well in Family Dollar. So some puts and takes there as well. But on a go forward basis, we do expect there may be some investments there but I would expect that depreciation and amortization on the Family Dollar banner will continue to decrease as we cycled through the comparisons of the harmonization of depreciation policies and the favorable lease rate. So some of the long wind today answered puts and takes"

And we have cleaned up obviously from a year ago, really the merchandise did not have a home and they tended to collect on NCAPs. So our ability to put in front of the customer what she wants on a weekly, monthly and during the holiday basis is by far the biggest difference that you're going to see at a Family Dollar. The tweaks that you see on assortments going up and down the aisles really reflect around what we think our customer, is most interested in and that reflects around our basics and things like candy in our consumable business including frozen food, which drives traffic. In our discretionary business, we still have a strong apparel business on ladies that is seasonally relevant and driven by cold-weather, which looks like we are finally going to get a good as we go into Thanksgiving holiday. And just around the seasonal displays and impact, much like you see sometimes that the Dollar Tree, the things our customers need in the last few days going up to holiday, family Dollar shopper shops so much later in the season that our ability to get ready for that and to have those displays on the floor or on the shelf are very important for us.
All that being said, I would tell you the biggest lever of Family Dollar to add at the beginning of this process was just getting in stock.

Really a lot of our focus is what's happening to us from the first to 10th of the month and that is where we saw a nice impact on first 2 months. And we've been able to sustain that kind of activity through the additional weeks. Big week in front of us, obviously, but we are going into the very mead of the holiday, obviously, this week and kickoff on Thursday, going to the balance of quarter into Christmas. And then we'll keep our fingers crossed on weather. Both that we should have just the right amount of cold-weather to sell all of our apparel that we need and not too much snow that people can't get to stores. 
That being said, what's the biggest opportunity, I would say besides the basics I've mentioned on being in stock and compelling values, is then renovation of some of our store base. Because we are still at risk on the older stores at Family Dollar that require either perhaps some big deferred maintenance, but maybe even more than that gain the right assortment in the store with the right amount of square footage for each of the departments. And that's where we see the perhaps long-term driver sustain confident in Family Dollar to that's the basics in retail of having the right assortment and part of that is how has it set up in each of our stores. So when you take a look at the Family Dollar fleet, it works against us right now, where we have a large fleet of older stores.

I don't know I can say how I thought that about from the beginning to now. I think what we've gotten the benefit of is the work on synergy has given us the ability to see that -- when you take a look at the margin expansion at Family Dollar, a good piece of that is a synergy work. Another good chunk of that is what we just do at Family Dollar in terms of auctioning and gaining the best cost and as markets go up and down, making sure we are getting true net cost. I think the synergy work over the long term will give us flexibility. So when we said $300 million, I think we've all said we would be disappointed if that's all we ended up. So the flexibility that, that gives us in Family Dollar is to say where should we invest it now. We went into that we had deferred maintenance in CapEx to put into the stores.  We are on them -- we've been following that model. It's a sequenced in a way that gives us a biggest feedback. We've invested in store labor because we just needed to give our customer better shopping experience, but that was -- that's proceeding as we projected. So I don't know that it changed from what we thought. It certainly, never quite goes may be as fast as I would like to see it happen, but I feel that we are on track with the things, with the big levers that we start with at Family Dollar. We have stayed focused on and stayed true to. And at the end of the day staying focused on what our customers will give us credit for.

I'm not caught up in the SKU count, it's certainly a piece of it as much as it is on how I'm going to drive productivity and profitability 4 feet x 4 feet to teh store. So while the 2 are related, I really think the little bit of it is, how do I get the right assortment at Family Dollar across these categories. You'll see some additional expansions in the future on some categories. But clearly, we had an opportunity to just get ourselves looking through the lens of value from our customer to have the right assortment at Family Dollar. The in-stock piece what we related is the opportunity for us just to make sure that we are in stock, on shelf for our customer.

So we've made a lot of progress on our smart ways to say everyday low price, as Gary says, throughout the store sale items, frequent sale items, our dollar in our stores, it's not a Dollar Tree. But we have a dollar while section in our Family Dollar stores, it has gained a lot of traction. Our price drop program continues to find traction and interest from the customers. Our shopping compared with our private label and the newest one is our digital coupon, as Gary said, in a short period of time we had over a million customers signed up for. So just that idea of engaging with our customers, the store matches the ad, the ad matches the store. When a customer comes in, there is an expectation of being in business, finding what they need. May not be as SKUs, it's a big-box guys. We don't have room for everything. But what we have is what our customers expect to have and we have it in stock everyday as well as other items. So I look at the competition always and I'm very much as we are all a student of retailing. But at the end of the day, all of our actions are focused on the customer and executing our plan to that customer. We are going to be competitive. We're going to be appropriately competitive. We're going to shop the market, but we're looking for more ways to engage the customer to offer even more value than our competitors offer. That takes a little time. But frankly, I think, we are right on target with that. And the building of the foundation that we will expand into the future, for years into the future, I think that's one of the most important things that we can do as a retailer, just build this Family Dollar business, so it survives any -- there is always going to be a price issue here, there. There is always going to be emphasis on one category or the other. What will stand the test time is how we are serving our customers, offering the best product at the best price and the shopping executive that they"

We lost service from our Savannah distribution center for days because we couldn't get workers to the D.C. in order to serve. We were servicing stores in that area out of our South Carolina Distribution Center for example and for Dollar Tree. So our store teams and our logistic teams and everyone just did a fabulous job in a really difficult time. That was a category for came all the way from Florida to Virginia, because did have a lot of people and created a lot of issues. So out of that, we had some extra markdowns because we lost some electricity. We lost a few stores out of that. You see the results though and it's really -- it did not bring us to our knees. It did not cripple us. Our people just did a fabulous job on really scrambling to continue to serve the customers in the best way possible.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we've owned the Family Dollar business for a full 3 months in the prior year's comparable quarter. Our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015.
Total sales for the third quarter increased 1.1% to $5 billion. As a reminder, third quarter results last year included sales from 325 Family Dollar stores that were divested after the end of the quarter. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.8%. Operating income increased 53.1% to $342.4 million. Net income for the quarter increased 109.4% (sic) [ 109.5% ] to $171.6 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.72. Adjusting for $0.09 of expense incurred outside of guidance, that was associated with debt refinancing, adjusted EPS was $0.81 and near the top end of our guidance of $0.76 to $0.82 per diluted share.
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the third quarter. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments improved gross margin rate year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 230 basis points to 6.85% for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share were at the top end of our range of guidance.
The Dollar Tree banner continues to show strong consistent growth, and we continue to make meaningful progress in the integration of Family Dollar. We have remained on track to achieve our expected synergies target of $300 million and run rate by the end of the first 3 years. This includes improvements in direct and indirect procurement, rebannering of select stores and the development of our shared services model including supply chain and logistics. There is still much more to be done, and I believe, we will, ultimately, surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the third quarter included a total sales increase of 8.6%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% and this was achieved through increases in both traffic and average ticket.  Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points over last year. And operating margin was 11.6%, an improvement of 170 basis points over last year's 9.9%. Excluding acquisition-related costs in the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points. To share some of the color on the quarter, top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner include snacks and beverages, household products, seasonal toys and party supplies. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. While we continue to experience an estimated 80 basis points of incremental cannibalization resulting from the rebannering of 210 deal stores and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, we delivered positive same-store sales each month throughout the quarter. And despite the calendar shift this year, which moved the last 2 days of October and Halloween sales from third quarter and into fourth quarter, we finished the third quarter strong. October was our highest comp month of the quarter. 
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth for the quarter was strongest in the upper Midwest, the Southwest, the Northeast and the West zones. All zones had positive comps with the exception of the Southeast, which was only slightly negative as it experienced a higher degree of incremental cannibalization from our rebanner initiative. The Dollar Tree business continued to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our third quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day and when these customers are in the store, they're buying more.
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store, every day. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience and seasonal energy was high beginning in August with Back-to-School.
In addition to dominant displays of Back-to-School basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationery, teacher supplies, classroom residuals and lunchbox values, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 30th anniversary with Bonus Buys and well items for our customers. Key categories including cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event.
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from Back-to-School to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over the prior year. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the Thanksgiving, Christmas and the fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers with sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and through increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the third quarter, we opened a total of 101 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated and expanded 15 Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 42 additional Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree's for a total of 158 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter.
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 8% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,320 Dollar Tree stores across North America. I continue to be pleased with our rebannering efforts. Since the acquisition, our store development teams have rebannered 210 deal stores to Dollar Tree and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 495 new Dollar Tree stores. We ended our third quarter this year with a total of 565 more Dollar Tree stores than the same time one year ago. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing very well in terms of sales and improved operating margin. While the right decision for the long term and the near term, we continue to bear incremental cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 basis points. This headwind will dissipate each quarter towards the end of 2017, as we cycle the convergence from the prior year.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive to business initiatives include category expansion. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eye care as well as home and household products.
Creating a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our stores first change with the season. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill to hunt throughout the store that Dollar Tree always finds an unexpected value. And number four, being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekends, and especially, at the beginning of each month, when many customers are shopping for basic needs. We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 154 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,710 stores with plans to continue growing.
With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create shareholder value as a combined organization. I continue to be as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are deploying a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business for the present, we are developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priority."

Our focus at Family Dollar is around the customer-facing initiatives that our customers continue to give us credit for. And we are working hard to improve these across our base of 8,000 stores. Our customers are seeing cleaner, better merchandised stores that have more compelling end cap with price they need for everyday basics and holiday needs. While we have more to do here, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the business basics of the Family Dollar banner.
For Q3, the Family Dollar banner had low single-digit negative same-store sales. However, August was slightly positive. September was our weakest comp during the quarter. And remember last year, we had kicked off our Red Tag Clearance Event mid-month. October was also negative as we cycled the completion of our clearance event last year. And of course, the impact of Halloween in first of the month, shifting money end of the quarter.
However, we did see an acceleration of our 2-year stack comp of greater than 100 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And our Q3 basket improved slightly against a negative transactions for the quarter, primarily from the clearance event last year. Our consumable business at Family Dollar outperformed our discretionary business. And geographically, our West and Mid-Atlantic regions were the strongest performing areas of the country for us.
In real estate, we opened 52 new Family Dollar stores, we relocated or expanded 24 Family Dollar stores for a total of 76 projects, we rebannered 42 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and we ended the quarter with nearly 8,000 Family Dollar stores, 7964 to be exact. We will achieve by year-end our target of 200 new Family Dollar stores for the year. And together with Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners, we now have a total of over 14,000 store locations -- 14,284 across the U.S. and Canada.
At Family Dollar, our customer-facing programs continue to drive and show value throughout the store, as we build momentum with our smart ways to save marketing program. Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all of our foundations on delivering value for our Family Dollar customers. These simple ways to save reflect from our ad into our store and these show our customers EDLP; pricing on every day values; our sale items that reflect the most meaningful values on key items; Dollar well, which drives a surprise in opening price point throughout the store, compare and save to show really our excellent values on our private brands; price drop, which is our great savings passed on to our customers above and beyond. And during the quarter, we completed our national rollout of smart coupons. Our customers have responded positively with above projection sign-ups from our Labor Day kickoff. We already have over 1 million customers who have signed up. For our customers, it completes a ""no-hassle shopping"" experience to find national and Family Dollar exclusive offers. Also, we added emphasis to our ""smart ways of save"" strategy with the kickoff on the CW Network of our partnership of a 30-minute game show called SAVE TO WIN. Our host of the show, Pat Neely, highlights the great product expense throughout the Family Dollar across a high-energy fund format that fits competing real Family Dollar shoppers against each other.
So for Family Dollar, it's a great way to reach a demographic overlap that serves us well and really bring additional credibility to our smart ways to save.
Another fundamental part of our strategy for success is our focus on table sticks. At a high level, this includes improved store standards and conditions; neat, clean, full, recovered; merchandising relevance and energy; finding what they need at Family Dollar and at a value I recognize; and customer engagement, what we call Family Dollar-friendly. Our customers count on us all month long, but the first 10 days of the month at Family Dollar are critical in their efforts to be in stock, recovered and end caps with the compelling offers. Our focus here revolves around our efforts to have improved direct-to-store delivery, support and service along with our operational teams improving our truck-to-shelf process. The convenience of our stores combined with our focus on improvements across our customer-facing initiatives is the foundation for our improved customer experience at Family Dollar.
Our investment across our business is measured with the test and learn discipline to measure our success and to involve our next up initiatives just like a Dollar Tree. So while we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to be the best at delivering value to our customers that are unique in many ways and often underserved. Our stores serve a customer that counts on us and responds when we deliver value, customer service and a Family Dollar shopping experience that we are all proud of in the neighborhoods we serve.
Now, let me turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our third quarter performance and our updated outlook on Q4 and the full year. Kevin?"

Total sales for the third quarter grew 1.1% to $5 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion. Year-over-year sales compa",1641,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Total sales for the third quarter grew 1.1% to $5 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted negatively by the loss of sales from 297 stores, which we rebannered as Dollar Tree stores, in addition to the 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% versus 2.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization of 80 basis points from the 507 Family Dollar and deal stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.8%.
All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and deal stores are considered new stores and were excluded from our same-store sales calculation in Q3. Gross profit for the combined organization increased 8.6% to $1.52 billion for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 30.4% versus 28.3% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.8% during the third quarter, and 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's third quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales.
On a GAAP basis, gross profit for the Family Dollar segment increased to 5.6% to $663.2 million. Gross profit margins for Family Dollar segment was 26.2% during the third quarter compared with 23.5% in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $38.4 million and markdowns of $13 million in the prior year -- prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.2% for the quarter compared with an adjusted 25.4% in the prior year's quarter. The improvement is due to lower merchandise, freight and shrink costs, partially offset by higher markdown expense and increased occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization decreased to 23.6% from 23.8% in the same quarter last year as a percent of net sales. Excluding $11.8 million or 25 basis points of acquisition-related expenses in 2015, the SG&A rate remained consistent at 23.6%.  Increases in store hourly payrolls as a percent of net sales were offset by lower professional fees and lower depreciation expense, as a percent of sales. Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.2%, a 90 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $11.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related costs, SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points to 23.2% of sales from 23.6% of sales. The improvement was driven by lower cost as a percent of sales for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs, partially offset by higher store payroll expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment was $606.8 million. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 24% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.8 million for severance benefits, while the prior year's comparable period included $6.8 million of acquisition-related and divestiture cost. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales to 23.8% from 23.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher store payroll, health insurance and advertising costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense.
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $342.4 million compared with $223.7 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 6.8% for the quarter from 4.5% in the last year's third quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 170 basis points to 11.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $11.8 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 11.6% compared to an adjusted 10.4% of sales in the prior year third quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $57.5 million, to 2.2% as a percent of net sales. Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $112.2 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense as well as $26.6 million of acceleration of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million of fees associated with our debt refinancing. Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.5% compared to 34.3% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016 of $21.4 million or $0.09 per share related to a 1% decrease in North Carolina's state tax rate, which decreased the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset, as well as the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, under which the incremental tax benefit recognized the Dollar's restricted stock vested as reported in the income tax expense.
For the third quarter, the company had GAAP net income of $171.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $733.8 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the end of the third quarter of 2015. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 8.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 8.2%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 0.4%.
We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end decreased 2.1% from the same period last year and increased 0.7% on a selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing at in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $95.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $169.5 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $620 million to $650 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels including fee development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the edition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects, and our distribution center projects.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $157.6 million for the third quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization. Depreciation expense was $168.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This includes $17.9 million for Q4 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting evaluation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions:. Beginning in Q4, our acquired Family Dollar stores will be included in our reported same-store sales. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales day shifted into our fourth quarter. This shift is included in our sales guidance. Our 2 additional sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower freight -- import freight costs than a year ago. And our interest expense will be approximately $79 million in Q4.
Our Q4 and full year guidance includes an impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect December 1. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.3% for the fourth quarter and 33% for fiscal 2016.
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.1 million shares in Q4 and 236.7 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.59 billion to $5.69 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.24 to $1.33, an increase from prior implied guidance of $1.21 to $1.30. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increases in both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.9%.
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales in a range between $20.67 billion and $20.77 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.69 billion and $20.87 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.77 -- $3.76, which includes the effect of $0.09 refinancing costs in the third quarter. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.67 to $3.82, which did not include any refinancing costs. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase of 3.9% square footage growth.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

Again, I'm very pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. We are making meaningful progress in developing, what I consider to be, the best model in small-box value retail. Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of a 6,000 store banner and an 8,000 store banner, each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers across all types of markets. With the combination of these 2 great brands, we have powerful flexibility in how and where we choose to grow, while expanding our opportunity to grow. Across the combined banners, we will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders.
Retailers in ever-changing environment, over time we've demonstrated our management team's ability to be agile and nimble to effectively adapt to the changing environment. As discussed on prior calls, we have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new FLSA regulations. We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1. As always, we will continue to employ a disciplined approach to drive in key strategic initiatives to the combined organization, to improve communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.
We are confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to the customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.
For 35 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. There are good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value, no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. In the third quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.6%, same-store sales increased 1.7% and operating margin improved to 11.6%.
Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.
Operator, we are now ready for the questions."

The opportunity is just as big as we saw at the beginning. And as Bob said, we've remained just as enthusiastic. A little bit of, when you take a look at the opportunity showed itself in the quarter and even though we were slightly negative for the quarter, August was positive. And then we went against the Red Tag Clearance Event both in September and October. So it wasn't able to overcome some of the traffic. I think the silver lining for me was that the basket lift that we got last year stuck with us this year. And then I would tell you November is starting off how I would hope, going into the holiday season. So I start with saying the foundation that we are building around value, the marketing program, the table stakes, those are the things that we knew we had to do going in just to build the foundation. Anything else we're going to do past that, we have to stick, because we're consistent on delivering value in the store, and we have a shopping experience that our customers find value when they come to the door of a Family Dollar. Long term, what's going to change? While we continue to have the opportunities in front of us that we can enhance by our brands, of course, and we can do more direct imports, but we still have a store base that has wonderful opportunity for us to take a look and figure out how we continue to renovate, put in new assortments, expand the elements in our stores that our customers are looking for. When we see our first-of-the-month business on SNAP for instance, some modest changes that drive business to our frozen food, resonate very well with our customers. So the work so far has been around the foundation that allows us to long-term deploy capital in a meaningful way into our existing store base along with new stores that will create different flow for our customers as she comes in and sees more seasonal merchandise, sees more elements that drive a higher sales per square foot productivity because of our assortment expansions. So that's the work ahead of us. I would tell you that up to this point, we've been very focused on just driving the foundational pieces of our business that we had to fix. And while we are not all the way there, I would tell you we've made progress and it's still our focus as we go into '17."

But I still think the $300 million hold true. What I don't know exactly at this moment is will it maybe be 60% CapEx at the end of the day as opposed to 50%. I think there is -- could be a little bit of movement in that direction as we think about, not only rebanners, but the systems integration and various other projects. We have got one D.C. that we co-bannered, so a lot of things that we have done have required capital dollars to make those changes.

The -- so as we look at it, we look at the Dollar Tree banner, obviously, very strong gross profit during the quarter with improvement of 80 basis points. And, again, low freight costs, better mark-on. Obviously, our merchant team has been doing a great job continuing to source unbelievable values at the $1 price point. And obviously, it's been a little bit of a buyer's market to a certain extent on the discretionary side for the foreign purchases, so that's always helpful. But again, what we always do is we manage that. We have to make sure that we're credit, providing a value to the consumer at that dollar price point and something that we've been able to go. You know freight in itself has been a benefit. I would tell you a couple of things. One, Q4 is the quarter in which we see basically a flip where diesel will not be a benefit in the fourth quarter. Diesel will actually be a slight headwind in the fourth quarter compared to last year than where the pricing was. We have import benefits through our contract, which goes through the end of the April. But obviously, that landscape is changing as well as we go forward, so we have to keep that in mind. But so -- but I would tell you, I would think for the fourth quarter, we would expect to see our gross profit continue to expand in the Dollar Tree banner. On the SG&A side of the equation, we saw some various moving pieces as I spoke to in the sense of lower costs for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs and -- but we also had investment store payroll. So we do believe it's important. We will continue to invest in store payroll as we go forward. We believe it's important aspect of running good stores that our customers expect as we go forward and the conditions and merchandised and full, fun and friendly. So we think that will continue. But I'd say there is opportunity on the SG&A on an overall basis, but I think probably gross profit is a little bit bigger potential. When you look at Family Dollar, Family Dollar on a GAAP basis basically improved from a flat operating margin to a 2.2 operating margin for the quarter. I think you have a lot of different moving pieces. On an adjusted basis, you saw improvement in the gross profit line items. And really, again, we saw improvement in mark-on, improvement in freight, improvement in shrink. And I think those are areas we think we can continue to improve upon. And I would tell you that one of the call ups was higher markdown, but I think that the somewhat -- that is really a condition of last year. If you remember in Q2 last year, we took $60 million reserve from markdowns for the Red Tag Clearance Event which then happened in Q3. So our -- we are able to take that reserve to offset some of those markdowns in Q3. So our Q3 markdowns last year are probably a little below what they would be on a normal run-rate basis. So that's -- that was not unexpected at the end of the day. On an SG&A basis, I think one of the things we have going on is we do have a geography change going on in the Family Dollar P&L between merchandised margin and advertising. So we are getting -- we are taking -- we are not taking co-op dollars. We are getting at net costs upfront from the product. So we are seeing an increase in advertising, which was called out in my comments -- prepared comments and that will continue as we go forward. So -- but otherwise, we've also had store payroll investments as well in Family Dollar. So some puts and takes there as well. But on a go-forward basis, we do expect there, maybe, some investments there but I would expect that depreciation and amortization on the Family Dollar banner will continue to decrease as we've cycled through the comparisons of the harmonization of depreciation policies and the favorable lease rate. So somewhat of a long wind [ph] to the answer, but that's kind of the puts and takes, Paul, that I see."

And so our ability to put in front of the customer what she wants on a weekly, monthly and during the holiday basis is by far the biggest difference that you're going to see at a Family Dollar. The tweaks that you see on assortments going up and down the aisles really reflect around what we think our customer is most interested in and that reflects around our basics and things like candy in our consumable business, including frozen food, which drives traffic; in our discretionary business; we still have a strong apparel business on ladies that is seasonally relevant and driven by cold weather, which looks like we are finally going to get a bit of as we go into Thanksgiving holiday. And just around the seasonal displays and impact, much like you see sometimes at Dollar Tree, the things our customers need in the last few days going up to holiday, Family Dollar shopper shops so much later in the season that our ability to get ready for that and to have those displays on the floor or on the shelf are very important for us. All that being said, I would tell you the biggest lever of Family Dollar to add at the beginning of this process was just getting in stock. And that's how we continue to work on every day of the week to make sure that we have it with support from our DST suppliers as well as what we're touching from the back door to our shelf."

Really a lot of our focus is what's happening to us from the 1st through the 10th of the month and that is where we saw a nice impact on first of month. And we've been able to sustain that kind of activity through the additional weeks. Big week in front of us, obviously. But I'd say it's -- we are going into the very meat of the holiday, obviously, this week and kickoff on Thursday, going to the balance of the quarter into Christmas. Then we'll keep our fingers crossed on weather. But that we'd have just the right amount of cold weather to sell all of our apparel that we need and not too much snow that people can't get to stores. That being said, what's the biggest opportunity, I would say, besides the basics I've mentioned on being in-stock and compelling values, is then renovation of some of our store base. Because we are still at risk on the older stores at Family Dollar that require either perhaps some deferred maintenance, but maybe even more than that gain the right assortment in the store with the right amount of square footage for each of the departments. And that's where we see the, perhaps, long term to drive a sustained comp in Family Dollar to -- that's the basics in retail about having the right assortment and part of that is how is it set up in each of our stores. So when you take a look at the Family Dollar fleet, it works against us right now, where we have a large fleet of older stores. The upside is once we get into them and renovate them, there is a long runway there for us to keep improvement across our store base."

I don't know I can say how I thought about from the beginning to now. I think what -- we've gotten the benefit of is the work on synergy has given us the ability to see that -- when you take a look at the margin expansion at Family Dollar, a good piece of that is a synergy work. Another good chunk of that is what we just do at Family Dollar in terms of auctioning and gaining the best cost and as markets go up and down, making sure we are gaining true net cost. I think the synergy work over the long term will give us flexibility. So when we said $300 million, I think we've all said we would be disappointed if that's all we ended up with. So the flexibility that, that gives us in Family Dollar is to say where should we invest it now. We went into knowing that we had deferred maintenance in CapEx to put into the stores. We are on a -- we've been following that model. It's a sequenced in a way that gives us a biggest feedback. We've invested in store labor because we just flatly needed to, to give our customer a better shopping experience, but that was -- that's proceeding as we projected. So I don't know that it's changed from what we thought. It, certainly, never quite goes maybe as fast as I would like to see it happen, but I'd -- I feel that we are on track with the things, with the big levers that we start with at Family Dollar. We have stayed focused on and stayed true to. And at the end of the day, staying focused on what our customers will give us credit for. And that's maybe the anchor that we went into this with and that's where we are today."

You mentioned the in-stocks being the most important lever. If I think back to the management of the business under the prior regime, one of the things that was tried various times was to change the SKU counts, increase the assortment in terms of total choice, particularly in HBA that was the category where they took assortment counts up, and then -- and so what I'm wondering, and this is partially based on visiting the stores and sometimes noting that the Family Dollar stores appear to have fewer items or choices than some comparable format retailers, where do you are think you are with the breadth of the assortment in the stores?

And we are going to take a look really 4 feet by 4 feet as what's the reason to have the offering that's in front of the customer and to have the right assortment. I'm not caught up in SKU count. It's certainly a piece of it as much as it is on how I'm going to drive productivity and profitability 4 feet by 4 feet through the store. And so, I -- while the 2 are related, I really think a little bit of it is, how do I get the right assortment at Family Dollar across these categories. You'll see some additional expansions in the future on some categories. But clearly, we had an opportunity to just get ourselves looking through the lens of value from our customer to have the right assortment at Family Dollar. The in-stock piece what we related is the opportunity for us just to make sure that we are in-stock, on shelf for our customer. And that's the work we are working very hard on to make sure that we have, especially the first 10 days of the month, we have the items that are most meaningful for our customers on the shelf.

From a Dollar Tree perspective as well as Family Dollar perspective, we've always see the highly competitive in our sector discount store sector. So it continues to be. We see a lot of activity out there, especially now with the big-box and the grocery stores, and especially, on the food side of the business. From the Dollar Tree side, we're pretty well insulated from that from the standpoint of -- our goal is to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and the ever-changing mix. So we don't always excel exactly the same items as some of the big-box retailers or even the Family Dollar small-box sector. So from the Family -- from the Dollar Tree side, we are -- we watch what the competitors are doing as always, but we're really focused on the customer and offering the best value there. That's about half of our business. The other half of our business is Family Dollar and more traditional type of the business, more is planogram, we sell lot more of the same things we ever sell. We've been watching that. As Gary said, we shop religiously for competition, whoever they may be across broad geography and very thoroughly, and we take that information and react to it accordingly. We are really keeping the focus on what's important to our customers. We want to do what's in the best interest of our customers with the offering. And offer more value in more ways. One of the things that Family Dollar, and I'm extremely excited about, that was touched on really maybe on the last question, was the things that we've done and how -- what may be -- has been accomplished. And one of the major accomplishments I see is our smart ways to save marketing program. It's -- you want -- the store is the ad, the store is what we are selling to our customers, more to it than just an item or a product. It's a shopping experience and it's an in-stock, in-store and it's the whole idea of your Family Dollar store and customer engagement in the stores. So we've made a lot of progress on our smart ways to save. Every day low price, as Gary says, throughout the store. Sale items, frequent sale items. Our Dollar well in our stores, it's not a Dollar Tree. But we have a Dollar well section in our Family Dollar stores. It has gained a lot of traction. Our price drop program continues to find traction and interest from the customers. Our shopping compare with our private label and the newest one is our digital coupon, as Gary said, in a short period of time we had over a million customers signed up for. So just that idea of engaging with our customers, the store matches the ad, the ad matches the store. When a customer comes in, there is an expectation of being in-stock, in business, finding what they need. May not be as many SKUs, it's a big-box guys. We don't have room for everything. But what we have is what our customers expect to have, and we have it in-stock every day as well as our ad items. So I look at the competition always, and I'm very much as we are all a student of retailing. But at the end of the day, all of our actions are focused on the customer and executing our plan to that customer. We are going to be competitive. We're going to be appropriately competitive. We're going to shop the market, but we're looking for more ways to engage the customer to offer even more value than our competitors offer. That takes a little time. But frankly, I think, we are right on target with that. And the building of the foundation that we will expand into the future -- for years into the future, I think that's one of the most important things that we can do as a retailer, just build this Family Dollar business, so that it survives any -- there is always going to be a price issue here, there. There is always going to be emphasis on one category or the other. What will stand the test time is how we are serving our customers, offering the best product at the best price and the shopping experience that they expect."

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we've owned the Family Dollar business for a full 3 months in the prior year's comparable",1467,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we've owned the Family Dollar business for a full 3 months in the prior year's comparable quarter. Our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015.
Total sales for the third quarter increased 1.1% to $5 billion. As a reminder, third quarter results last year included sales from 325 Family Dollar stores that were divested after the end of the quarter. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.8%. Operating income increased 53.1% to $342.4 million. Net income for the quarter increased 109.4% (sic) [ 109.5% ] to $171.6 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.72. Adjusting for $0.09 of expense incurred outside of guidance, that was associated with debt refinancing, adjusted EPS was $0.81 and near the top end of our guidance of $0.76 to $0.82 per diluted share.
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the third quarter. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments improved gross margin rate year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 230 basis points to 6.85% for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share were at the top end of our range of guidance.
The Dollar Tree banner continues to show strong consistent growth, and we continue to make meaningful progress in the integration of Family Dollar. We remain on track to achieve our expected synergies target of $300 million and run rate by the end of the first 3 years. This includes improvements in direct and indirect procurement, rebannering of select stores and the development of our shared services model including supply chain and logistics. There is still much more to be done, and I believe, we will, ultimately, surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the third quarter included a total sales increase of 8.6%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% and this was achieved through increases in both traffic and average ticket.  Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points over last year. And operating margin was 11.6%, an improvement of 170 basis points over last year's 9.9%. Excluding acquisition-related costs in the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points. To share some of the color on the quarter, top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner include snacks and beverages, household products, seasonal toys and party supplies. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. While we continue to experience an estimated 80 basis points of incremental cannibalization resulting from the rebannering of 210 deal stores and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, we delivered positive same-store sales each month throughout the quarter. And despite the calendar shift this year, which moved the last 2 days of October and Halloween sales from third quarter and into fourth quarter, we finished the third quarter strong. October was our highest comp month of the quarter. 
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth for the quarter was strongest in the upper Midwest, the Southwest, the Northeast and the West zones. All zones had positive comps with the exception of the Southeast, which was only slightly negative as it experienced a higher degree of incremental cannibalization from our rebanner initiative. The Dollar Tree business continued to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our third quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day and when these customers are in the store, they're buying more.
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store, every day. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience and seasonal energy was high beginning in August with Back-to-School.
In addition to dominant displays of Back-to-School basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationery, teacher supplies, classroom residuals and lunchbox values, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 30th anniversary with Bonus Buys and WOW! items for our customers. Key categories including cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event.
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from Back-to-School to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over the prior year. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the Thanksgiving, Christmas and the fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers with sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and through increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the third quarter, we opened a total of 101 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated and expanded 15 Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 42 additional Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree's for a total of 158 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter.
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 8% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,320 Dollar Tree stores across North America. I continue to be pleased with our rebannering efforts. Since the acquisition, our store development teams have rebannered 210 deal stores to Dollar Tree and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 495 new Dollar Tree stores. We ended our third quarter this year with a total of 565 more Dollar Tree stores than the same time one year ago. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing very well in terms of sales and improved operating margin. While the right decision for the long term and the near term, we continue to bear incremental cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 basis points. This headwind will dissipate each quarter through the end of 2017, as we cycle the convergence from the prior year.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive to business initiatives include category expansion. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eye care as well as home and household products.
Creating a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our stores fronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store that Dollar Tree always finds an unexpected value. And number four, being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekends, and especially, at the beginning of each month, when many customers are shopping for basic needs. We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 154 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,710 stores with plans to continue growing.
With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create shareholder value as a combined organization. I continue to be as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are deploying a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business for the present, we are developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priority."

And we are working ha",868,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. After 5 full quarters, we continue to make progress at Family Dollar. Our focus at Family Dollar is around the customer-facing initiatives that our customers continue to give us credit for. And we are working hard to improve these across our base of 8,000 stores. Our customers are seeing cleaner, better merchandised stores that have more compelling end cap with price they need for everyday basics and holiday needs. While we have more to do here, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the business basics of the Family Dollar banner.
For Q3, the Family Dollar banner had low single-digit negative same-store sales. However, August was slightly positive. September was our weakest comp during the quarter. And remember last year, we had kicked off our Red Tag Clearance Event mid-month. October was also negative as we cycled the completion of our clearance event last year. And of course, the impact of Halloween in first of the month, shifting money end of the quarter.
However, we did see an acceleration of our 2-year stack comp of greater than 100 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And our Q3 basket improved slightly against a negative transactions for the quarter, primarily from the clearance event last year. Our consumable business at Family Dollar outperformed our discretionary business. And geographically, our West and Mid-Atlantic regions were the strongest performing areas of the country for us.
In real estate, we opened 52 new Family Dollar stores, we relocated or expanded 24 Family Dollar stores for a total of 76 projects, we rebannered 42 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and we ended the quarter with nearly 8,000 Family Dollar stores, 7964 to be exact. We will achieve by year-end our target of 200 new Family Dollar stores for the year. And together with Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners, we now have a total of over 14,000 store locations -- 14,284 across the U.S. and Canada.
At Family Dollar, our customer-facing programs continue to drive and show value throughout the store, as we build momentum with our smart ways to save marketing program. Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all of our foundations on delivering value for our Family Dollar customers. These simple ways to save reflect from our ad into our store and these show our customers EDLP; pricing on every day values; our sale items that reflect the most meaningful values on key items; Dollar well, which drives a surprise in opening price point throughout the store, compare and save to shout-out really our excellent values on our private brands; price drop, which is our great savings passed on to our customers above and beyond. And during the quarter, we completed our national rollout of smart coupons. Our customers have responded positively with above projection sign-ups from our Labor Day kickoff. We already have over 1 million customers who have signed up. For our customers, it completes a ""no-hassle shopping"" experience to find national and Family Dollar exclusive offers. Also, we added emphasis to our ""smart ways of save"" strategy with the kickoff on the CW Network of our partnership of a 30-minute game show called SAVE TO WIN. Our host of the show, Pat Neely, highlights the great product expense throughout the Family Dollar across a high-energy fund format that fits competing real Family Dollar shoppers against each other.
So for Family Dollar, it's a great way to reach a demographic overlap that serves us well and really brings additional credibility to our smart ways to save.
Another fundamental part of our strategy for success is our focus on table sticks. At a high level, this includes improved store standards and conditions; neat, clean, full, recovered; merchandising relevance and energy; finding what I need at Family Dollar and at a value I recognize; and customer engagement, what we call Family Dollar-friendly. Our customers count on us all month long, but the first 10 days of the month at Family Dollar are critical in their efforts to be in stock, recovered and end caps with the compelling offers. Our focus here revolves around our efforts to have improved direct-to-store delivery, support and service along with our operational teams improving our truck-to-shelf process. The convenience of our stores combined with our focus on improvements across our customer-facing initiatives is the foundation for our improved customer experience at Family Dollar.
Our investment across our business is measured with the test and learn discipline to measure our success and to involve our next step initiatives just like at Dollar Tree. So while we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to be the best at delivering value to our customers that are unique in many ways and often underserved. Our stores serve a customer that counts on us and responds when we deliver value, customer service and a Family Dollar shopping experience that we are all proud of in the neighborhoods we serve.
Now, let me turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our third quarter performance and our updated outlook on Q4 and the full year. Kevin?"

Total sales for the third quarter grew 1.1% to $5 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion. Year-over-year sales compa",1641,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Total sales for the third quarter grew 1.1% to $5 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted negatively by the loss of sales from 297 stores, which we rebannered as Dollar Tree stores, in addition to the 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% versus 2.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization of 80 basis points from the 507 Family Dollar and deal stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.8%.
All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and deal stores are considered new stores and were excluded from our same-store sales calculation in Q3. Gross profit for the combined organization increased 8.6% to $1.52 billion for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 30.4% versus 28.3% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.8% during the third quarter, and 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's third quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales.
On a GAAP basis, gross profit for the Family Dollar segment increased to 5.6% to $663.2 million. Gross profit margins for Family Dollar segment was 26.2% during the third quarter compared with 23.5% in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $38.4 million and markdowns of $13 million in the prior year -- prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.2% for the quarter compared with an adjusted 25.4% in the prior year's quarter. The improvement is due to lower merchandise, freight and shrink costs, partially offset by higher markdown expense and increased occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization decreased to 23.6% from 23.8% in the same quarter last year as a percent of net sales. Excluding $11.8 million or 25 basis points of acquisition-related expenses in 2015, the SG&A rate remained consistent at 23.6%.  Increases in store hourly payrolls as a percent of net sales were offset by lower professional fees and lower depreciation expense, as a percent of sales. Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.2%, a 90 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $11.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related costs, SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points to 23.2% of sales from 23.6% of sales. The improvement was driven by lower cost as a percent of sales for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs, partially offset by higher store payroll expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment was $606.8 million. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 24% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.8 million for severance benefits, while the prior year's comparable period included $6.8 million of acquisition-related and divestiture cost. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales to 23.8% from 23.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher store payroll, health insurance and advertising costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense.
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $342.4 million compared with $223.7 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 6.8% for the quarter from 4.5% in the last year's third quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 170 basis points to 11.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $11.8 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 11.6% compared to an adjusted 10.4% of sales in the prior year third quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $57.5 million, to 2.2% as a percent of net sales. Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $112.2 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense as well as $26.6 million of acceleration of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million of fees associated with our debt refinancing. Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.5% compared to 34.3% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016 of $21.4 million or $0.09 per share related to a 1% decrease in North Carolina's state tax rate, which decreased the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset, as well as the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, under which the incremental tax benefit recognized the Dollar's restricted stock vested as reported in the income tax expense.
For the third quarter, the company had GAAP net income of $171.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $733.8 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the end of the third quarter of 2015. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 8.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 8.2%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 0.4%.
We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end decreased 2.1% from the same period last year and increased 0.7% on a selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing at in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $95.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $169.5 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $620 million to $650 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels including fee development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the edition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects, and our distribution center projects.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $157.6 million for the third quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization. Depreciation expense was $168.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This includes $17.9 million for Q4 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting evaluation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions:. Beginning in Q4, our acquired Family Dollar stores will be included in our reported same-store sales. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales day shifted into our fourth quarter. This shift is included in our sales guidance. Our 2 additional sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower freight -- import freight costs than a year ago. And our interest expense will be approximately $79 million in Q4.
Our Q4 and full year guidance includes an impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect December 1. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.3% for the fourth quarter and 33% for fiscal 2016.
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.1 million shares in Q4 and 236.7 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.59 billion to $5.69 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.24 to $1.33, an increase from prior implied guidance of $1.21 to $1.30. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increases in both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.9%.
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales in a range between $20.67 billion and $20.77 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.69 billion and $20.87 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.77 -- $3.76, which includes the effect of $0.09 refinancing costs in the third quarter. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.67 to $3.82, which did not include any refinancing costs. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase of 3.9% square footage growth.

Again, I'm very pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. We are making meaningful progress in developing, what I consider to be, the best model in small-box value retail. Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of a 6,000 store banner and an 8,000 store banner, each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers across all types of markets. With the combination of these 2 great brands, we have powerful flexibility in how and where we choose to grow, while expanding our opportunity to grow. Across the combined banners, we will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders.
Retail is an ever-changing environment, over time we've demonstrated our management team's ability to be agile and nimble to effectively adapt to the changing environment. As discussed on prior calls, we have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new FLSA regulations. We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1. As always, we will continue to employ a disciplined approach to drive in key strategic initiatives to the combined organization, through improve communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.
We are confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to the customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.
For 35 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value, no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. In the third quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.6%, same-store sales increased 1.7% and operating margin improved to 11.6%.
Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.

The opportunity is just as big as we saw at the beginning. And as Bob said, we remain just as enthusiastic. A little bit of, when you take a look at the opportunity showed itself in the quarter and even though we were slightly negative for the quarter, August was positive. And then we went against the Red Tag Clearance Event both in September and October. So I wasn't able to overcome some of the traffic. I think the silver lining for me was that the basket lift that we got last year stuck with us this year. And then I would tell you November is starting off how I would hope, going into the holiday season. So I start with saying the foundation that we are building around value, the marketing program, the table stakes, those are the things that we knew we had to do going in just to build the foundation. Anything else we're going to do past that, it has to stick, because we're consistent on delivering value in the store, and we have a shopping experience that our customers find value when they come through the door of a Family Dollar. Long term, what's going to change? While we continue to have the opportunities in front of us that we can enhance by our brands, of course, and we can do more direct imports, but we still have a store base that has wonderful opportunity for us to take a look and figure out how we continue to renovate, put in new assortments, expand the elements in our stores that our customers are looking for. When we see our first-of-the-month business on SNAP for instance, some modest changes that drive business to our frozen food, resonate very well with our customers. So the work so far has been around the foundation that allows us to long-term deploy capital in a meaningful way into our existing store base along with new stores that will create different flow for our customers as she comes in and sees more seasonal merchandise, sees more elements that drive a higher sales per square foot productivity because of our assortment expansions. So that's the work ahead of us. I would tell you that up to this point, we've been very focused on just driving the foundational pieces of our business that we had to fix. And while we are not all the way there, I would tell you we've made progress and it's still our focus as we go into '17."

But I still think the $300 million hold true. What I don't know exactly at this moment is will it maybe be 60% CapEx at the end of the day as opposed to 50%. I think there is -- could be a little bit of movement in that direction as we think about, not only rebanners, but the systems integration and various other projects. We have got one D.C. that we co-bannered, so a lot of things that we have done have required capital dollars to make those changes.

The -- so as we look at it, we look at the Dollar Tree banner, obviously, very strong gross profit during the quarter with improvement of 80 basis points. And, again, lower freight costs, better mark-on. Obviously, our merchant team has been doing a great job continuing to source unbelievable values at the $1 price point. And obviously, it's been a little bit of a buyer's market to a certain extent on the discretionary side for the foreign purchases, so that's always helpful. But again, what we always do is we manage that. We have to make sure that we're credit, providing a value to the consumer at that dollar price point and that's something that we've been able to go. You know freight in itself has been a benefit. I would tell you a couple of things. One, Q4 is the quarter in which we see basically a flip where diesel will not be a benefit in the fourth quarter. Diesel will actually be a slight headwind in the fourth quarter compared to last year than where the pricing was. We have import benefits through our contract, which goes through the end of the April. But obviously, that landscape is changing as well as we go forward, so we have to keep that in mind. But so -- but I would tell you, I would think for the fourth quarter, we would expect to see our gross profit continue to expand in the Dollar Tree banner. On the SG&A side of the equation, we saw some various moving pieces as I spoke to in the sense of lower costs for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs and -- but we also had investment store payroll. So we do believe it's important. We will continue to invest in store payroll as we go forward. We believe it's an important aspect of running good stores that our customers expect as we go forward and the conditions and merchandised and full, fun and friendly. So we think that will continue. But I'd say there is opportunity on the SG&A on an overall basis, but I think probably gross profit is a little bit bigger potential. When you look at Family Dollar, Family Dollar on a GAAP basis basically improved from a flat operating margin to a 2.2 operating margin for the quarter. I think you have a lot of different moving pieces. On an adjusted basis, you saw improvement in the gross profit line items. And really, again, we saw improvement in mark-on, improvement in freight, improvement in shrink. And I think those are areas we think we can continue to improve upon. And I would tell you that one of the call ups was higher markdown, but I think that the somewhat -- that is really a condition of last year. If you remember in Q2 last year, we took $60 million reserve from markdowns for the Red Tag Clearance Event which then happened in Q3. So our -- we are able to take that reserve to offset some of those markdowns in Q3. So our Q3 markdowns last year are probably a little below what they would be on a normal run-rate basis. So that's -- that was not unexpected at the end of the day. On an SG&A basis, I think one of the things we have going on is we do have a geography change going on in the Family Dollar P&L between merchandised margin and advertising. So we are getting -- we are taking -- we are not taking co-op dollars. We are getting at net costs upfront from the product. So we are seeing an increase in advertising, which was called out in my comments -- prepared comments and that will continue as we go forward. So -- but otherwise, we've also had store payroll investments as well in Family Dollar. So some puts and takes there as well. But on a go-forward basis, we do expect there, maybe, some investments there but I would expect that depreciation and amortization on the Family Dollar banner will continue to decrease as we've cycled through the comparisons of the harmonization of depreciation policies and the favorable lease rate. So somewhat of a long-winded answer, but that's kind of the puts and takes, Paul, as I see them."

And so our ability to put in front of the customer what she wants on a weekly, monthly and during the holiday basis is by far the biggest difference that you're going to see at a Family Dollar. The tweaks that you see on assortments going up and down the aisles really reflect around what we think our customer is most interested in and that reflects around our basics and things like candy and our consumable business, including frozen food, which drives traffic; and in our discretionary business; we still have a strong apparel business on ladies that is seasonally relevant and driven by cold weather, which looks like we are finally going to get a bit of as we go into the Thanksgiving holiday. And just around the seasonal displays and impact, much like you see sometimes at Dollar Tree, the things our customers need in the last few days going up to a holiday, Family Dollar shopper shops so much later in the season that our ability to get ready for that and to have those displays on the floor or on the shelf are very important for us. All that being said, I would tell you the biggest lever Family Dollar had at the beginning of this process was just getting in stock.

But I would say it's -- we are going into the very meat of the holiday, obviously, this week and kickoff on Thursday, going to the balance of the quarter into Christmas. Then we'll keep our fingers crossed on weather. But that we'd have just the right amount of cold weather to sell all of our apparel that we need and not too much snow that people can't get to stores. That being said, what's the biggest opportunity, I would say, besides the basics I've mentioned on being in-stock and compelling values, is then renovation of some of our store base. Because we are still at risk on the older stores at Family Dollar that require either perhaps some deferred maintenance, but maybe even more than that gain the right assortment in the store with the right amount of square footage for each of the departments. And that's where we see the path long term to drive a sustained comp at Family Dollar to -- that's the basics in retail about having the right assortment and part of that is how is it set up in each of our stores.

I don't know I can say how I thought about from the beginning to now. I think what -- we've gotten the benefit of is the work on synergy has given us the ability to see that -- when you take a look at the margin expansion at Family Dollar, a good piece of that is a synergy work. Another good chunk of that is what we just do at Family Dollar in terms of auctioning and getting the best cost and as markets go up and down, making sure we are getting true net cost. I think the synergy work over the long term will give us flexibility. So when we said $300 million, I think we've all said we would be disappointed if that's all we ended up with. So the flexibility that, that gives us in Family Dollar is to say where should we invest it now. We went into knowing that we had deferred maintenance in CapEx to put into the stores. We are on a -- we've been following that model. It's a sequenced in a way that gives us the biggest feedback. We've invested in store labor because we just flatly needed to, to give our customer a better shopping experience, but that was -- that's proceeding as we projected. So I don't know that it's changed from what we thought. It, certainly, never quite goes maybe as fast as I would like to see it happen, but I'd -- I feel that we are on track with the things, with the big levers that we started with at Family Dollar. We have stayed focused on and stayed true to. And at the end of the day, staying focused on what our customers will give us credit for.

And so, I -- while the 2 are related, I really think a little bit of it is, how do I get the right assortment at Family Dollar across these categories. You'll see some additional expansions in the future on some categories.

The in-stock piece, while related, is the opportunity for us just to make sure that we are in-stock, on shelf for our customer.

From a Dollar Tree perspective as well as the Family Dollar perspective, we've always seen it as being highly competitive in our sector discount store sector. So it continues to be. We see a lot of activity out there, especially now with the big-box and the grocery stores, and especially, on the food side of the business. From the Dollar Tree side, we're pretty well insulated from that from the standpoint of, our goal is to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and the ever-changing mix. So we don't always excel exactly the same items as some of the big-box retailers or even the Family Dollar small-box sector. So from the Family -- from the Dollar Tree side, we are -- we watch what the competitors are doing as always, but we're really focused on the customer and offering the best value there. That's about half of our business. The other half of our business is Family Dollar and more traditional type of a business, more is planogrammed, we sell lot more of the same things that others sell. We've been watching that. As Gary said, we shop religiously for competition, whoever they may be across a broad geography and very thoroughly, and we take that information and react to it accordingly. Really keeping the focus on what's important to our customers. We want to do what's in the best interest of our customers with the offering. And offer more value in more ways. One of the things that Family Dollar, and I'm extremely excited about, that was touched on really maybe on the last question, was the things that we've done and how -- what may be -- has been accomplished. And one of the major accomplishments I see is our smart ways to save marketing program. It's -- you want -- the store is the ad, the store is what we are selling to our customer. There's more to it than just an item or a product. It's a shopping experience and it's an in-stock, in-store and it's the whole idea of your Family Dollar store and customer engagement in the stores. So we've made a lot of progress on our smart ways to save. Every day low price, as Gary says, throughout the store. Sale items, frequent sale items. Our Dollar WOW! in our stores, it's not a Dollar Tree. But we have a Dollar WOW! section in our Family Dollar stores. It has gained a lot of traction. Our price drop program continues to find traction and interest from the customers. Our shop and compare with our private label and the newest one is our digital coupon, that Gary said, in a short period of time we had over a million customers sign up for. So just that idea of engaging with our customers, the store matches the ad, the ad matches the store. When a customer comes in, there is an expectation of being in-stock, in business, finding what they need. May not be as many SKUs as the big-box guys. We don't have room for everything. But what we have is what our customers expect to have, and we have it in-stock every day as well as our ad items. So I look at the competition always, and I'm very much as we are all a student of retailing. But at the end of the day, all of our actions are focused on the customer and executing our plan to that customer. We are going to be competitive. We're going to be appropriately competitive. We're going to shop the market, but we're looking for more ways to engage the customer to offer even more value than our competitors offer. That takes a little time. But frankly, I think, we are right on target with that. And the building of the foundation that we will expand into the future -- for years into the future, I think that's one of the most important things that we can do as a retailer, just build this Family Dollar business, so that it survives any -- there is always going to be a price issue here, there. There is always going to be emphasis on one category or the other. What will stand the test time is how we are serving our customers, offering the best product at the best price and the shopping experience that they expect."

But our people did such a fabulous job of getting through there. We had stores closed. We had stores without electricity. We lost service from our Savannah Distribution Center for days because we couldn't get workers to the D.C. in order to serve. We were servicing stores in that area out of our South Carolina Distribution Center for example and -- for Dollar Tree. So our store teams and our logistic teams and everyone just did a fabulous job in really difficult times. That was a category for right -- came all the way from Florida up to Virginia off the coast. It hit a lot of people and created a lot of issues. So out of that, we had some extra markdowns because we lost some electricity. We lost a few stores out of that. You see the results though and it's really -- it did not bring us to our knees. It did not cripple us. Our people just did a fabulous job on really scrambling to continue to serve the customer in the best way possible. So we didn't speak to it, because we came through it in rare fashion."

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we've owned the Family Dollar business for a full 3 months in the prior year's comparable",1467,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we've owned the Family Dollar business for a full 3 months in the prior year's comparable quarter. Our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015.
Total sales for the third quarter increased 1.1% to $5 billion. As a reminder, third quarter results last year included sales from 325 Family Dollar stores that were divested after the end of the quarter. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.8%. Operating income increased 53.1% to $342.4 million. Net income for the quarter increased 109.4% (sic) [ 109.5% ] to $171.6 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.72. Adjusting for $0.09 of expense incurred outside of guidance, that was associated with debt refinancing, adjusted EPS was $0.81 and near the top end of our guidance of $0.76 to $0.82 per diluted share.
I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the third quarter. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments improved gross margin rate year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 230 basis points to 6.85% for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share were at the top end of our range of guidance.
The Dollar Tree banner continues to show strong consistent growth, and we continue to make meaningful progress in the integration of Family Dollar. We remain on track to achieve our expected synergies target of $300 million and run rate by the end of the first 3 years. This includes improvements in direct and indirect procurement, rebannering of select stores and the development of our shared services model including supply chain and logistics. There is still much more to be done, and I believe, we will, ultimately, surpass our target. 
Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the third quarter included a total sales increase of 8.6%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% and this was achieved through increases in both traffic and average ticket.  Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points over last year. And operating margin was 11.6%, an improvement of 170 basis points over last year's 9.9%. Excluding acquisition-related costs in the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points. To share some of the color on the quarter, top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner include snacks and beverages, household products, seasonal toys and party supplies. Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. While we continue to experience an estimated 80 basis points of incremental cannibalization resulting from the rebannering of 210 deal stores and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, we delivered positive same-store sales each month throughout the quarter. And despite the calendar shift this year, which moved the last 2 days of October and Halloween sales from third quarter and into fourth quarter, we finished the third quarter strong. October was our highest comp month of the quarter. 
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth for the quarter was strongest in the upper Midwest, the Southwest, the Northeast and the West zones. All zones had positive comps with the exception of the Southeast, which was only slightly negative as it experienced a higher degree of incremental cannibalization from our rebanner initiative. The Dollar Tree business continued to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our third quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day and when these customers are in the store, they're buying more.
Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store, every day. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience and seasonal energy was high beginning in August with Back-to-School.
In addition to dominant displays of Back-to-School basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationery, teacher supplies, classroom residuals and lunchbox values, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 30th anniversary with Bonus Buys and WOW! items for our customers. Key categories including cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event.
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from Back-to-School to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over the prior year. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the Thanksgiving, Christmas and the fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers with sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and through increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the third quarter, we opened a total of 101 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated and expanded 15 Dollar Tree stores, and we rebannered 42 additional Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree's for a total of 158 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter.
Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 8% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,320 Dollar Tree stores across North America. I continue to be pleased with our rebannering efforts. Since the acquisition, our store development teams have rebannered 210 deal stores to Dollar Tree and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 495 new Dollar Tree stores. We ended our third quarter this year with a total of 565 more Dollar Tree stores than the same time one year ago. These new and newly rebannered stores are performing very well in terms of sales and improved operating margin. While the right decision for the long term and the near term, we continue to bear incremental cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 basis points. This headwind will dissipate each quarter through the end of 2017, as we cycle the convergence from the prior year.
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive to business initiatives include category expansion. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eye care as well as home and household products.
Creating a fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our stores fronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store that Dollar Tree always finds an unexpected value. And number four, being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekends, and especially, at the beginning of each month, when many customers are shopping for basic needs. We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 154 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,710 stores with plans to continue growing.
With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create shareholder value as a combined organization. I continue to be as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are deploying a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With a focus on managing our business for the present, we are developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priority."

Our focus at Family Dollar is around the customer-facing initiatives that our customers continue to give us credit for. And we are working hard to improve these across our base of 8,000 stores. Our customers are seeing cleaner, better merchandised stores that have more compelling end cap with price they need for everyday basics and holiday needs. While we have more to do here, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the business basics of the Family Dollar banner.
For Q3, the Family Dollar banner had low single-digit negative same-store sales. However, August was slightly positive. September was our weakest comp during the quarter. And remember last year, we had kicked off our Red Tag Clearance Event mid-month. October was also negative as we cycled the completion of our clearance event last year. And of course, the impact of Halloween in first of the month, shifting money end of the quarter.
However, we did see an acceleration of our 2-year stack comp of greater than 100 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And our Q3 basket improved slightly against a negative transactions for the quarter, primarily from the clearance event last year. Our consumable business at Family Dollar outperformed our discretionary business. And geographically, our West and Mid-Atlantic regions were the strongest performing areas of the country for us.
In real estate, we opened 52 new Family Dollar stores, we relocated or expanded 24 Family Dollar stores for a total of 76 projects, we rebannered 42 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and we ended the quarter with nearly 8,000 Family Dollar stores, 7964 to be exact. We will achieve by year-end our target of 200 new Family Dollar stores for the year. And together with Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners, we now have a total of over 14,000 store locations -- 14,284 across the U.S. and Canada.
At Family Dollar, our customer-facing programs continue to drive and show value throughout the store, as we build momentum with our smart ways to save marketing program. Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all of our foundations on delivering value for our Family Dollar customers. These simple ways to save reflect from our ad into our store and these show our customers EDLP; pricing on every day values; our sale items that reflect the most meaningful values on key items; Dollar well, which drives a surprise in opening price point throughout the store, compare and save to shout-out really our excellent values on our private brands; price drop, which is our great savings passed on to our customers above and beyond. And during the quarter, we completed our national rollout of smart coupons. Our customers have responded positively with above projection sign-ups from our Labor Day kickoff. We already have over 1 million customers who have signed up. For our customers, it completes a ""no-hassle shopping"" experience to find national and Family Dollar exclusive offers. Also, we added emphasis to our ""smart ways of save"" strategy with the kickoff on the CW Network of our partnership of a 30-minute game show called SAVE TO WIN. Our host of the show, Pat Neely, highlights the great product expense throughout the Family Dollar across a high-energy fund format that fits competing real Family Dollar shoppers against each other.
So for Family Dollar, it's a great way to reach a demographic overlap that serves us well and really brings additional credibility to our smart ways to save.
Another fundamental part of our strategy for success is our focus on table sticks. At a high level, this includes improved store standards and conditions; neat, clean, full, recovered; merchandising relevance and energy; finding what I need at Family Dollar and at a value I recognize; and customer engagement, what we call Family Dollar-friendly. Our customers count on us all month long, but the first 10 days of the month at Family Dollar are critical in their efforts to be in stock, recovered and end caps with the compelling offers. Our focus here revolves around our efforts to have improved direct-to-store delivery, support and service along with our operational teams improving our truck-to-shelf process. The convenience of our stores combined with our focus on improvements across our customer-facing initiatives is the foundation for our improved customer experience at Family Dollar.
Our investment across our business is measured with the test and learn discipline to measure our success and to involve our next step initiatives just like at Dollar Tree. So while we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to be the best at delivering value to our customers that are unique in many ways and often underserved. Our stores serve a customer that counts on us and responds when we deliver value, customer service and a Family Dollar shopping experience that we are all proud of in the neighborhoods we serve.

Total sales for the third quarter grew 1.1% to $5 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion.

Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted negatively by the loss of sales from 297 stores, which we rebannered as Dollar Tree stores, in addition to the 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% versus 2.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization of 80 basis points from the 507 Family Dollar and deal stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.8%.
All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and deal stores are considered new stores and were excluded from our same-store sales calculation in Q3. Gross profit for the combined organization increased 8.6% to $1.52 billion for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 30.4% versus 28.3% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.8% during the third quarter, and 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's third quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales.
On a GAAP basis, gross profit for the Family Dollar segment increased to 5.6% to $663.2 million. Gross profit margins for Family Dollar segment was 26.2% during the third quarter compared with 23.5% in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $38.4 million and markdowns of $13 million in the prior year -- prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.2% for the quarter compared with an adjusted 25.4% in the prior year's quarter. The improvement is due to lower merchandise, freight and shrink costs, partially offset by higher markdown expense and increased occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization decreased to 23.6% from 23.8% in the same quarter last year as a percent of net sales. Excluding $11.8 million or 25 basis points of acquisition-related expenses in 2015, the SG&A rate remained consistent at 23.6%.  Increases in store hourly payrolls as a percent of net sales were offset by lower professional fees and lower depreciation expense, as a percent of sales. Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.2%, a 90 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The prior year's quarter included $11.8 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year's acquisition-related costs, SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points to 23.2% of sales from 23.6% of sales. The improvement was driven by lower cost as a percent of sales for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs, partially offset by higher store payroll expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment was $606.8 million. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 24% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.8 million for severance benefits, while the prior year's comparable period included $6.8 million of acquisition-related and divestiture cost. Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales to 23.8% from 23.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher store payroll, health insurance and advertising costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense.
Operating income for the combined organization increased to $342.4 million compared with $223.7 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 6.8% for the quarter from 4.5% in the last year's third quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 170 basis points to 11.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $11.8 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year's quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 11.6% compared to an adjusted 10.4% of sales in the prior year third quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $57.5 million, to 2.2% as a percent of net sales. Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $112.2 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense as well as $26.6 million of acceleration of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million of fees associated with our debt refinancing. Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.5% compared to 34.3% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a onetime tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016 of $21.4 million or $0.09 per share related to a 1% decrease in North Carolina's state tax rate, which decreased the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset, as well as the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, under which the incremental tax benefit recognized the Dollar's restricted stock vested as reported in the income tax expense.
For the third quarter, the company had GAAP net income of $171.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $733.8 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the end of the third quarter of 2015. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 8.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 8.2%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 0.4%.
We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end decreased 2.1% from the same period last year and increased 0.7% on a selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing at in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $95.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $169.5 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $620 million to $650 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels including fee development stores, our rebanner initiatives, the edition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects, and our distribution center projects.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $157.6 million for the third quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization. Depreciation expense was $168.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This includes $17.9 million for Q4 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting evaluation of Family Dollar leases.
Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions:. Beginning in Q4, our acquired Family Dollar stores will be included in our reported same-store sales. In 2016, the last 2 days of October, our biggest Halloween sales day shifted into our fourth quarter. This shift is included in our sales guidance. Our 2 additional sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016. We will continue to experience a higher-than-normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower freight -- import freight costs than a year ago. And our interest expense will be approximately $79 million in Q4.
Our Q4 and full year guidance includes an impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations, which takes effect December 1. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.3% for the fourth quarter and 33% for fiscal 2016.
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.1 million shares in Q4 and 236.7 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.59 billion to $5.69 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.24 to $1.33, an increase from prior implied guidance of $1.21 to $1.30. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increases in both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.9%.
For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales in a range between $20.67 billion and $20.77 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.69 billion and $20.87 billion. The company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.77 -- $3.76, which includes the effect of $0.09 refinancing costs in the third quarter. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.67 to $3.82, which did not include any refinancing costs. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase of 3.9% square footage growth.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

Again, I'm very pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter, and I'm extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. We are making meaningful progress in developing, what I consider to be, the best model in small-box value retail. Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of a 6,000 store banner and an 8,000 store banner, each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers across all types of markets. With the combination of these 2 great brands, we have powerful flexibility in how and where we choose to grow, while expanding our opportunity to grow. Across the combined banners, we will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders.
Retail is an ever-changing environment, over time we've demonstrated our management team's ability to be agile and nimble to effectively adapt to the changing environment. As discussed on prior calls, we have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new FLSA regulations. We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1. As always, we will continue to employ a disciplined approach to drive in key strategic initiatives to the combined organization, through improve communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.
We are confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.
The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It's powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to the customers, while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.
For 35 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value, no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. In the third quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.6%, same-store sales increased 1.7% and operating margin improved to 11.6%.
Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.
Operator, we are now ready for the questions."

The opportunity is just as big as we saw at the beginning. And as Bob said, we remain just as enthusiastic. A little bit of, when you take a look at the opportunity showed itself in the quarter and even though we were slightly negative for the quarter, August was positive. And then we went against the Red Tag Clearance Event both in September and October. So I wasn't able to overcome some of the traffic. I think the silver lining for me was that the basket lift that we got last year stuck with us this year. And then I would tell you November is starting off how I would hope, going into the holiday season. So I start with saying the foundation that we are building around value, the marketing program, the table stakes, those are the things that we knew we had to do going in just to build the foundation. Anything else we're going to do past that, it has to stick, because we're consistent on delivering value in the store, and we have a shopping experience that our customers find value when they come through the door of a Family Dollar. Long term, what's going to change? While we continue to have the opportunities in front of us that we can enhance by our brands, of course, and we can do more direct imports, but we still have a store base that has wonderful opportunity for us to take a look and figure out how we continue to renovate, put in new assortments, expand the elements in our stores that our customers are looking for. When we see our first-of-the-month business on SNAP for instance, some modest changes that drive business to our frozen food, resonate very well with our customers. So the work so far has been around the foundation that allows us to long-term deploy capital in a meaningful way into our existing store base along with new stores that will create different flow for our customers as she comes in and sees more seasonal merchandise, sees more elements that drive a higher sales per square foot productivity because of our assortment expansions. So that's the work ahead of us. I would tell you that up to this point, we've been very focused on just driving the foundational pieces of our business that we had to fix. And while we are not all the way there, I would tell you we've made progress and it's still our focus as we go into '17."

Because if you think about the number of the stores we rebannered as part of that, that's been a fairly large cost at the end of the day. But we probably have spent more, like I said CapEx than OpEx. But I still think the $300 million hold true. What I don't know exactly at this moment is will it maybe be 60% CapEx at the end of the day as opposed to 50%. I think there is -- could be a little bit of movement in that direction as we think about, not only rebanners, but the systems integration and various other projects. We have got one D.C. that we co-bannered, so a lot of things that we have done have required capital dollars to make those changes. So I think it may lean a little bit closer, little heavier on the CapEx side than the OpEx at the end of the day."

The -- so as we look at it, we look at the Dollar Tree banner, obviously, very strong gross profit during the quarter with improvement of 80 basis points. And, again, lower freight costs, better mark-on. Obviously, our merchant team has been doing a great job continuing to source unbelievable values at the $1 price point. And obviously, it's been a little bit of a buyer's market to a certain extent on the discretionary side for the foreign purchases, so that's always helpful. But again, what we always do is we manage that. We have to make sure that we're credit, providing a value to the consumer at that dollar price point and that's something that we've been able to go. You know freight in itself has been a benefit. I would tell you a couple of things. One, Q4 is the quarter in which we see basically a flip where diesel will not be a benefit in the fourth quarter. Diesel will actually be a slight headwind in the fourth quarter compared to last year than where the pricing was. We have import benefits through our contract, which goes through the end of the April. But obviously, that landscape is changing as well as we go forward, so we have to keep that in mind. But so -- but I would tell you, I would think for the fourth quarter, we would expect to see our gross profit continue to expand in the Dollar Tree banner. On the SG&A side of the equation, we saw some various moving pieces as I spoke to in the sense of lower costs for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs and -- but we also had investment store payroll. So we do believe it's important. We will continue to invest in store payroll as we go forward. We believe it's an important aspect of running good stores that our customers expect as we go forward and the conditions and merchandised and full, fun and friendly. So we think that will continue. But I'd say there is opportunity on the SG&A on an overall basis, but I think probably gross profit is a little bit bigger potential. When you look at Family Dollar, Family Dollar on a GAAP basis basically improved from a flat operating margin to a 2.2 operating margin for the quarter. I think you have a lot of different moving pieces. On an adjusted basis, you saw improvement in the gross profit line items. And really, again, we saw improvement in mark-on, improvement in freight, improvement in shrink. And I think those are areas we think we can continue to improve upon. And I would tell you that one of the call ups was higher markdown, but I think that the somewhat -- that is really a condition of last year. If you remember in Q2 last year, we took $60 million reserve from markdowns for the Red Tag Clearance Event which then happened in Q3. So our -- we are able to take that reserve to offset some of those markdowns in Q3. So our Q3 markdowns last year are probably a little below what they would be on a normal run-rate basis. So that's -- that was not unexpected at the end of the day. On an SG&A basis, I think one of the things we have going on is we do have a geography change going on in the Family Dollar P&L between merchandised margin and advertising. So we are getting -- we are taking -- we are not taking co-op dollars. We are getting at net costs upfront from the product. So we are seeing an increase in advertising, which was called out in my comments -- prepared comments and that will continue as we go forward. So -- but otherwise, we've also had store payroll investments as well in Family Dollar. So some puts and takes there as well. But on a go-forward basis, we do expect there, maybe, some investments there but I would expect that depreciation and amortization on the Family Dollar banner will continue to decrease as we've cycled through the comparisons of the harmonization of depreciation policies and the favorable lease rate. So somewhat of a long-winded answer, but that's kind of the puts and takes, Paul, as I see them."

And we have cleaned up, obviously, from a year ago. Really, the merchandise that did not have a home and they tended to collect on end caps. And so our ability to put in front of the customer what she wants on a weekly, monthly and during the holiday basis is by far the biggest difference that you're going to see at a Family Dollar. The tweaks that you see on assortments going up and down the aisles really reflect around what we think our customer is most interested in and that reflects around our basics and things like candy and our consumable business, including frozen food, which drives traffic; and in our discretionary business; we still have a strong apparel business on ladies that is seasonally relevant and driven by cold weather, which looks like we are finally going to get a bit of as we go into the Thanksgiving holiday. And just around the seasonal displays and impact, much like you see sometimes at Dollar Tree, the things our customers need in the last few days going up to a holiday, Family Dollar shopper shops so much later in the season that our ability to get ready for that and to have those displays on the floor or on the shelf are very important for us. All that being said, I would tell you the biggest lever Family Dollar had at the beginning of this process was just getting in stock. And that's what we continue to work on every day of the week to make sure that we have it with support from our DST suppliers as well as what we're touching from the back door to our shelf."

Really a lot of our focus is what's happening to us from the 1st through the 10th of the month and that is where we saw a nice impact on first of month. And we've been able to sustain that kind of activity through the additional weeks. Big week in front of us, obviously. But I would say it's -- we are going into the very meat of the holiday, obviously, this week and kickoff on Thursday, going to the balance of the quarter into Christmas. Then we'll keep our fingers crossed on weather. But that we'd have just the right amount of cold weather to sell all of our apparel that we need and not too much snow that people can't get to stores. That being said, what's the biggest opportunity, I would say, besides the basics I've mentioned on being in-stock and compelling values, is then renovation of some of our store base. Because we are still at risk on the older stores at Family Dollar that require either perhaps some deferred maintenance, but maybe even more than that gain the right assortment in the store with the right amount of square footage for each of the departments. And that's where we see the path long term to drive a sustained comp at Family Dollar to -- that's the basics in retail about having the right assortment and part of that is how is it set up in each of our stores. So when you take a look at the Family Dollar fleet, it works against us right now, where we have a large fleet of older stores. The upside is once we get into them and renovate them, there is a long runway there for us to keep improvement across our store base."

I don't know I can say how I thought about from the beginning to now. I think what -- we've gotten the benefit of is the work on synergy has given us the ability to see that -- when you take a look at the margin expansion at Family Dollar, a good piece of that is a synergy work. Another good chunk of that is what we just do at Family Dollar in terms of auctioning and getting the best cost and as markets go up and down, making sure we are getting true net cost. I think the synergy work over the long term will give us flexibility. So when we said $300 million, I think we've all said we would be disappointed if that's all we ended up with. So the flexibility that, that gives us in Family Dollar is to say where should we invest it now. We went into knowing that we had deferred maintenance in CapEx to put into the stores. We are on a -- we've been following that model. It's a sequenced in a way that gives us the biggest feedback. We've invested in store labor because we just flatly needed to, to give our customer a better shopping experience, but that was -- that's proceeding as we projected. So I don't know that it's changed from what we thought. It, certainly, never quite goes maybe as fast as I would like to see it happen, but I'd -- I feel that we are on track with the things, with the big levers that we started with at Family Dollar. We have stayed focused on and stayed true to. And at the end of the day, staying focused on what our customers will give us credit for. And that's maybe the anchor that we went into this with and it's where we are today."

You mentioned the in-stocks being the most important lever. If I think back to the management of the business under the prior regime, one of the things that was tried at various times was to change the SKU counts, increase the assortments in terms of total choice, particularly in HBA that was the category where they took assortment counts up, and then -- and so what I'm wondering, and this is partially based on visiting the stores and sometimes noting that the Family Dollar stores appear to have fewer items or choices than some comparable format retailers, where do you are think you are with the breadth of the assortment in the stores? Does it need to increase, decrease and how does that relate to the efforts to get in-stocks in place as you move forward?"

I think our measured approach here has really been doing line reviews and really taking a look at the SKUs that are most meaningful for our Family Dollar customer, what's responding to us as we put against the backdrop of our smart ways to save. And we are going to take a look really 4 feet by 4 feet that says, what's the reason to have the offering that's in front of the customer and to have the right assortment. I'm not caught up in SKU count. It's certainly a piece of it as much as it is on how I'm going to drive productivity and profitability 4 feet by 4 feet through the store. And so, I -- while the 2 are related, I really think a little bit of it is, how do I get the right assortment at Family Dollar across these categories. You'll see some additional expansions in the future on some categories. But clearly, we had an opportunity to just get ourselves looking through the lens of value from our customer to have the right assortment at Family Dollar. The in-stock piece, while related, is the opportunity for us just to make sure that we are in-stock, on shelf for our customer. And that's the work we are working very hard on to make sure that we have, especially the first 10 days of the month, but have the items that are most meaningful for our customer on the shelf. So the 2 are as hand and glove, but I sort of view them independently in terms of our work process."

We see a l",745,"Alvin, this is Bob. Just a couple of notes on the competition. From a Dollar Tree perspective as well as the Family Dollar perspective, we've always seen it as being highly competitive in our sector discount store sector. So it continues to be. We see a lot of activity out there, especially now with the big-box and the grocery stores, and especially, on the food side of the business. From the Dollar Tree side, we're pretty well insulated from that from the standpoint of, our goal is to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and the ever-changing mix. So we don't always excel exactly the same items as some of the big-box retailers or even the Family Dollar small-box sector. So from the Family -- from the Dollar Tree side, we are -- we watch what the competitors are doing as always, but we're really focused on the customer and offering the best value there. That's about half of our business. The other half of our business is Family Dollar and more traditional type of a business, more is planogrammed, we sell lot more of the same things that others sell. We've been watching that. As Gary said, we shop religiously for competition, whoever they may be across a broad geography and very thoroughly, and we take that information and react to it accordingly. Really keeping the focus on what's important to our customers. We want to do what's in the best interest of our customers with the offering. And offer more value in more ways. One of the things that Family Dollar, and I'm extremely excited about, that was touched on really maybe on the last question, was the things that we've done and how -- what may be -- has been accomplished. And one of the major accomplishments I see is our smart ways to save marketing program. It's -- you want -- the store is the ad, the store is what we are selling to our customer. There's more to it than just an item or a product. It's a shopping experience and it's an in-stock, in-store and it's the whole idea of your Family Dollar store and customer engagement in the stores. So we've made a lot of progress on our smart ways to save. Every day low price, as Gary says, throughout the store. Sale items, frequent sale items. Our Dollar WOW! in our stores, it's not a Dollar Tree. But we have a Dollar WOW! section in our Family Dollar stores. It has gained a lot of traction. Our price drop program continues to find traction and interest from the customers. Our shop and compare with our private label and the newest one is our digital coupon, that Gary said, in a short period of time we had over a million customers sign up for. So just that idea of engaging with our customers, the store matches the ad, the ad matches the store. When a customer comes in, there is an expectation of being in-stock, in business, finding what they need. May not be as many SKUs as the big-box guys. We don't have room for everything. But what we have is what our customers expect to have, and we have it in-stock every day as well as our ad items. So I look at the competition always, and I'm very much as we are all a student of retailing. But at the end of the day, all of our actions are focused on the customer and executing our plan to that customer. We are going to be competitive. We're going to be appropriately competitive. We're going to shop the market, but we're looking for more ways to engage the customer to offer even more value than our competitors offer. That takes a little time. But frankly, I think, we are right on target with that. And the building of the foundation that we will expand into the future -- for years into the future, I think that's one of the most important things that we can do as a retailer, just build this Family Dollar business, so that it survives any -- there is always going to be a price issue here, there. There is always going to be emphasis on one category or the other. What will stand the test time is how we are serving our customers, offering the best product at the best price and the shopping experience that they expect."
