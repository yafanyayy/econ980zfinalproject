Overall, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.

Overall, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We delivered solid earnings despite global economic and geopolitical challenges, which demonstrates the resiliency of our consumers and business model. Full year earnings per share increased 5% in 2015 adjusting for our second quarter payment settlement charge and all 3 of our business segments produced relatively good constant currency revenue growth during the year. Consumer-to-Consumer revenues increased 3% in constant currency with slight growth in retail initiated money transfer, boosted by very strong results from digital as Western Union constant currency revenues increased 26% for the year. Western Union business solutions constant currency revenue increased 7% and the segment's EBITDA margins improved from 11% to 15%. And consumer bill payments also contributed a strong year with constant currency revenue growing 11%. 
From a macro perspective, while the U.S. market was solid, many other parts of the world experienced slowing economic growth, depreciating currencies are geopolitical instability in 2015, and low oil prices effected several cent markets. As a result of many of these factors, we saw significant outbound declines in markets such as Russia, Angola, Greece, and Libya. Despite this, transactions and constant currency revenues in our retail money transfer business increased slightly showing the ongoing importance of cash to consumers around the world, while we continue to drive strong growth from our digital business. Operating margins increased from 20.3% to 20.9%, excluding the charge, and cash flow was strong again with approximately $1.1 billion generated from operating activities and over $800 million return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Today, we also announced a 3% increase in our first quarter dividend, which equates to $0.64 per share annually, and we remain committed to consistently returning funds to shareholders. In addition to the financial results, we made important progress in key strategic areas in 2015. Our strategies are designed to leverage our platform and other capabilities to allow us to access more used cases and customer segments for cross-border money movements. In 2015, we continued our digital expansion adding 10 new westernunion.com online transaction sites which raised our total to 34 countries. We introduced WU Connect, which allows us to offer cross-border money transfer services on third-party platforms, such as social media and messaging companies among others. We signed our first WU Connect partnership in 2015 with We Chat, a leading Chinese social communication platform and we just announced our second with Viber, a leading mobile messaging app, which will make our money transfer service available to their consumers here in the U.S. 
We are in the process of putting promotional programs in place with both partners, and we believe these operatings will generate incremental revenues over the long-term. We also made additional investments in our technology in 2015 to position us for the future and rolled out further compliance and anti-money laundering enhancements. And we expanded our account payout network, which will allow us to target account receivers in the future. This is an important new potential revenue source for Western Union as funds into accounts make up the largest portion of the cross-border principal pool, and we now have the capability to send over $1 billion accounts into 50-plus countries. 
We will talk more about our strategic initiatives at our Investor's Day in March, but let me turn now to our 2016 outlook. We expect global economic growth to be challenging and currencies to be volatile again in 2016, and we believe we will continue to deal with external challenges and disruptions in various countries. The stronger dollar is also going to affect our repository results. We remain confident, however, that our multichannel business model will deliver solid transaction and constant currency revenue growth this year with strong cash flow and continued returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We anticipate good constant currency growth from westernunion.com and business solutions again in 2016 and steady performance from a retail money transfer. 
Over the long-term, we believe the unique combination of our strong global brand, our network and our cross-border expertise and capabilities give us great opportunities to expand our reach in cross-border money movements, including adding new used cases with our WU Connect and account payout platforms. 
I will now like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and 2016 outlook in more detail."
909408,322512334,929736,"The Western Union Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. As I reviewed 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter revenues are $1.4 billi",2014,"Thank you, Hikmet. As I reviewed 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter revenues are $1.4 billion, increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $74 million compared to the prior-year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues increased 2% constant currency and reported revenues declined 3%, while transactions grew 3% in the quarter. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and solid growth from U.S. outbound. In the quarter, total C2C cross-border principle declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency. Principle per transaction was down 6% compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as the fee increased 1% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 6 percentage points, including a negative 5% impact in currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1%, while mix had minimal impact in the quarter overall and pricing environment remains stable as our net C2C pricing change for the full year was essentially flat. 
Turning to the regions. Due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contribution to the regional results. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 8% that was flat on a constant currency basis. Transactions increased 1%. In the region, strong revenue growth in Germany was largely offset by continued weakness in Russia. The Greece business improved compared to the third quarter as the market imposed restrictions were largely lifted although revenue was still below prior year levels. North America revenue was flat or increased 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. U.S. outbound continue to deliver strong growth in the quarter driven primarily by cents to Mexico and Latin America. Our Mexico business again grew faster than the market based on the latest Mexico data for both the fourth quarter and full year. The domestic money transfer business produced improved trends in the quarter as transactions increased 8% while revenue growth turned positive with a 2% increase. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 5% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 1%. Similar to the third quarter, declines in Angola and other African countries offset growth in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Asia Pacific, revenue was down 6% or up 1% constant currency, while transaction in the region decreased 5% and continued weakness in the Philippines was partially offset by good growth in Japan and China. Revenue and Latin America and Caribbean region was down 2% or increased 5% constant currency while transactions increased 7% in the quarter. The regions constant currency growth was primarily driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 21% in the quarter or 25% constant currency. westernunion.com transactions increased 28% with U.S. originated online transactions grew 35%. Electronic channels revenue, which includes wu.com, account-based money transfer through bank and mobile money transfer, represented 7% of total company revenue in the quarter. I do want to mention that we will be making a slight change to our regional reporting for C2C in the first quarter. Rather than separating the westernunion.com business from the regions, we will begin reporting it within the regional numbers spending, the revenue 50-50 between the send and received regions. With online transactions like now in 34 countries, we believe this will give a better perspective on total regional performance, while we will still continue to provide the westernunion.com standalone metrics as additional information. 
Turning back to the fourth quarter, in the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 4% or 9% on a constant currency basis driven by growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions recorded revenues increased 1% or 8% on a constant currency basis. This revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products. The consolidated operating profit margin was 20.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 19.6% in the prior-year period. The operating margin benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and from foreign exchange hedge gains. These benefits were partially offset by higher technology expense in the quarter. We recorded approximately $21 million of hedge gains on our revenue and profit lines in the current period up from $9 million of gains in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our cost savings initiatives. We had approximately $11 million of expenses in the quarter on actions to drive future cost efficiencies, which compares to approximately $30 million of such expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, prior cost savings initiatives contributed approximately $6 million of incremental savings in the fourth quarter and full year total savings were approximately $32 million. Technology spending and investment increased compared to the prior year as we invested enhancements to our platforms digital capabilities, settlement systems and data center transformation, all of which will continue in 2016. Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.6% in the prior-year period, while the full year compliance expense was 3.6% of revenue. EBITDA margin of 25.4% in the quarter increased from 24.5% in the prior-year period. Our tax rate was 10.4%, an increase from 6.1% in last year's fourth quarter, which benefited from various nonrecurring items. 
For the full year, our reported tax rate was 11%. Excluding the impact of the Pay settlement charges in the second quarter, the full year effective tax rate was 11.8%. Earnings per share in the quarter was flat with last year at $0.42. An increase operating profit and fewer diluted shares outstanding were offset by the increased tax rate. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 24% compared to 23.1% in the prior-year period. The C2C operating margin also benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and the foreign exchange hedge gains, which were partially offset by higher technology expense. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.9 in the quarter compared to 14.2% in the prior-year period. The margin decrease is due to the higher local currency expenses in Argentina, including various inflation adjustments and increased technology expense, which were partially offset by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives. 
Business Solutions reported operating profit of $4 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in the same period last year. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in both the current and prior quarters. The EBITDA margins for Business Solutions improved to 16.2% compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion for the year. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth quarter and $267 million for the year, which equates to just under 5% of revenues. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.3 billion. The company utilized U.S. cash to pay out the $250 million debt maturity during the fourth quarter. As a result, about 30% of the cash was held by United States entities as of quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $69 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $712 million at year-end. The outstanding share count at the end of the year was 502 million shares. We also paid $78 million in dividends in the quarter and we're pleased to announce today a further 3% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Turning to the 2016 in outlook. As Hikmet mentioned, we expect continued steady constant currency results from retail money transfer and good performance from our growth such as westernunion.com. We expect the C2C pricing environment to remain stable with strategic pricing adjustments similar to last year. Our money transfer consumers have been resilient, which has given us a reliable business model and solid earnings and cash flow generation even in some difficult economic time periods. Our outlook does reflect a challenging macroeconomic environment in many parts of the world and negative impact from the stronger dollar relative to 2015 average rate. 
Specifically, we anticipate foreign currency changes and reduced hedge benefits will negatively impact revenues by approximately $250 million and operating profit by approximately $100 million compared to 2015 rates including the impact of hedges. The outlook is primarily based on recent exchange rates with the euro assumed at $1.08. The estimated $100 million profit impact results from just over $25 million of reduced hedge benefits compared to 2015, approximately $25 million related to Argentina and the remainder from translation of profits in various currencies around the world. We expect the benefit of approximately $50 million from foreign exchange currency hedge gains in 2016, but this is down from the $78 million of benefit achieved in 2015. So the year-on-year impact on profit and margins from hedges is negative. 
In Argentina, the peso devalued in late December as new economic policies were implemented, and its value not more than 30% lower than the average rates for 2015. We have both money transfer and bill payments businesses in Argentina, which represent about 4% of company revenues last year. So the devaluation translates to approximately $100 million of revenue impact and approximately $25 million of operating profit impact. We expect compliance expense in a range of 3.5% to 4%, which is similar to last year. The margin outlook also reflects over $50 million of incremental technology expense as we make further investments in our capability. Otherwise, given the challenges from currency, we are managing expenses very tightly. Excluding all impacts from foreign exchange rate movements, the outlook for operating margins in 2016 would be similar to 2015. Achieving our outlook operating margin in 2016 would mark the fourth consecutive year of margins around 20% with currency contributing to the step up to 21% in 2015 and driving the anticipated step back to approximately 20% this year. 
We have worked hard to stabilize margins over the last few years and what has been a relatively low growth reported revenue environment compared with rising compliance cost, and we are pleased with our progress. We expect the tax rate to increase from 11.8% in 2015, excluding the pay charge to mid-teen level in 2016. And we expect the rate to be somewhat higher in the first half of the year than the second. Putting this all together, our initial 2016 outlook calls fo low to mid-single-digit constant currency growth with GAAP revenue of approximately 400 basis points lower than the constant currency growth, operating margin as approximately 20%. earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70, which includes an approximately $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange and also reflects the impact of higher tax rate; and cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1 billion; similar to last year, the cash flow outlook excludes approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to our agreement, some are all of which may are currently 2016. We anticipate completing the remaining $712 million of our buyback authorization over the course of 2016 and 2017, and we also plan to issue additional debt to our lease partially repaid $1 billion note matured in 2016. 
So summarize, we were pleased with our -- to deliver our results in 2015 despite a tough environment. We expect to drive stable performance and continued strong cash flow generation allocation in 2016, while we execute our strategies to drive long-term growth. So with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions."

However, there is a huge geopolitical oil prices may be also have an impact in the Middle East urban business in long-term. And generally, year-to-date and last year, we saw a quite solid business and our customers are growing. Our growth is also coming from new incremental revenue, new customer segment adding on that with our online business, with our mobile business growing really strong. And these are new customers and it's not cannibalizing our strong retail money transfer business which is resilient."

As Raj mentioned earlier, first of all, on the Mexico, Latin America, U.S. to Mexico corridor, obviously, a bunk of the Mexico data shows that we are definitely doing better than the market and that's not the first time and that been very consistent over the last quarters. And I am very proud of the team that they are doing a good job. We will -- we're going continue to do corridor-by-corridor pricing, suite corner pricing, really very intelligent pricing to attract new customers to compete on that, but I don't see big pricing changes. I really see the pricing environment quite stable. On online, when we entered into new market in our online business, we may do some promotions to enter into market to promote our channel there. But overall, I would say that market environment has been stable. Look, no one can send money from 1 corner to 200 -- like you hear from Denver to 200 countries for 500,000 locations, in 100,000 ATMs. Now also 1 billion accounts dropping money really in a fast through a efficient way in 131 currency. So that's what we are doing. It's not over priced, the customers like our product and they are really working on that. So the last question was on the wu.com pricing, as I mentioned on the wu.com pricing, I believe that it will continue to do promotions like we are being very successful on India promotions. And but our aim is always profitable, being profitable and online we are making money. Just I want to make the point that we do make money and we are increasing our margins also in online and getting profitable."

909408,322512334,929868,"The Western Union Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.

Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We delivered solid earnings despite global economic and geopolitical challenges, which demonstrates the resiliency of our consumers and business model. Full year earnings per share increased 5% in 2015 adjusting for our second quarter payment settlement charge and all 3 of our business segments produced relatively good constant currency revenue growth during the year. Consumer-to-Consumer revenues increased 3% in constant currency with slight growth in retail initiated money transfer, boosted by very strong results from digital as Western Union constant currency revenues increased 26% for the year. Western Union Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 7% and the segment's EBITDA margins improved from 11% to 15%. And consumer bill payments also contributed a strong year with constant currency revenue growing 11%. 
From a macro perspective, while the U.S. market was solid, many other parts of the world experienced slowing economic growth, depreciating currencies or geopolitical instability in 2015, and low oil prices effected several send markets. As a result of many of these factors, we saw significant outbound declines in markets such as Russia, Angola, Greece and Libya. Despite this, transactions and constant currency revenue in our retail money transfer business increased slightly, showing the ongoing importance of cash to consumers around the world, while we continue to drive strong growth from our digital business. Operating margins increased from 20.3% to 20.9%, excluding the charge, and cash flow was strong again with approximately $1.1 billion generated from operating activities and over $800 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Today, we also announced a 3% increase in our first quarter dividend, which equates to $0.64 per share annually, and we remain committed to consistently returning funds to shareholders. In addition to the financial results, we made important progress in key strategic areas in 2015. Our strategies are designed to leverage our platform and other capabilities to allow us to access more used cases and customer segments for cross-border money movement. In 2015, we continued our digital expansion, adding 10 new westernunion.com online transaction sites, which raised our total to 34 countries. We introduced WU Connect, which allows us to offer cross-border money transfer services on third-party platforms, such as social media and messaging companies, among others. We signed our first WU Connect partnership in 2015 with We Chat, a leading Chinese social communication platform and we just announced our second with Viber, a leading mobile messaging app, which will make our money transfer service available to their consumers here in the U.S. 
We are in the process of putting promotional programs in place with both partners, and we believe these offerings will generate incremental revenues over the long term. We also made additional investments in our technology in 2015 to position us for the future and rolled out further compliance and anti-money laundering enhancements. And we expanded our account payout network, which will allow us to target account-driven receivers in the future. This is an important new potential revenue source for Western Union, as funds into accounts makeup the largest portion of the cross-border principal pool, and we now have the capability to send to over $1 billion accounts into 50-plus countries.
We will talk more about our strategic initiatives at our Investor's Day in March, but let me turn now to our 2016 outlook. We expect global economic growth to be challenging and currencies to be volatile again in 2016, and we believe we will continue to deal with external challenges and disruptions in various countries. The stronger dollar is also going to affect our reported results. We remain confident, however, that our multichannel business model will deliver solid transaction and constant currency revenue growth this year with strong cash flow and continued returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We anticipate good constant currency growth from westernunion.com and Business Solutions again in 2016 and steady performance from a retail money transfer. 
Over the long term, we believe the unique combination of our strong global brand, our vast network and our cross-border expertise and capabilities give us great opportunities to expand our reach in cross-border money movement, including adding new used cases with our WU Connect and account payout platforms. 
I will now like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and 2016 outlook in more detail."
909408,322512334,929868,"The Western Union Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. As I reviewed 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter revenues are $1.4 billi",2026,"Thank you, Hikmet. As I reviewed 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter revenues are $1.4 billion, increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. Our reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $74 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues increased 2% constant currency and reported revenues declined 3%, while transactions grew 3% in the quarter. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and solid growth from U.S. outbound. In the quarter, total C2C cross-border principal declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 6% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as it increased 1% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 6 percentage points, including a negative 5% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1%, while mix had minimal impact in the quarter overall. The pricing environment remains stable. And our net C2C pricing change for the full year was essentially flat. 
Turning to the regions. Due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 8%, but was flat on a constant currency basis. Transactions increased 1%. In the region, strong revenue growth in Germany was largely offset by continued weakness in Russia. The Greece business improved compared to the third quarter as the market-imposed restrictions were largely lifted, although revenue was still below prior year levels. North America revenue was flat or increased 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. U.S. outbound continue to deliver strong growth in the quarter, driven primarily by sends to Mexico and Latin America. Our Mexico business again grew faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for both the fourth quarter and full year. The domestic money transfer business produced improved trends in the quarter as transactions increased 8% while revenue growth turned positive with a 2% increase. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 5% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 1%. Similar to the third quarter, declines in Angola and other African countries offset growth in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Asia Pacific, revenue was down 6% or up 1% constant currency, while transactions in the region decreased 5% and continued weakness in the Philippines was partially offset by good growth in Japan and China. Revenue in Latin America and Caribbean region was down 2% or increased 5% constant currency, while transactions increased 7% in the quarter. The region's constant currency growth was primarily driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 21% in the quarter or 25% constant currency. Westernunion.com transactions increased 28% with U.S. originated online transactions grew 35%. Electronic channels revenue, which includes wu.com, account-based money transfer through bank and mobile money transfer, represented 7% of total company revenue in the quarter. I do want to mention that we will be making a slight change to our regional reporting for C2C in the first quarter. Rather than separating the westernunion.com business from the regions, we will begin reporting it within the regional numbers splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions. With online transactions right now in 34 countries, we believe this will give a better perspective on total regional performance, while we will still continue to provide the westernunion.com standalone metrics as additional information. 
Turning back to the fourth quarter, in the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 4% or 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 8% on a constant currency basis. This revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products. The consolidated operating profit margin was 20.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 19.6% in the prior year period. The operating margin benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and from foreign exchange hedge gains. These benefits were partially offset by higher technology expense in the quarter. We recorded approximately $21 million of hedge gains on our revenue and profit lines in the current period, up from $9 million of gains in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our cost savings initiatives. We had approximately $11 million of expenses in the quarter on actions to drive future cost efficiencies, which compares to approximately $30 million of such expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, prior cost savings initiatives contributed approximately $6 million of incremental savings in the fourth quarter and full year total savings were approximately $32 million. Technology spending and investment increased compared to the prior year as we invested enhancements to our platforms, digital capabilities, settlement systems and data center transformation, all of which will continue in 2016. Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.6% in the prior year period, while the full year compliance expense was 3.6% of revenue. EBITDA margin of 25.4% in the quarter increased from 24.5% in the prior year period. Our tax rate was 10.4%, an increase from 6.1% in last year's fourth quarter, which benefited from various nonrecurring items. 
For the full year, our reported tax rate was 11%. Excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement charges in the second quarter, the full year effective tax rate was 11.8%. Earnings per share in the quarter was flat with last year at $0.42 and increased operating profit and fewer diluted shares outstanding were offset by the increased tax rate. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 24% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The C2C operating margin also benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and foreign exchange hedge gains, which were partially offset by higher technology expense. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.9% in the quarter compared to 14.2% in the prior year period. The margin decrease is due to the higher local currency expenses in Argentina, including various inflation adjustments and increased technology expense, which were partially offset by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives.
Business Solutions reported operating profit of $4 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in the same period last year. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in both the current and prior year quarters. EBITDA margins for Business Solutions improved to 16.2% compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion for the year. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth quarter and $267 million for the year, which equates to just under 5% of revenues. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.3 billion. The company utilized U.S. cash to pay out the $250 million debt maturity during the fourth quarter. As a result, approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities as of quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $69 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $712 million at year-end. The outstanding share count at the end of the year was 502 million shares. We also paid $78 million in dividends in the quarter, and we're pleased to announce today the further 3% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Turning to the 2016 outlook. As Hikmet mentioned, we expect continued steady constant currency results from retail money transfer and good performance from our growth such as westernunion.com. We expect the C2C pricing environment to remain stable with strategic pricing adjustments similar to last year. Our money transfer consumers have been resilient, which has given us a reliable business model and solid earnings and cash flow generation even in some difficult economic time periods. Our outlook does reflect a challenging macroeconomic environment in many parts of the world and negative impact from the stronger dollar relative to 2015 average rates. 
Specifically, we anticipate foreign currency changes and reduced hedge benefits will negatively impact revenues by approximately $250 million and operating profit by approximately $100 million compared to 2015 rates including the impact of hedges. The outlook is primarily based on recent exchange rates with the euro assumed at $1.08. The estimated $100 million profit impact results from just over $25 million of reduced hedge benefits compared to 2015, approximately $25 million related to Argentina and the remainder from translation of profits in various currencies around the world. We expect the benefit of approximately $50 million from foreign exchange currency hedge gains in 2016, but this is down from the $78 million of benefit achieved in 2015. So the year-on-year impact on profit and margins from hedges is negative. 
In Argentina, the peso devalued in late December as new economic policies were implemented, and its value is now more than 30% lower than the average rates for 2015. We have both money transfer and bill payments businesses in Argentina, which represent about 4% of company revenues last year. So the devaluation translates to approximately $100 million of revenue impact and approximately $25 million of operating profit impact. We expect compliance expense in a range of 3.5% to 4%, which is similar to last year. The margin outlook also reflects over $50 million of incremental technology expense as we make further investments in our capability. Otherwise, given the challenges from currency, we are managing expenses very tightly. Excluding all impacts from foreign exchange rate movements, the outlook for operating margins in 2016 would be similar to 2015. Achieving our outlook operating margin in 2016 would mark the fourth consecutive year of margins around 20%, with currency contributing to the step up to 21% in 2015 and driving the anticipated step back to approximately 20% this year. 
We have worked hard to stabilize margins over the last few years and what has been a relatively low growth reported revenue environment compared with rising compliance cost, and we are pleased with our progress. We expect the tax rate to increase from 11.8% in 2015, excluding the Paymap charge to mid-teens level in 2016. And we expect the rate to be somewhat higher in the first half of the year than the second. Putting this all together, our initial 2016 outlook calls for low to mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth, with GAAP revenue of approximately 400 basis points lower than the constant currency growth, operating margin of approximately 20%, earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70, which includes an approximately $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange and also reflects the impact of higher tax rate; and cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1 billion. Similar to last year, the cash flow outlook excludes approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to IRS agreement, some or all of which may occur in late 2016. We anticipate completing the remaining $712 million of our buyback authorization over the course of 2016 and 2017. And we also plan to issue additional debt to at least partially repay the $1 billion note matured in 2016. 
So to summarize, we were pleased with our -- to deliver our results in 2015 despite a tough environment. We expect to drive stable performance and continued strong cash flow generation and allocation in 2016, while we execute our strategies to drive long-term growth. So with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions."

But once again, I just want to make the point, none of our countries from revenue side is bigger -- outside the U.S., bigger than 7%. So we have a really quite balanced environment. I mean, as Raj mentioned earlier, Germany, for instance, produced pretty good outbound numbers again which is obviously engine of Europe and continue to produce that. So I feel comfortable that being that global, having that portfolio, we could respond better than the other companies to the economic challenges."

This year, we have around $50 million based on our current rate assumptions, and that's a negative to the margins. And then the remaining piece of it is just overall translations.

And you'll hear coming up, new announcements on that, using our capabilities. And I believe it's really attracting new customer segments. For instance, people who want to send in a different way, don't want to carry cash in a location. And we saw the similar pattern also in Europe. These are additional customers, not one that use retail, but still they want to use Western Union and add additional growth. And that's going to happen, I believe, also in Asia."

Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We delivered solid earnings despite global economic and geopolitical challenges, which demonstrates the resiliency of our consumers and business model. Full year earnings per share increased 5% in 2015 adjusting for our second quarter payment settlement charge and all 3 of our business segments produced relatively good constant currency revenue growth during the year. Consumer-to-Consumer revenues increased 3% in constant currency with slight growth in retail initiated money transfer, boosted by very strong results from digital as Western Union constant currency revenues increased 26% for the year. Western Union Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 7% and the segment's EBITDA margins improved from 11% to 15%. And consumer bill payments also contributed a strong year with constant currency revenue growing 11%. 
From a macro perspective, while the U.S. market was solid, many other parts of the world experienced slowing economic growth, depreciating currencies or geopolitical instability in 2015, and low oil prices affected several [indiscernible] markets. As a result of many of these factors, we saw significant outbound declines in markets such as Russia, Angola, Greece and Libya. Despite this, transactions and constant currency revenue in our retail money transfer business increased slightly, showing the ongoing importance of cash to consumers around the world, while we continued to drive strong growth from our digital business. Operating margins increased from 20.3% to 20.9%, excluding the charge, and cash flow was strong again with approximately $1.1 billion generated from operating activities and over $800 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Today, we also announced a 3% increase in our first quarter dividend, which equates to $0.64 per share annually, and we remain committed to consistently returning funds to shareholders. In addition to the financial results, we made important progress in key strategic areas in 2015. Our strategies are designed to leverage our platform and other capabilities to allow us to access more used cases and customer segments for cross-border money movements. 
In 2015 we continued our digital expansion, adding 10 new westernunion.com online transaction sites, which raised our total to 34 countries. We introduced WU Connect, which allows us to offer cross-border money transfer services on third-party platforms, such as social media and messaging companies, among others. We signed our first WU Connect partnership in 2015 with WeChat, a leading Chinese social communication platform and we just announced our second with Viber, a leading mobile messaging app, which will make our money transfer service available to their consumers here in the U.S. 
We are in the process of putting promotional programs in place with both partners, and we believe these offerings will generate incremental revenues over the long term. We also made additional investments in our technology in 2015 to position us for the future and rolled out further compliance and anti-money laundering enhancements. And we expanded our account payout network, which will allow us to target account-driven receivers in the future. This is an important new potential revenue source for Western Union, as funds into accounts make up the largest portion of the cross-border principal pool, and we now have the capability to send to over $1 billion accounts into 50-plus countries.
We will talk more about our strategic initiatives at our Investor's Day in March, but let me turn now to our 2016 outlook. We expect global economic growth to be challenging and currencies to be volatile again in 2016, and we believe we will continue to deal with external challenges and disruptions in various countries. The stronger dollar is also going to affect our reported results. We remain confident, however, that our multichannel business model will deliver solid transaction and constant currency revenue growth this year with strong cash flow and continued returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We anticipate good constant currency growth from westernunion.com and Business Solutions again in 2016 and steady performance from a retail money transfer. 
Over the long term, we believe the unique combination of our strong global brand, our vast network and our cross-border expertise and capabilities give us great opportunities to expand our reach in cross-border money movement, including adding new used cases with our WU Connect and account payout platforms. 
I will now like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and 2016 outlook in more detail."
909408,322512334,929920,"The Western Union Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. As I reviewed 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.4 billio",2027,"Thank you, Hikmet. As I reviewed 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.4 billion, increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. Our reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $74 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues increased 2% constant currency and reported revenues declined 3%, while transactions grew 3% in the quarter. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and solid growth from U.S. outbound. In the quarter, total C2C cross-border principal declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 6% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as it increased 1% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 6 percentage points, including a negative 5% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1%, while mix had minimal impact in the quarter overall. The pricing environment remains stable. And our net C2C pricing change for the full year was essentially flat. 
Turning to the regions. Due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 8%, but was flat on a constant currency basis. Transactions increased 1%. In the region, strong revenue growth in Germany was largely offset by continued weakness in Russia. The Greece business improved compared to the third quarter as the market-imposed restrictions were largely lifted, although revenue was still below prior year levels. 
North America revenue was flat or increased 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. U.S. outbound continue to deliver strong growth in the quarter, driven primarily by sends [ph] to Mexico and Latin America. Our Mexico business again grew faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for both the fourth quarter and full year. The domestic money transfer business produced improved trends in the quarter as transactions increased 8% while revenue growth turned positive with a 2% increase. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 5% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 1%. Similar to the third quarter, declines in Angola and other African countries offset growth in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6% or up 1% constant currency, while transactions in the region decreased 5% and continued weakness in the Philippines was partially offset by good growth in Japan and China. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 2% or increased 5% constant currency, while transactions increased 7% in the quarter. The region's constant currency growth was primarily driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 21% in the quarter or 25% constant currency. Westernunion.com transactions increased 28% with U.S. originated online transactions growing 35%. Electronic channels revenue, which includes wu.com, account-based money transfer through bank and mobile money transfer, represented 7% of total company revenue in the quarter. 
I do want to mention that we will be making a slight change to our regional reporting for C2C in the first quarter. Rather than separating the westernunion.com business from the regions, we will begin reporting it within the regional numbers splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions. With online transactions right now in 34 countries, we believe this will give a better perspective on total regional performance, while we will still continue to provide the westernunion.com standalone metrics as additional information. 
Turning back to the fourth quarter, in the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 4% or 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 8% on a constant currency basis. This revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products. The consolidated operating profit margin was 20.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 19.6% in the prior year period. The operating margin benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and from foreign exchange hedge gains. These benefits were partially offset by higher technology expense in the quarter. We recorded approximately $21 million of hedge gains on our revenue and profit lines in the current period, up from $9 million of gains in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our cost savings initiatives. We had approximately $11 million of expenses in the quarter on actions to drive future cost efficiencies, which compares to approximately $30 million of such expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, prior cost savings initiatives contributed approximately $6 million of incremental savings in the fourth quarter and full year total savings were approximately $32 million. Technology spending and investment increased compared to the prior year as we invested enhancements to our platforms, digital capabilities, settlement systems and data center transformation, all of which will continue in 2016. Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.6% in the prior year period, while the full year compliance expense was 3.6% of revenue. EBITDA margin of 25.4% in the quarter increased from 24.5% in the prior year period. Our tax rate was 10.4%, an increase from 6.1% in last year's fourth quarter, which benefited from various nonrecurring items. 
For the full year, our reported tax rate was 11%. Excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement charges in the second quarter, the full year effective tax rate was 11.8%. Earnings per share in the quarter was flat with last year at $0.42 and increased operating profit and fewer diluted shares outstanding were offset by the increased tax rate. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 24% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The C2C operating margin also benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and foreign exchange hedge gains, which were partially offset by higher technology expense. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.9% in the quarter compared to 14.2% in the prior year period. The margin decrease is due to the higher local currency expenses in Argentina, including various inflation adjustments and increased technology expense, which were partially offset by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives.
Business Solutions reported operating profit of $4 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $5 million in the same period last year. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in both the current and prior year quarters. EBITDA margins for Business Solutions improved to 16.2% compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion for the year. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth quarter and $267 million for the year, which equates to just under 5% of revenues. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.3 billion. The company utilized U.S. cash to pay out the $250 million debt maturity during the fourth quarter. As a result, approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities as of quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $69 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $712 million at year-end. The outstanding share count at the end of the year was 502 million shares. We also paid $78 million in dividends in the quarter, and we're pleased to announce today the further 3% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
Turning to the 2016 outlook. As Hikmet mentioned, we expect continued steady constant currency results from retail money transfer and good performance from our growth such as westernunion.com. We expect the C2C pricing environment to remain stable with strategic pricing adjustments similar to last year. Our money transfer consumers have been resilient, which has given us a reliable business model and solid earnings and cash flow generation even in some difficult economic time periods. Our outlook does reflect a challenging macroeconomic environment in many parts of the world and negative impact from the stronger dollar relative to 2015 average rates. 
Specifically, we anticipate foreign currency changes and reduced hedge benefits will negatively impact revenues by approximately $250 million and operating profit by approximately $100 million compared to 2015 rates including the impact of hedges. The outlook is primarily based on recent exchange rates with the euro assumed at $1.08. The estimated $100 million profit impact results from just over $25 million of reduced hedge benefits compared to 2015, approximately $25 million related to Argentina and the remainder from translation of profits in various currencies around the world. We expect the benefit of approximately $50 million from foreign exchange currency hedge gains in 2016, but this is down from the $78 million of benefit achieved in 2015. So the year-on-year impact on profit and margins from hedges is negative. 
In Argentina, the peso devalued in late December as new economic policies were implemented, and its value is now more than 30% lower than the average rates for 2015. We have both money transfer and bill payments businesses in Argentina, which represent about 4% of company revenues last year. So the devaluation translates to approximately $100 million of revenue impact and approximately $25 million of operating profit impact. We expect compliance expense in a range of 3.5% to 4%, which is similar to last year. 
The margin outlook also reflects over $50 million of incremental technology expense as we make further investments in our capability. Otherwise, given the challenges from currency, we are managing expenses very tightly. Excluding all impacts from foreign exchange rate movements, the outlook for operating margins in 2016 would be similar to 2015. Achieving our outlook operating margin in 2016 would mark the fourth consecutive year of margins around 20%, with currency contributing to the step up to 21% in 2015 and driving the anticipated step back to approximately 20% this year. 
We have worked hard to stabilize margins over the last few years and what has been a relatively low growth reported revenue environment compared with rising compliance cost, and we are pleased with our progress. We expect the tax rate to increase from 11.8% in 2015, excluding the Paymap charge to mid-teens level in 2016. And we expect the rate to be somewhat higher in the first half of the year than the second. Putting this all together, our initial 2016 outlook calls for low to mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth with GAAP revenue of approximately 400 basis points lower than the constant currency growth; operating margin of approximately 20%; earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70 which includes an approximately $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange and also reflects the impact of higher tax rate; and cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1 billion. 
Similar to last year, the cash flow outlook excludes approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to IRS agreement, some or all of which may occur in late 2016. We anticipate completing the remaining $712 million of our buyback authorization over the course of 2016 and 2017. And we also plan to issue additional debt to at least partially repay the $1 billion note matured in 2016. 
So to summarize, we were pleased with our -- to deliver our results in 2015 despite a tough environment. We expect to drive stable performance and continued strong cash flow generation and allocation in 2016, while we execute our strategies to drive long-term growth. So with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions."

Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continue to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter transferred generally similar to the fourth quarter. Our consumer money transfer business posted steady results consumer bill payments business provided good constant currency revenue growth and Business Solutions increased as well. 
Although, the stronger dollar continued to impact reported results, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter in constant currency terms. In consumer money transfer, westernunion.com and Germany continue to provide good growth, although we did see some software business in the oil-dependent markets. 
Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 6% in the quarter and consumer bill payments increased 12%. Operating margins were a healthy 19.9% despite increases in technology investment and negative impacts from currency. We also continue to generate strong cash flow and returned over $300 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividend and share repurchases. the year is starting as expected. As we think about the next several years, as we highlighted at our Investor Day in March, our focus is on maintaining leadership in the traditional retail money transfer business, expanding leadership in digital money transfer and averaging our cross border platform to sell new used cases and customer segments. 
Our traditional retail business continues to deliver steady results and we are making progress on our global digital initiatives. A few digital examples of this year include: the launch of our mobile app for westernunion.com in Italy, which will allow Android and Apple users to access our money transfer services; and refresh mobile app in the U.K.; and new mobile receiving service in Bangladesh reached launched with MasterCard, cash and direct bank; 2 new Western Union sites in Europe, raising our total 36 countries globally with online money transfer sending services. 
In Western Union Business Solutions, we introduced a new service brings buyers and sellers together on one digital B2B platform, where they can easily arrange and complete cross-border invoicing and payments. The platform also provide foreign exchange and cash management tools for users. In addition, as we previously announced, we added the Viber, social messaging app to our WU Connect platform this year. Viber has been in better mode until last week, but we now added account pay out capabilities and are excited to begin our full launch to build awareness and drive usage. We also remain focused on expanding our paying options and account payout network and initiating more corridor connections to bank accounts. 
I have spent a lot of time over the last several weeks traveling throughout Europe and Asia including attending the European Money 2020 conference in reinforce believe the importance of the end-to-end capabilities that we have seen providing in cross-border money movement and in our ability to leverage our assets for more funding and funds out used cases. I saw an example of this China, where we work with China Pay to offer cross-border payment for business customers in the country. We also provide many other digital service in China with Western Union Money transfer available on several online and mobile banking platforms. 
Our collaborations in China and all other examples I have mentioned, further comments that our services can provide very valuable connection to partners whether they are financial institutions, social media or messaging companies, mobile operators or more traditional retailers. So we see many opportunities, and I believe, we have the right strategy to address them. Thus far in 2016, our business performance has been solid and we are on track with our full year expectations, while we continue to make progress on our long-term strategies. Now to discuss the first quarter results in more detail, I would like to turn the call over to Raj"

Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter results. This quarter revenues of $1.3 billion, increased 3% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $57 million compared to the prior year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenues increased 1% in the quarter and reported revenues declined 2%, while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and continued to strengthen U.S. outbound, particularly to Mexico and Latin America. The total C2C cross-border principal declined 2% compared to the prior year period or increased 1% constant currency.
Principal per transaction was down 5% or down 3% in constant currency terms, with a decline driven by several oil-related markets. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points, including a negative 3% impact from currency. We continue to view the global pricing environment as very stable. The impact of net price increases of 2% in the quarter, but this was primarily related to Argentina, where significant reductions on our outbound pricing in response to the economic and currency deterioration in the country and from the actions we took in our U.S. domestic money transfer business since April of last year. 
Outside of these 2 actions, pricing impact would have been neutral in the quarter and mix was also neutral. Turning to the regions. As we did last year, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. Also as previously mentioned, we have made a change to our C2C regional reporting effective in the first quarter. We are now including the westernunion.com business within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue between 50-50 sand and regions, which is consistent with how we treat to the retail business. 
The convertible quarterly numbers for 2015 can be found in our earnings release and we will also continue to report westernunion.com revenue and transaction growth rate at supplemental information. In the quarter, North America revenue grew 3% or 5% on an constant-currency basis while transactions increased 7%. The region benefited from strong growth in U.S. outbound to Mexico and Latin America with our Mexico business again outpacing the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for the first quarter. 
Total domestic money transfer revenue was flat in the quarter, transaction growth of 5%. In the European CIS region, revenue declined 3% and was flat on a constant-currency basis, while transaction increased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, Germany delivered strong growth, but the positive impact was offset by continued weakness in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 3%. Low oil prices are affecting the region's results as many Gulf states have experienced slowdown in the investment in hiring. The main declines were from Nigeria, where the inbound business has been affected by a wide divergence between market exchange rates and the official rates, resulting from oil impact on the economy. 
Saudi Arabia revenues increased, but trends were not as strong as previous quarters. In Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or down 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 4%, primarily due to continued weakness in the Philippines. In addition, some markets in Asia have negatively impacted by from lower from the oil-producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 5%, but increased 1% constant currency. Transactions increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue was driven -- revenue growth was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., but this was largely offset by the pricing directions in Argentina. Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which included in the regional numbers as discussed, grew 16% in the quarter or 18% constant currency and represented 7% of total C2C revenue. 
Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with the U.S. originated online transactions going 28%. Mobile continues to be a fast-growing area for wu.com with our 55% U.S. transactions being initiated on a mobile device in the quarter. The online business was also gaining traction on cents 2 accounts through our expanding account payout network. The spread between transaction revenue growth for wu.com in the quarter was primarily due to lower principal per transaction and other mix. This was driven by the high growth in mobile transactions, which tend to have a smaller principal amount. 
As Hikmet mentioned, we have online transactions in 36 countries, which allow us to present over 200 countries in territory. And we expect strong growth from wu.com as the year progresses as we expand our present and further enhance our service offering. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1%, but increased 12% on a constant-currency basis. Driven by growth in Argentina and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Depreciation of the Argentina peso drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenue. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 6% on a constant-currency basis, by strong sales of hedging products in Europe. The consolidated operating profit margin was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior year period. As expected, the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which was partially offset by benefits from cost-savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. 
Hedge gains in the quarter was similar to the prior year with $15 million of gains in the current quarter compared to $16 million of gains in the first quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to prior year. Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue compared to 3.8% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 25% in the quarter compared to 25.5% in the prior year period and as expected our tax rate of 14.6% increased from 12.3% in the first quarter of last year. 
In combination with share repurchase, these results generated earnings per share of $0.37, down slightly from $0.39 a year ago. The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7% compared to 23.1% in the prior-year period. The C2C operating margin was negatively impacted by higher technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost-savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 14.6% in the quarter compared to 18.7% in the prior year period, with the decrease primary due to increased technology expense. Business Solutions operating profit of $2 million was consistent with the prior year period, while EBITDA margins improved from 14.6% to 15.1%. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $213 million for the quarter, while capital expenses were $48 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities. In the first quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 13 million shares or a total of $240 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $472 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of March was 492,000,000 shares. Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are reaffirming our full year outlook -- financial outlook for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We've maintained our constant currency revenue outlook a low to mid-single-digit increase. Operating margin at approximately 20% and earnings per share in the range of $1.58 to $1.70. The GAAP revenue now expected to be approximately $50 million higher than our initial outlook based on the recent strengthening of several currencies against the U.S. dollar. Compared to 2015 rates, we now expect currency to have a negative impact on revenues of approximately $200 million for the full year. This equates to a GAAP revenue changes 300 basis points lower than the constant currency increase, rather than the 400 basis points in the prior outlook. The impact on operating profit from the increased revenues is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in hedge benefits with hedge gains now projected at approximately $40 million compared to $50 million in the prior outlook. 
The new projection for totally new impact in operating profit from currency net of hedges is now at approximately $90 million, a slight improvement from the approximately $100 million negative impact anticipated in our prior outlook. Since EPS -- since the impact on EPS was relatively small and we are still early in the year, we did not change our EPS outlook. As exchange rates stabilized or move during the year, we will up update our outlook accordingly. So to summarize, our first quarter results were solid and we are on track for the year. Cash flow and balance sheet remain strong and we continue to return significant funds to stakeholders. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

Technology was one of them and then we had some negative foreign exchange impact and then we have some benefits from cost-savings and timing and expenses as well. The technology expense we said when we came into the year that we expect to spend well over $50 million incrementally on technology and that's on a base of few hundred million dollars. So if you just take that in each quarter, that's roughly -- the some of the letter quarters will start to go over, if you will. But in total for the year, we see over $50 million of incremental spend on technology. And then, some of the cost-savings, if you recall we took about $11 million of cost in the fourth quarter and there's going to translate to a few million dollars of the savings this year. And then we also are just managing the business very tightly and efficiently on the expense side and we've also had some time and expenses while they helped us in the first quarter. So the primary negative impact was around technology, which again for the year will be well over $50 million incrementally and then some of the negative foreign exchange impact."

And it's a little bit lower principal amount respect a little bit revenue per transaction was lower. But generally, that's the direction. I am also excited about the new social media partnership like Viber. Let's see where it goes. It's too early to tell that. But, I believe, that this does will be growth on C2C. And digital to connection to 200 countries. Digital connection to retail, distal connection to our account payout network, which we are more than 1 billion accounts that will come to growth, that will accelerate over the few quarters, I believe. On retail money transfer, I think that, that will continue to be flattish. It will continue to be slow. And -- but I think the team is doing a great job there also keeping the retail money transfer very strong. In fact, recently today, I just saw the Mexico numbers came out and we are winning. I saw again market share there. So that's the thing -- but the global economy for all countries like Russia, like Saudi Arabia has a little bit impact to our growth, and that's I would be cautious there. Other side, the Germany did very well. Within -- even within the Gulf states, UAE did very well. I mean, that's differentiate country-by-country."

And so it's going to continue. That's the beauty of being in 200 countries, having that portfolio that we have and just say it again anyway, you know it anyway, but none of our countries out of the U.S. are bigger than 7% of our revenue, so which means that we have really reached portfolio some of the countries, which we call it out has less than 1% of the revenue.

So I believe, that given our fundamentals, given our global reach, we do have a quite good expansion. We are growing very fast. We are winning market share here. And so comparing with that, I think also there is still growth opportunities that we can capture growth opportunities with new customer segments, but also on the financial institution, more and more financial institutions are looking at us, saying that can you process the transactions from the U.S., Vietnam or from Germany to Peru and all this things with our compliance program, with our platforms, we can expand our opportunities here.

Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the fourth quarter. Our consumer money transfer business posted steady results. The consumer bill payments business provided good constant currency revenue growth, and Business Solutions increased as well. Although the stronger dollar continued to impact reported results, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter in constant currency terms. 
In consumer money transfer, westernunion.com, U.S. outbound and Germany continued to provide good growth, although we did see some softer business in the oil-dependent markets. Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 6% in the quarter, and consumer bill payments increased 12%.
Operating margins were a healthy 19.9% despite increases in technology investment and negative impacts from currency. We also continue to generate strong cash flow and returned over $300 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividend and share repurchases.
So the year is starting as expected. As we think about the next several years, as we highlighted at our Investor Day in March, our focus is on maintaining leadership in the traditional retail money transfer business, expanding leadership in digital money transfer and leveraging our cross-border platform to serve new use cases and customer segments.
Our traditional retail business continues to deliver steady results, and we are making progress on our global digital initiatives. A few digital examples this year include: the launch of our mobile app for westernunion.com in Italy, which will allow Android and Apple users to access our money transfer services; a refreshed mobile app in the U.K.; a new mobile remittance receiving service in Bangladesh, which was launched with MasterCard, bKash and BRAC Bank; 2 new westernunion.com transaction sites in Europe, raising our total to 36 countries globally with online money transfer sending services.
In Western Union Business Solutions, we introduced WU EDGE, a new service that brings buyers and sellers together on one digital B2B platform where they can easily arrange and complete cross-border invoicing and payments. The platform also provides added foreign exchange and cash management tools for users. In addition, as we previously announced, we added the Viber social messaging app to our WU Connect platform this year. Viber has been in beta mode until last week, but we now added account payout capabilities and are excited to begin our full launch to build awareness and drive usage. We also remain focused on expanding our paying options and account payout network and initiating more corridor connections to bank accounts.
I have spent a lot of time over the last several weeks traveling throughout Europe and Asia, including attending the European Money20/20 conference in Copenhagen. These trips reinforce my belief in the importance of the end-to-end capabilities that we have seen in providing cross-border money movement and in our ability to leverage our assets for more funds-in and funds-out use cases.
I saw an example of this in China, where we work with ChinaPay to offer fast cross-border payments for business customers in the country. We also provide many other digital services in China with Western Union money transfer available on several online and mobile banking platforms. Our collaborations in China and all other examples I have mentioned further convince me that our services can provide very valuable connections to partners, whether they are financial institutions, social media or messaging companies, mobile operators or more traditional retailers.
So we see many opportunities, and I believe we have the right strategies to address them. Thus far in 2016, our business performance has been solid and we are on track with our full year expectations while we continue to make progress on our long-term strategies.
Now to discuss the first quarter results in more detail, I would like to turn the call over to Raj."
909408,330256619,971687,"The Western Union Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter results. This quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stro",1593,"Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter results. This quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $57 million compared to the prior year period.
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenues increased 1% in the quarter and reported revenues declined 2% while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and continued strength in U.S. outbound, particularly to Mexico and Latin America. The total C2C cross-border principal declined 2% compared to the prior year period or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 5% or down 3% in constant currency terms, with the decline driven by several oil-related markets. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points, including a negative 3% impact from currency.
We continue to view the global pricing environment as very stable. The impact of net price decreases was 2% in the quarter, but this was primarily related to Argentina, where we took significant reductions on our outbound pricing in response to the economic and currency deterioration in the country, and from the actions we took in our U.S. domestic money transfer business in April of last year. Outside of these 2 actions, our pricing impact would have been neutral in the quarter and mix was also neutral.
Turning to the regions. As we did last year, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. Also as previously mentioned, we have made a change to our C2C regional reporting effective in the first quarter. We are now including the westernunion.com business within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions, which is consistent with how we treat the retail business. The comparable quarterly numbers for 2015 can be found in our earnings release attachments, and we will also continue to report westernunion.com revenue and transaction growth rate at supplemental information.
In the quarter, North America revenue grew 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 7%. The region benefited from strong growth in U.S. outbound to Mexico and Latin America, with our Mexico business again outpacing the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for the first quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue was flat in the quarter on transaction growth of 5%.
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% and was flat on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, Germany delivered strong growth, but the positive impact was offset by continued weakness in Russia.
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 3%. Lower oil prices are affecting the region's results as many Gulf states have experienced slowdown in investment and hiring. The main declines were from Nigeria, where the inbound business has been affected by a wide divergence between market exchange rates and official rates resulting from oil's impact on the economy. Saudi Arabia revenues increased, but trends were not as strong as previous quarters.
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or down 1% constant currency while transactions decreased 4%, primarily due to continued weakness in the Philippines. In addition, some receive markets in Asia have been negatively impacted by from lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 5% but increased 1% constant currency. Transactions increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue was driven -- revenue growth was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., but this was largely offset by the pricing reductions in Argentina.
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers as discussed, grew 16% in the quarter or 18% constant currency and represented 7% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25%, with the U.S. originated online transactions growing 28%.
Mobile continues to be a fast-growing area for wu.com with our 55% U.S. transactions being initiated on a mobile device in the quarter.
The online business was also gaining good traction on sends to accounts through our expanding account payout network. The spread between transaction revenue growth for wu.com in the quarter was primarily due to lower principal per transaction and other mix. This was driven by the high growth in mobile transactions, which tend to have a smaller principal amount. As Hikmet mentioned, we have online transaction sites in 36 countries, which allow us to send to over 200 countries and territory. And we expect strong growth from wu.com as the year progresses as we expand our present and further enhance our service offerings.
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1% but increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenue.
Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis, created by strong sales of hedging products in Europe. 
The consolidated operating profit margin was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior year period. As expected, the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. Hedge gains in the quarter were similar to the prior year with $15 million of gains in the current quarter compared to $16 million of gains in the first quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue compared to 3.8% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 25% in the quarter compared to 25.5% in the prior year period, and as expected, our tax rate of 14.6% increased from 12.3% in the first quarter of last year. In combination with share repurchases, these results generated earnings per share of $0.37, down slightly from $0.39 a year ago. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The C2C operating margin was negatively impacted by higher technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost-savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses.
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 14.6% in the quarter compared to 18.7% in the prior year period, with the decrease primary due to increased technology expense.
Business Solutions operating profit of $2 million was consistent with the prior year period, while EBITDA margins improved from 14.6% to 15.1%. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $213 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $48 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities. In the first quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $240 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $472 million at quarter end, and the outstanding share count at the end of March was 492 million shares.
Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full year outlook -- financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We have maintained our constant currency revenue outlook as a low to mid-single-digit increase, operating margin at approximately 20% and earnings per share in the range of $1.58 to $1.70.
The GAAP revenue is now expected to be approximately $50 million higher than our initial outlook based on the recent strengthening of several currencies against the U.S. dollar. Compared to 2015 rates, we now expect currency to have a negative impact on revenues of approximately $200 million for the full year. This equates to a GAAP revenue change of 300 basis points lower than the constant currency increase rather than the 400 basis points in the prior outlook.
The impact on operating profit from the increased revenues is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in hedge benefits with hedge gains now projected at approximately $40 million compared to $50 million in the prior outlook. The new projection for total negative impact in operating profit from currency, net of hedges, is now approximately $90 million, a slight improvement from the approximately $100 million negative impact anticipated in our prior outlook.
Since the EPS -- since the impact on EPS was relatively small and we are still early in the year, we did not change our EPS outlook. As exchange rates stabilize or move during the year, we will update our outlook accordingly.
So to summarize, our first quarter results were solid and we are on track for the year. Cash flow and balance sheet remain strong, and we continue to return significant funds to stakeholders.

The operating margin was impacted by a few things. Technology was one of them.

The technology expense, we said when we came into the year that we expected to spend well over $50 million incrementally on technology, and that's on a base of a few hundred million dollars. So if you just take that in each quarter, that's roughly -- the impact -- some of the later quarters will start to go over, if you will. But in total for the year, we see over $50 million of incremental spend on technology. And then some of the cost-savings, if you recall, we had -- we took about $11 million of cost in the fourth quarter. And that's going to translate to a few million dollars of savings this year. And then we also are just managing the business very tightly and efficiently on the expense side, and we've also had some timing of expenses as well that helped us in the first quarter. So the primary negative impact was around technology, which again for the year will be well over $50 million incrementally and then some of the negative foreign exchange impact."

And within that -- within the digital is the mobile. 55% of our transaction in the U.S. are initiated by mobile phones. And it's a little bit lower principal amount, respect of a little bit revenue per transaction. It was lower. But generally, that's the direction. I am also excited about the new social media partnership like Viber. Let's see where it goes. It's too early to tell that. But I believe that the digital is the -- will bring the growth on C2C. And digital connection to 200 countries. Digital connection to retail. Digital connection to our account payout network, which we are more than 1 billion accounts. That will come to growth. That will accelerate over the few quarters, I believe. On retail money transfer, I think that, that will continue to be flattish. It will continue to be slow. And -- but I think the team is doing a great job there, also keeping the retail money transfer very strong. In fact, recently -- today, I just saw the Mexico numbers came out and we are winning. I saw again market share there. So that's the thing -- but the global economy, the oil-producing countries like Russia, like Saudi Arabia has a little bit impact to our growth, and that's -- I would be cautious there.

Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the",647,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the fourth quarter. Our consumer money transfer business posted steady results. The consumer bill payments business provided good constant currency revenue growth, and Business Solutions increased as well. Although the stronger dollar continued to impact reported results, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter in constant currency terms. 
In consumer money transfer, westernunion.com, U.S. outbound and Germany continued to provide good growth, although we did see some softer business in the oil-dependent markets. Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 6% in the quarter, and consumer bill payments increased 12%.
Operating margins were a healthy 19.9% despite increases in technology investment and negative impacts from currency. We also continued to generate strong cash flow and returned over $300 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividend and share repurchases.
So the year is starting as expected. As we think about the next several years, as we highlighted at our Investor Day in March, our focus is on maintaining leadership in the traditional retail money transfer business, expanding leadership in digital money transfer and leveraging our cross-border platform to serve new use cases and customer segments.
Our traditional retail business continues to deliver steady results, and we are making progress on our global digital initiatives. A few digital examples this year include: the launch of our mobile app for westernunion.com in Italy, which will allow Android and Apple users to access our money transfer services; a refreshed mobile app in the U.K.; a new mobile remittance receiving service in Bangladesh, which was launched with MasterCard, bKash and BRAC Bank; 2 new westernunion.com transaction sites in Europe, raising our total to 36 countries globally with online money transfer sending services.
In Western Union Business Solutions, we introduced WU EDGE, a new service that brings buyers and sellers together on one digital B2B platform where they can easily arrange and complete cross-border invoicing and payment. The platform also provides added foreign exchange and cash management tools for users. In addition, as we previously announced, we added the Viber social messaging app to our WU Connect platform this year. Viber has been in beta mode until last week, but we now added account payout capabilities and are excited to begin a full launch to build awareness and drive usage. We also remain focused on expanding our paying options and account payout network and initiating more corridor connections to bank accounts.
I have spent a lot of time over the last several weeks traveling throughout Europe and Asia, including attending the European Money20/20 conference in Copenhagen. These trips reinforce my belief in the importance of the end-to-end capabilities that we have seen in providing cross-border money movement and in our ability to leverage our assets for more funds-in and funds-out use cases.
I saw an example of this in China, where we work with ChinaPay to offer fast cross-border payments for business customers in the country. We also provide many other digital services in China with Western Union money transfer available on several online and mobile banking platforms. Our collaborations in China and all other examples I have mentioned further convince me that our services can provide very valuable connections to partners, whether they are financial institutions, social media or messaging companies, mobile operators or more traditional retailers.
So we see many opportunities, and I believe we have the right strategies to address them. Thus far in 2016, our business performance has been solid and we are on track with our full year expectations while we continue to make progress on our long-term strategies.
Now to discuss the first quarter results in more detail, I would like to turn the call over to Raj."
909408,330256619,971739,"The Western Union Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter result. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stro",1593,"Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter result. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $57 million compared to the prior year period.
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenues increased 1% in the quarter and reported revenues declined 2% while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and continued strength in U.S. outbound, particularly to Mexico and Latin America. The total C2C cross-border principal declined 2% compared to the prior year period or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 5% or down 3% in constant currency terms, with the decline driven by several oil-related markets. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points, including a negative 3% impact from currency.
We continue to view the global pricing environment as very stable. The impact of net price decreases was 2% in the quarter, but this was primarily related to Argentina, where we took significant reductions on our outbound pricing in response to the economic and currency deterioration in the country, and from the actions we took in our U.S. domestic money transfer business in April of last year. Outside of these 2 actions, the pricing impact would have been neutral in the quarter and mix was also neutral.
Turning to the regions. As we did last year, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. Also as previously mentioned, we have made a change to our C2C regional reporting effective in the first quarter. We are now including the westernunion.com business within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions, which is consistent with how we treat the retail business. The comparable quarterly numbers for 2015 can be found in our earnings release attachments, and we will also continue to report westernunion.com revenue and transaction growth rate as supplemental information.
In the quarter, North America revenue grew 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 7%. The region benefited from strong growth in U.S. outbound to Mexico and Latin America, with our Mexico business again outpacing the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for the first quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue was flat in the quarter on transaction growth of 5%.
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% and was flat on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, Germany delivered strong growth, but the positive impact was offset by continued weakness in Russia.
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 3%. Lower oil prices are affecting the region's results as many Gulf states have experienced slowdowns in investment and hiring. The main declines were from Nigeria, where the inbound business has been affected by a wide divergence between market exchange rates and official rates, resulting from oil's impact on the economy. Saudi Arabia revenues increased, but trends were not as strong as previous quarters.
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or down 1% constant currency while transactions decreased 4%, primarily due to continued weakness in the Philippines. In addition, some receive markets in Asia have been negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 5% but increased 1% constant currency. Transactions increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue was driven -- revenue growth was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., but this was largely offset by the pricing reductions in Argentina.
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 16% in the quarter or 18% constant currency and represented 7% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25%, with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 28%.
Mobile continues to be a fast-growing area for wu.com with our 55% of U.S. transactions being initiated on a mobile device in the quarter.
The online business is also gaining good traction on sends to accounts through our expanding account payout network. The spread between transaction revenue growth for wu.com in the quarter was primarily due to lower principal per transaction and other mix. This was driven by the high growth in mobile transactions, which tend to have a smaller principal amount. As Hikmet mentioned, we now have online transaction sites in 36 countries, which allow us to send to over 200 countries and territories. And we expect strong growth from wu.com as the year progresses as we expand our presence and further enhance our service offerings.
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1% but increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenue.
Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis, created by strong sales of hedging products in Europe. 
The consolidated operating profit margin was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior year period. As expected, the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. Hedge gains in the quarter were similar to the prior year with $15 million of gains in the current quarter compared to $16 million of gains in the first quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue compared to 3.8% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 25% in the quarter compared to 25.5% in the prior year period, and as expected, our tax rate of 14.6% increased from 12.3% in the first quarter of last year. In combination with share repurchases, these results generated earnings per share of $0.37, down slightly from $0.39 a year ago. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The C2C operating margin was negatively impacted by higher technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost-savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses.
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 14.6% in the quarter compared to 18.7% in the prior year period, with the decrease primarily due to increased technology expense.
Business Solutions operating profit of $2 million was consistent with the prior year period, while EBITDA margins improved from 14.6% to 15.1%. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $213 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $48 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities. In the first quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $240 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $472 million at quarter end, and the outstanding share count at the end of March was 492 million shares.
Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full year outlook -- financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We have maintained our constant currency revenue outlook as a low to mid-single-digit increase, operating margin at approximately 20% and earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70.
The GAAP revenue is now expected to be approximately $50 million higher than our initial outlook, based on the recent strengthening of several currencies against the U.S. dollar. Compared to 2015 rates, we now expect currency to have a negative impact on revenues of approximately $200 million for the full year. This equates to a GAAP revenue change of 300 basis points lower than the constant currency increase rather than the 400 basis points in the prior outlook.
The impact on operating profit from the increased revenue is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in hedge benefits, with hedge gains now projected at approximately $40 million compared to $50 million in the prior outlook. The new projection for total negative impact on operating profit from currency, net of hedges, is now approximately $90 million, a slight improvement from the approximately $100 million negative impact anticipated in our prior outlook.
Since the EPS -- since the impact on EPS was relatively small and we are still early in the year, we did not change our EPS outlook. As exchange rates stabilize or move during the year, we will update our outlook accordingly.
So to summarize, our first quarter results were solid and we are on track for the year. Cash flow and the balance sheet remain strong, and we continue to return significant funds to stakeholders.

So if you just take that in each quarter, that's roughly -- the impact -- some of the later quarters will start to go over, if you will. But in total for the year, we see over $50 million of incremental spend on technology. And then some of the cost savings, if you recall, we had -- we took about $11 million of cost in the fourth quarter. And that's going to translate to a few million dollars of savings this year. And then we also are just managing the business very tightly and efficiently on the expense side, and we've also had some timing of expenses as well that helped us in the first quarter. So the primary negative impact was around technology, which again for the year will be well over $50 million incrementally and then some of the negative foreign exchange impact."

And it's a little bit lower principal amount; in respect of a little bit revenue per transaction, it was lower. But generally, that's the direction. I am also excited about the new social media partnership like Viber. Let's see where it goes. It's too early to tell that. But I believe that the digital is the -- will bring the growth on the C2C. And digital connection to 200 countries. Digital connection to retail. Digital connection to our account payout network, which we are more than 1 billion accounts. That will come to growth. That will accelerate over the few quarters, I believe. On retail money transfer, I think that, that will continue to be flattish. It will continue to be slow. And -- but I think the team is doing a great job there, also keeping the retail money transfer very strong. In fact, recently -- today, I just saw the Mexico numbers came out and we are winning. I saw again market share there. So that's the thing -- but the global economy, the oil-producing countries like Russia, like Saudi Arabia, has a little bit impact to our growth, and that's -- I would be cautious there. Other side, Germany did very well. We didn't even -- within the Gulf states, UAE did well. I mean, that's really differentiated country by country."

And I believe that we are really seeing -- looking at the numbers and comparing with the competition and comparing with our prices, we are really leading the industry here, and the team in San Francisco and my team is doing a good job. There will be always a competition on the -- technical competition on the corridor by corridor. I recently was in Copenhagen at Money20/20. There are a lot of FinTech companies coming with ideas, but nobody can really offer the end-to-end solution. No one of them can say that, okay, you can send money from 36 countries on mobile or mini mobile app to 200 countries and pick up the money in minutes and do the compliance and pay out in 131 currencies and for a good price. So that's definitely the technology. We are looking at it. That's definitely the way we are investing. That's definitely the way we are upgrading our technology."

Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the",647,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the fourth quarter. Our consumer money transfer business posted steady results. The consumer bill payments business provided good constant currency revenue growth, and Business Solutions increased as well. Although the stronger dollar continued to impact reported results, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter in constant currency terms. 
In consumer money transfer, westernunion.com, U.S. outbound and Germany continued to provide good growth, although we did see some softer business in the oil-dependent markets. Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 6% in the quarter, and consumer bill payments increased 12%.
Operating margins were a healthy 19.9% despite increases in technology investment and negative impacts from currency. We also continued to generate strong cash flow and returned over $300 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividend and share repurchases.
So the year is starting as expected. As we think about the next several years, as we highlighted at our Investor Day in March, our focus is on maintaining leadership in the traditional retail money transfer business, expanding leadership in digital money transfer and leveraging our cross-border platform to serve new use cases and customer segments.
Our traditional retail business continues to deliver steady results, and we are making progress on our global digital initiatives. A few digital examples this year include: the launch of our mobile app for westernunion.com in Italy, which will allow Android and Apple users to access our money transfer services; a refreshed mobile app in the U.K.; a new mobile remittance receiving service in Bangladesh, which was launched with MasterCard, bKash and BRAC Bank; 2 new westernunion.com transaction sites in Europe, raising our total to 36 countries globally with online money transfer sending services.
In Western Union Business Solutions, we introduced WU EDGE, a new service that brings buyers and sellers together on one digital B2B platform where they can easily arrange and complete cross-border invoicing and payment. The platform also provides added foreign exchange and cash management tools for users. In addition, as we previously announced, we added the Viber social messaging app to our WU Connect platform this year. Viber has been in beta mode until last week, but we now added account payout capabilities and are excited to begin a full launch to build awareness and drive usage. We also remain focused on expanding our paying options and account payout network and initiating more corridor connections to bank accounts.
I have spent a lot of time over the last several weeks traveling throughout Europe and Asia, including attending the European Money20/20 conference in Copenhagen. These trips reinforce my belief in the importance of the end-to-end capabilities that we have seen in providing cross-border money movement and in our ability to leverage our assets for more funds-in and funds-out use cases.
I saw an example of this in China, where we work with ChinaPay to offer fast cross-border payments for business customers in the country. We also provide many other digital services in China with Western Union money transfer available on several online and mobile banking platforms. Our collaborations in China and all other examples I have mentioned further convince me that our services can provide very valuable connections to partners, whether they are financial institutions, social media or messaging companies, mobile operators or more traditional retailers.
So we see many opportunities, and I believe we have the right strategies to address them. Thus far in 2016, our business performance has been solid and we are on track with our full year expectations while we continue to make progress on our long-term strategies.
Now to discuss the first quarter results in more detail, I would like to turn the call over to Raj."
909408,330256619,971747,"The Western Union Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter result. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stro",1593,"Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter result. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $57 million compared to the prior year period.
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenues increased 1% in the quarter and reported revenues declined 2% while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and continued strength in U.S. outbound, particularly to Mexico and Latin America. The total C2C cross-border principal declined 2% compared to the prior year period or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 5% or down 3% in constant currency terms, with the decline driven by several oil-related markets. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points, including a negative 3% impact from currency.
We continue to view the global pricing environment as very stable. The impact of net price decreases was 2% in the quarter, but this was primarily related to Argentina, where we took significant reductions on our outbound pricing in response to the economic and currency deterioration in the country, and from the actions we took in our U.S. domestic money transfer business in April of last year. Outside of these 2 actions, the pricing impact would have been neutral in the quarter and mix was also neutral.
Turning to the regions. As we did last year, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. Also as previously mentioned, we have made a change to our C2C regional reporting effective in the first quarter. We are now including the westernunion.com business within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions, which is consistent with how we treat the retail business. The comparable quarterly numbers for 2015 can be found in our earnings release attachments, and we will also continue to report westernunion.com revenue and transaction growth rate as supplemental information.
In the quarter, North America revenue grew 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 7%. The region benefited from strong growth in U.S. outbound to Mexico and Latin America, with our Mexico business again outpacing the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for the first quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue was flat in the quarter on transaction growth of 5%.
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% and was flat on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, Germany delivered strong growth, but the positive impact was offset by continued weakness in Russia.
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 3%. Lower oil prices are affecting the region's results as many Gulf states have experienced slowdowns in investment and hiring. The main declines were from Nigeria, where the inbound business has been affected by a wide divergence between market exchange rates and official rates, resulting from oil's impact on the economy. Saudi Arabia revenues increased, but trends were not as strong as previous quarters.
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or down 1% constant currency while transactions decreased 4%, primarily due to continued weakness in the Philippines. In addition, some receive markets in Asia have been negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 5% but increased 1% constant currency. Transactions increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue was driven -- revenue growth was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., but this was largely offset by the pricing reductions in Argentina.
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 16% in the quarter or 18% constant currency and represented 7% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25%, with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 28%.
Mobile continues to be a fast-growing area for wu.com with our 55% of U.S. transactions being initiated on a mobile device in the quarter.
The online business is also gaining good traction on sends to accounts through our expanding account payout network. The spread between transaction revenue growth for wu.com in the quarter was primarily due to lower principal per transaction and other mix. This was driven by the high growth in mobile transactions, which tend to have a smaller principal amount. As Hikmet mentioned, we now have online transaction sites in 36 countries, which allow us to send to over 200 countries and territories. And we expect strong growth from wu.com as the year progresses as we expand our presence and further enhance our service offerings.
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1% but increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenue.
Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis, created by strong sales of hedging products in Europe. 
The consolidated operating profit margin was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior year period. As expected, the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. Hedge gains in the quarter were similar to the prior year with $15 million of gains in the current quarter compared to $16 million of gains in the first quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue compared to 3.8% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 25% in the quarter compared to 25.5% in the prior year period, and as expected, our tax rate of 14.6% increased from 12.3% in the first quarter of last year. In combination with share repurchases, these results generated earnings per share of $0.37, down slightly from $0.39 a year ago. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The C2C operating margin was negatively impacted by higher technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost-savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses.
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 14.6% in the quarter compared to 18.7% in the prior year period, with the decrease primarily due to increased technology expense.
Business Solutions operating profit of $2 million was consistent with the prior year period, while EBITDA margins improved from 14.6% to 15.1%. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year.
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $213 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $48 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities. In the first quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $240 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $472 million at quarter end, and the outstanding share count at the end of March was 492 million shares.
Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full year outlook -- financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We have maintained our constant currency revenue outlook as a low to mid-single-digit increase, operating margin at approximately 20% and earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70.
The GAAP revenue is now expected to be approximately $50 million higher than our initial outlook, based on the recent strengthening of several currencies against the U.S. dollar. Compared to 2015 rates, we now expect currency to have a negative impact on revenues of approximately $200 million for the full year. This equates to a GAAP revenue change of 300 basis points lower than the constant currency increase rather than the 400 basis points in the prior outlook.
The impact on operating profit from the increased revenue is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in hedge benefits, with hedge gains now projected at approximately $40 million compared to $50 million in the prior outlook. The new projection for total negative impact on operating profit from currency, net of hedges, is now approximately $90 million, a slight improvement from the approximately $100 million negative impact anticipated in our prior outlook.
Since the EPS -- since the impact on EPS was relatively small and we are still early in the year, we did not change our EPS outlook. As exchange rates stabilize or move during the year, we will update our outlook accordingly.
So to summarize, our first quarter results were solid and we are on track for the year. Cash flow and the balance sheet remain strong, and we continue to return significant funds to stakeholders.

So if you just take that in each quarter, that's roughly -- the impact -- some of the later quarters will start to go over, if you will. But in total for the year, we see over $50 million of incremental spend on technology. And then some of the cost savings, if you recall, we had -- we took about $11 million of cost in the fourth quarter. And that's going to translate to a few million dollars of savings this year. And then we also are just managing the business very tightly and efficiently on the expense side, and we've also had some timing of expenses as well that helped us in the first quarter. So the primary negative impact was around technology, which again for the year will be well over $50 million incrementally and then some of the negative foreign exchange impact."

And it's a little bit lower principal amount; in respect of a little bit revenue per transaction, it was lower. But generally, that's the direction. I am also excited about the new social media partnership like Viber. Let's see where it goes. It's too early to tell that. But I believe that the digital is the -- will bring the growth on the C2C. And digital connection to 200 countries. Digital connection to retail. Digital connection to our account payout network, which we are more than 1 billion accounts. That will come to growth. That will accelerate over the few quarters, I believe. On retail money transfer, I think that, that will continue to be flattish. It will continue to be slow. And -- but I think the team is doing a great job there, also keeping the retail money transfer very strong. In fact, recently -- today, I just saw the Mexico numbers came out and we are winning. I saw again market share there. So that's the thing -- but the global economy, the oil-producing countries like Russia, like Saudi Arabia, has a little bit impact to our growth, and that's -- I would be cautious there.

We make investments like that from time to time just to stay close to things that are happening in that space.

It allows us to be more nimble in the market, and it also allows us to be better fit to serve digital partners as we add them. And some of these are multiyear programs, right? So they're not going to be done in a 1-year period. They're going to continue on for a couple of years. And so that's really where the spending is geared towards."

I am pleased with our second quarter results and the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environments. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the market money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many or all industry dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continue to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remains a negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many others such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, the U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solutions customers in the U.K. in the [indiscernible] leading up to lead Brexit vote but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts with westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the contents resting in dot-com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat [ph] in the U.S. we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia, so Yandex consumers can now initiate transfers on their forms to Western union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Right Aide in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to rollout enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention the recent announcement that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest boarder settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1023808,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced second quarter revenue by ap",1509,"Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter, or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction are still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. And the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by [indiscernible] Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continue to grow faster than the market based on the latest Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices on additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as we see markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in as our solutions reported revenues increased 3% or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Qs. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of PMAP [ph] settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million from gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the payment settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserve and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reduction in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash at $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017 was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit in the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflected our tax rate and the legal matter accrual.

Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%.

We are still seeing the Argentina impact I mentioned. Secondly, we did grow over the domestic money transfer pricings that we did last year in April, so we're getting a benefit from that. And then third, we did raised some spreads in certain parts of the world. I would say on the spread changes, we have 16,000 corners that we're monitoring pricing activity and pricing levels and we try to optimize those on an ongoing basis. So I wouldn't characterize these as things that stay forever. We may increase spread, we may reduce spreads, it really depends on what those particular markets require.

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many oil industry-dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remained negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means, in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall, in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the country's westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate transfers on their forms to Western union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Right Aide in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention 2 recent announcements that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest Border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage, and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1024191,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period.

Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction were still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business solutions reported revenues increased 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Q. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million of gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the Paymap settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook, as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflected our tax rate and the legal matter accrual. 
Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

So I think that our agent commissions has been favorable for Western Union over the years, as you know. And definitely, the new agreements we signed has not been signing at the rates we signed years ago. Obviously, that helped also. However, I would like to keep and grow my agent network because one of the biggest things we see is that the new customers, which we sign with mobile want to drop money on our retail money transfer, retail locations worldwide, right? We do have, for instance, in India, more than 100,000 locations and you can send money immediately from them -- from your mobile phone immediately to 100,000 locations in India, plus the thousands of millions of millions of accounts in India in a moment. And nobody else can do that, that big, as we can do it, That's a big competitive advantage. Seeing that also, we're always looking for optimization for our sales cost, for our retail costs, and I think that team is working very hard on that. And I think long term, there's definitely some room there to be more efficient."

I would say, the $0.06 that you're calculating is a little bit high. If you -- our new outlook for the tax rate is around 12%, and we had given a mid-teens level. So depending on where -- what you assume for the actual tax rate, you'll have to walk down from that, but I would say, your estimate is a little bit high. And then we have a $0.02 offset to that from the legal accruals, so that's why we've moved up the low end of the range by the net $0.02 effectively, and so that's how we look at it. Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%. And then, our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be -- the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains. So we now expect about $45 million in hedge gains this year versus $40 million that we said in the last quarter. So all that is netting out to have no real operating impact, and so we've reflected the 2 key items, the taxes and the legal accrual."

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many oil industry-dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remained negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means, in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall, in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the country's westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate transfers on their forms to Western union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Right Aide in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention 2 recent announcements that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest Border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage, and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1024255,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet.

Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction were still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Q. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million of gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the Paymap settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook, as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflected our tax rate and the legal matter accrual.

In general, OPEC countries, if you take the OPEC countries, is about 10% to 15% of our revenues. So that puts us in perspective. And some of the -- we still see good growth in U.A.E. We still see good growth in some parts of the businesses, but some parts of the business, I have to be cautious also, because like Saudi Arabia where some investments have been slowed down, some construction, some hotels, some big airports, have been slowed down and that impacted definitely the workforce there respective of the remittance market.

So depending on where -- what you assume for the actual tax rate, you'll have to walk down from that, but I would say, your estimate is a little bit high. And then we have a $0.02 offset to that from the legal accruals, so that's why we've moved up the low end of the range by the net $0.02 effectively, and so that's how we look at it. Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%. And then, our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be -- the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains. So we now expect about $45 million in hedge gains this year versus $40 million that we said in the last quarter.

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business.

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many oil industry-dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remained negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means, in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall, in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the country's westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate transfers on their forms to Western union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Right Aide in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention 2 recent announcements that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest Border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage, and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1024260,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period.

Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction were still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Q. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million of gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the Paymap settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook, as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflected our tax rate and the legal matter accrual.

We are pleased with our European -- U.K. business. Just to put in perspectives, also including Western Union Business Solutions and the C2C business, consumer business, our revenues is about 7% of our company total revenue.

Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%. And then, our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be -- the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains.

And as you know, our digital business plays out mostly in the retail locations today, right, but the growth opportunity for us is also paying -- doing account-to-account or online to account. And we think we're going to create a better and stronger business there than anybody else we'll be able to create."

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many oil industry-dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remained negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means, in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall, in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the country's westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate transfers on their forms to Western union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Right Aide in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention 2 recent announcements that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest Border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage, and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1024562,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period.

Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction were still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Q. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million of gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the Paymap settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook, as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflected our tax rate and the legal matter accrual.

Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%.

We are still seeing the Argentina impact as I mentioned. Secondly, we did grow over the domestic money transfer pricings that we did last year in April, so we're getting a benefit from that. And then third, we did raise some spreads in certain parts of the world. I would say on the spread changes, we have 16,000 quarters that were monitoring pricing activity and pricing levels and we try to optimize those on an ongoing basis. So I wouldn't characterize these as things that stay forever. We may increase spreads, we may reduce spreads. It really depends on what those particular markets require. So that's really the way I would look at the spread changes."

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many oil industry-dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remained negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means, in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall, in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the country's westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate transfers on their forms to Western union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Right Aide in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention 2 recent announcements that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest Border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage, and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1024564,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period.

Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction were still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Q. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million of gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the Paymap settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduction and compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook, as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflected our tax rate and the legal matter accrual. 
Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

You have cost savings as well, but commissions and compliance costs have been relatively stable. That should be -- that's stable for this year, and we've been able to stabilize those last couple of years, so that's positive. But we don't really have an outlook for next year, if that's what you're getting at, Ashwin, but we feel good about the outlook for this year."

So I think that our agent commissions has been favorable for Western Union over the years, as you know. And definitely, the new agreements we signed has not been signing at the rates we signed years ago. Obviously, that helped also. However, I would like to keep and grow my agent network because one of the biggest things we see is that the new customers, which we sign with mobile want to drop money on our retail money transfer, retail locations worldwide, right? We do have, for instance, in India, more than 100,000 locations and you can send money immediately from them -- from your mobile phone immediately to 100,000 locations in India, plus the thousands of millions of millions of accounts in India in a moment. And nobody else can do that, that big, as we can do it, That's a big competitive advantage. Seeing that also, we're always looking for optimization for our sales cost, for our retail costs, and I think that team is working very hard on that. And I think long term, there's definitely some room there to be more efficient."

I would say, the $0.06 that you're calculating is a little bit high. If you -- our new outlook for the tax rate is around 12%, and we had given a mid-teens level. So depending on where -- what you assume for the actual tax rate, you'll have to walk down from that, but I would say, your estimate is a little bit high. And then we have a $0.02 offset to that from the legal accruals, so that's why we've moved up the low end of the range by the net $0.02 effectively, and so that's how we look at it. Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%. And then, our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be -- the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains. So we now expect about $45 million in hedge gains this year versus $40 million that we said in the last quarter. So all that is netting out to have no real operating impact, and so we've reflected the 2 key items, the taxes and the legal accrual."

I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment. Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S. 
The international picture was more mixed with growth in some key European countries, but continued challenges from many oil industry-dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results. 
Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remained negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means, in total, we returned $475 million in the first half of the year. 
Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years. Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries as well as the resilience of our consumer base. While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world. 
As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both Business Solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year. In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our business solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision. Overall, in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we, like others, must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near term, we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives. We continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the country's westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in 8 markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate the transfers on their phones to Western Union locations around the world.
As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries. 
On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements, including a renewal with Rite Aid in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de Mexico. And investing in Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network. 
Finally, I would like to mention the recent announcement that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest Border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage, and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and the long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company. 
So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
909408,373708602,1048700,"The Western Union Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet.

Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million compared to the prior year period. 
In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com with regional growth led by North America and Latin America. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. 
While the previously implemented Argentina price reduction were still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America. 
In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%. 
We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3%, or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. 
Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth but this was offset by continued declines in Russia. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3%, or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.
Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina. 
Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S.-originated online transactions growing 27%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong growth from Europe. 
Turning to margins and profitability, we did incur $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and antifraud programs as noted in our 10-Q. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time. 
Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year or 20.7%, excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. 
The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin, including incremental technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions in compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million compared to $20 million of gains in the second part of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to prior year. 
Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter compares to 22.7% in the prior year period or 25.2%, excluding the Paymap settlement. 
Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual, which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all these items and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter compared to $0.36 in the prior year or $0.41, excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. 
The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5% compared to 23.3% in the prior year and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual. Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reductions in compensation-related costs and other expenses. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 18.3%, excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period. The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. 
Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%. The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation-related expenses. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. 
During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of June was 488 million shares. 
Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase. The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits, with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook. 
Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook, as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items. We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook, although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%.  As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70. 
So to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflect the lower tax rate and the legal matter accrual.

We still see good growth in some parts of the businesses, but some parts of the business, I have to be cautious also, because like Saudi Arabia where some investments have been slowed down, some construction, some hotels, some big airports, have been slowed down and that impacted definitely the workforce there respective to the remittance market.

So depending on where -- what you assume for the actual tax rate, you'll have to walk down from that, but I would say, your estimate is a little bit high. And then we have a $0.02 offset to that from the legal accruals, so that's why we've moved up the low end of the range by the net $0.02 effectively, and so that's how we look at it. Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low- to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%. And then, our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be -- the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains. So we now expect about $45 million in hedge gains this year versus $40 million that we said in the last quarter.

We do have intercompany working capital programs that allow us to free up more cash here in the U.S. And I would also say that over time, we also will have more capacity from a debt standpoint. So there's plenty of availability of capital and the way we manage our cash overall. So I have no concerns there."

Overall, we're pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enables us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this, while mitigating currency headwinds and challenges in some international markets. Our U.S. business remains strong. And westernunion.com money transfer accelerated nicely, increasing 28% in constant currency. This growth help us balance all related softness in many of the Middle East and African countries. We delivered good margins coming in at over 20% despite negative impact from currency and the legal matter accrual and we continue to generate strong cash flow and return significant funds to our shareholders. We are on track to deliver on our full year earnings outlook and are affirming our earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.70. Total revenue in the quarter increased 2% on a constant-currency basis with the consumer money transfer business increasing 1%. Within money transfer, the U.S. business was strong across the Board with good growth from both and domestic money transfer. Our U.S. to Mexico business continues to shine and has now outpaced market growth for principal and transactions in each quarter for the past 3 years. In addition, we recently greatly expanded distribution in Mexico, nearly doubling our network. This was driven by the activation of our transfers, services at OXO, which is Mexico's largest convenience store geographically with 14,000 locations. With this new service, customers can make transactions on the form in advance or through dedicated Forms and digital kiosk in the stores, and then receive their funds at the counter. Turning to westernunion.com, this quarter's revenue increase is impressive, given the larger size of our digital business relative to competitors. We continue to see tremendous growth from the up and the westernunion.com business was particularly strong in the U.S. market. We also continued to expand our digital assets, rolling out mobile apps in Canada and additional countries in Europe, giving a 16 transactional mobile apps in the market among our 37 westernunion.com countries. In addition, in the U.S. and U.K., we have added new omni channel feature to our mobile apps. The customers can now fund same transactions from mobile apps via cards, accounts and also cash. This new feature allows consumers to start transactions on their smartphones and then pay with cash at agent locations, adding convenient and reduce time for in-store transactions. As I mentioned earlier, from all the in countries had been affected by the low oil price environment. While this is not a new factor, we did see a softening in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key markets in the Gulf that had largely maintain growth trends until the middle of the year. Overall, the C2C pricing and competitive environment remains quite stable, as we had not seen significant changes in the marketplace. While there were some announcement recently concerning price changes for competitive services in limited areas, we don't anticipate this having significant impact on our business. We are very well positioned in the U.S. to Mexico with our 50,000 agent locations in the U.S. and 26,000 in Mexico and a very competitive fee of $8 on cents up to $1,000. In the U.S. domestic money transfer market, all the certain competitors are lowering fees on very high principal transfers, this is a small piece of our business to date. To put this in perspective, U.S. domestic money transfers over $1,000 represent less than 1% of company revenue. So overall, we are competitive with our current C2C product and pricing strategy, and for the new feature, we do not anticipate major companywide pricing adjustments. Turning to our -- to the other segments. The consumer bill payment business again delivered double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter, while Business Solutions was flat. All the business solutions had good growth from its payment products, especially verticals, such as serving clients in the education sector, reductions in customers hedging activities, negatively impacted results. Strategically, we continue to advance our edge digital platform for importers and exporters. We have enabled thousands of business clients for use of the platform, which recently won payments innovation award in London. Overall, we remain on track to deliver our earnings outlook even with the many challenges we had faced this year. Our strong financial position has allowed us to continue investing in our platforms including advancements in our digital, technology and compliance assets and programs. And we are intent on further expanding our capabilities and network of digital and physical touch points. These includes agent locations, mobile, online, account and kiosk, both direct and through our agent partners, as we leverage our platforms to offer consumers and businesses freedom of choice in how and when they want to move money across We will talk more about our long-term strategies in the coming months. But right now I want to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results in more detail."
909408,403868862,1068857,"The Western Union Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet. Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 million declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year period.

Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 million declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $52 million compared to the prior year. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while regional growth was led by North America and Latin America. However, softness from the oil-producing countries continue to negatively impact the Middle East and Africa and part of the Asia-Pacific region. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 3% or 2% on a constant-currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 5% or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 3 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact in currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter and was affected by the principal per transaction decline, while pricing had a positive impact of 1%. Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America continue to deliver strong results in the quarter -- in the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on a constant-currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound sends to Mexico and Latin America drove the region's revenue growth. In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico principal and transaction data for the third quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer business also posted good results as revenue increased 4% and transaction growth improved to 5%. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2% or increased 1% on a constant-currency basis, while transactions increased 2%. Revenue growth was driven by Greece and the U.K., partially offset by declines in Turkey. As a reminder, Greece was impacted in the third quarter of last year by government market restrictions on money transfers during the country's financial crisis. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 10% or 8% in constant currency and transactions were down 9%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results in the quarter, which tends weakening since last quarter in Saudi Arabia, Angola and the UAE. In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or 3% constant currency, while transactions decreased 5%. Receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower inventories from the oil-producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 3% and increased 8% constant currency, while transactions grew 12%. Revenue growth in the region was largely driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com C2C revenue growth accelerated to 26% in the quarter or 28% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 29%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%. In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 3% or increased to 11% on a constant-currency basis. Consequence, revenue was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by the declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. The depreciation of the Argentine peso continue to declined in the reported revenues. Business Solutions revenue declined 4%; on a constant-currency basis revenues, were flat. As good growth in Europe was offset by reduced customer hedging activities, particularly in Australia and an Canada. Turning to margins and profitability. The consolidated operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior-year period. This quarter's operating margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from a $15 million accrual related to the previously disclosed SEC legal matter. This is an addition to the $15 million for this in the second quarter as we have not reached resolution with the SEC at this time. Other negative impacts from the margin included foreign exchange, customer and funding mix in the electronic bill payments business and incremental technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. Foreign exchange gains in the quarter were $12 million compared to $21 million of gains in the third quarter of last year. We continue to expect approximately $45 million in hedge gains for the year. Based on recent rates in our current hedge position, we currently project about $15 million of gains for 2017. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $22 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Compliance expense has been steady and came in at 3.5% of revenue in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 25.0%, down from 27.1% in the prior year period as a result of the same negative factors that affected operating margin. The tax rate of 9.6% benefited from a 160 basis points impact from the FTC accrual in compared to 12.5% in the third quarter of last year. We still expect the full year rate of approximately 12%. Earnings per share was $0.44 in the quarter, including a negative $0.02 impact for the additional FTC accrual and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of last year. The C2C segment operating margin of 23.4% was down from 25.5% in the prior year, and was negatively affected by 140 basis points from the accrual. The C2C margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange and higher technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation-related costs. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business. The mix impacts relate to the addition of a large new of lower margins and general increase credit card usage of the funding option by consumers. Business Solutions operating profit was $3 million or a 3.5% margin compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower depreciation and amortization expense, which relates to the write-down for a contract termination in the third quarter of last year. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to a $20 million in the prior year. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 17.1%, which compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of last year. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities were $822 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.2 billion in cash of $1.3 billion with approximately 50% of the cash held by The United States entities. After the quarter, in October, we retired $1 billion in maturing notes, which had a coupon of 5.93%. We're funded this maturity by drawing down on a $575 million term loan facility, which carries interest rate of LIBOR plus 150. And through a combination of cash usage and commercial issuance. During the third quarter, we repaid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $84 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017 was $310 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of September was 485 million shares. Turning to our outlook for the full year. We are narrowing the revenue growth outlook, while affirming operating profit margin, the EPS range and operating cash flow. The updated revenue outlook for the year is an increase of approximately 3% constant currency, which should translate to a decrease of approximately 1% on a GAAP basis. Operating profit margin for the full year, remained approximately 20%, while EPS remains in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. We have been able to maintain the margin outlook despite the unanticipated $30 million of legal matter accruals during the year due to favorability in other expenses. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities and we now expect the $100 million of anticipated final tax payment related to the previously announced IRS agreement we paid in 2017. So to summarize, we delivered solid results for the quarter and remain on track with our full year earnings outlook. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

We also have some favorable resolutions to sustaining tax matters with various governments around the world. And so that continues to help us and we're going to continue to try to do that as much as we can.

Overall, we're pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this, while mitigating currency headwinds and market challenges in some international markets. Our U.S. business remains strong. And westernunion.com money transfer accelerated nicely, increasing 28% in constant currency. This growth help us balance all related softness in many of the Middle East and African countries. 
We delivered good margins, coming in at over 20% despite negative impacts from currency and a legal matter accrual, and we continue to generate strong cash flow and return significant funds to our shareholders. 
We are on track to deliver on our full year earnings outlook and are affirming our earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.70. Total revenue in the quarter increased 2% on a constant-currency basis with the consumer money transfer business increasing 1%. Within money transfer, the U.S. business was strong across-the-board with good growth from both outbound and domestic money transfer. Our U.S. to Mexico business continues to shine and has now outpaced market growth for principal and transactions in each quarter for the past 3 years. In addition, we recently greatly expanded distribution in Mexico, nearly doubling our network. This was driven by the activation of our transfers, services at OXO, which is Mexico's largest convenience store geographically with 14,000 locations. With this new service, customers can stage transactions on the form in advance or through dedicated forms and digital kiosk in the stores, and then receive their funds at the counter. 
Turning to westernunion.com. This quarter's revenue increase is impressive, given the larger size of our digital business relative to competitors. We continue to see tremendous growth from the mobile app and the westernunion.com business was particularly strong in the U.S. market. We also continued to expand our digital assets, rolling out mobile apps in Canada and additional countries in Europe, giving us 16 transactional mobile apps in the market among our 37 westernunion.com countries. In addition, in the U.S. and the U.K., we have added a new omnichannel feature to our mobile apps. The customers can now fund same transactions from mobile apps via cards, accounts and also cash. This new feature allows consumers to start transactions on their smartphones and then pay with cash at agent locations, adding convenience and reduced time for in-store transactions. 
As I mentioned earlier, remittence flows from oil producing countries had been affected by the low oil price environment. While this is not a new factor, we did see softening in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key markets in the Gulf that had largely maintained growth trends until the middle of the year.
Overall, the C2C pricing and competitive environment remains quite stable, as we had not seen significant changes in the marketplace. While there were some announcement recently concerning price changes for competitive services in limited areas, we don't anticipate this having significant impact on our business. 
We are very well positioned in the U.S. to Mexico corridor with our 50,000 agent locations in the U.S. and 26,000 in Mexico and a very competitive fee of $8 on sends up to $1,000.
In the U.S. domestic money transfer market, all the certain competitors are lowering fees on very high principal transfer, this is a small piece of our business to date. To put this in perspective, U.S. domestic money transfers over $1,000 represent less than 1% of company revenue. 
So overall, we are competitive with our current C2C product and pricing strategy, and for the new feature, we do not anticipate major companywide pricing adjustments. 
Turning to our -- to the other segments. The consumer bill payment business again delivered double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter, while Business Solutions was flat. Although Business Solutions had good growth from its payments product, especially verticals such as serving clients in the education sector, reductions in customers hedging activities, negatively impacted results. Strategically, we continue to advance our EDGE digital platform for importers and exporters. We have enabled thousands of business clients for use of the platform, which recently won payments innovation award in London. 
Overall, we remain on track to deliver our earnings outlook even with the many challenges we have faced this year. Our strong financial position has allowed us to continue investing in our platforms including advancements in our digital, technology and compliance assets and programs. And we are intent on further expanding our capabilities and network of digital and physical touch points. These include agent locations, mobile, online, account and kiosk, both direct and through our agent partners, as we leverage our platforms to offer consumers and businesses freedom of choice in how and when they want to move money across border.
We will talk more about our long-term strategies in the coming months. But right now, I want to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results in more detail."
909408,403868862,1069170,"The Western Union Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet.

Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion, declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $52 million compared to the prior year. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while regional growth was led by North America and Latin America. However, softness from the oil-producing countries continue to negatively impact the Middle East and Africa and part of the Asia-Pacific region. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 3% or 2% on a constant-currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 5% or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 3 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact in currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter and was affected by the principal per transaction decline, while pricing had a positive 1 -- impact of 1%. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America continue to deliver strong results in the quarter -- in the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on an constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound sends to Mexico and Latin America drove the region's revenue growth. In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de México principal and transaction data for the third quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer business also posted good results, as revenue increased 4% and transaction growth improved to 5%. 
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 2%. Revenue growth was driven by Greece and the U.K., partially offset by declines in Turkey. As a reminder, Greece was impacted in the third quarter of last year by government imposed market restrictions on money transfers during the country's financial crisis. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 10% or 8% constant currency and transactions were down 9%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results in the quarter, with trends weakening since last quarter in Saudi Arabia, Angola and the UAE. 
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or 3% constant currency, while transactions decreased 5%. Receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 3% and increased 8% constant currency, while transactions grew 12%. Revenue growth in the region was largely driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. 
Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com C2C revenue growth accelerated to 26% in the quarter or 28% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 29%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 3% or increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. The depreciation of the Argentine peso continued to declined in the reported revenues. Business Solutions revenue declined 4%. On a constant-currency basis revenues were flat, as good growth in Europe was offset by reduced customer hedging activities, particularly in Australia and an Canada. 
Turning to margins and profitability. The consolidated operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior-year period. This quarter's operating margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from a $15 million accrual related to the previously disclosed FTC legal matter. This is an addition to the $15 million we accrued for this in the second quarter, as we have not reached an appropriate resolution with the FTC at this time.  Other negative impacts from the margin included foreign exchange, customer and funding mix in the electronic bill payments business and incremental technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $12 million compared to $21 million of gains in the third quarter of last year. We continue to expect approximately $45 million in hedge gains for the year. Based on recent rates and our current hedge position, we currently project about $15 million of gains for 2017. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $22 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. 
Compliance expense has been steady and came in at 3.5% of revenue in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 25.0%, down from 27.1% in the prior year period, as a result of the same negative factors that affected operating margin. 
The tax rate of 9.6% benefited from a 160 basis point impact from the FTC accrual in -- compared to 12.5% in the third quarter of last year. We still expect a full year rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share was $0.44 in the quarter, including a negative $0.02 impact for the additional FTC accrual and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of last year. 
The C2C segment operating margin of 23.4% was down from 25.5% in the prior year, and was negatively affected by 140 basis points from the accrual. The C2C margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange and higher technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation-related costs. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business. The mix impacts relate to the addition of an large new biller [ph] of lower margins and general increases in credit card usage as a funding option by consumers. 
Business Solutions operating profit was $3 million or a 3.5% margin compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower depreciation and amortization expense, which relates to the write-down for a contract termination in the third quarter of last year. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 17.1%, which compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $822 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.3 billion, with approximately 50% of the cash held by United States entities. 
After the quarter, in October, we retired $1 billion in maturing notes, which had a coupon of 5.93%. We're funded this maturity by drawing down on a $575 million term loan facility, which carries interest rates of LIBOR plus 150. And through a combination of cash usage and commercial paper issuance. During the third quarter, we repaid -- paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $84 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $310 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of September was 485 million shares. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We are narrowing the revenue growth outlook, while affirming operating profit margin, the EPS range and operating cash flow. The updated revenue outlook for the year is an increase of approximately 3% constant currency, which should translate to a decrease of approximately 1% on a GAAP basis. Operating profit margin for the full year, remains approximately 20%, while EPS remains in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. We have been able to maintain the margin outlook despite the unanticipated $30 million of legal matter accruals during the year, due to favorability and other expenses. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, and we now expect the $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously announced IRS agreements be paid in 2017. 
So to summarize, we delivered solid results for the quarter and remain on track with our full year earnings outlook. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders.

We also have had some favorable resolutions to various outstanding tax matters with various governments around the world.

Overall, we're pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this, while mitigating currency headwinds and market challenges in some international markets. Our U.S. business remains strong. And westernunion.com money transfer accelerated nicely, increasing 28% in constant currency. This growth helps us balance all related softness in many of the Middle East and African countries. 
We delivered good margins, coming in at over 20% despite negative impacts from currency and a legal matter accrual, and we continue to generate strong cash flow and return significant funds to our shareholders. 
We are on track to deliver on our full year earnings outlook and are affirming our earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.70. Total revenue in the quarter increased 2% on a constant-currency basis with the consumer money transfer business increasing 1%. Within money transfer, the U.S. business was strong across-the-board with good growth from both outbound and domestic money transfer. Our U.S. to Mexico business continues to shine and has now outpaced market growth for principal and transactions in each quarter for the past 3 years. In addition, we recently greatly expanded distribution in Mexico, nearly doubling our network. This was driven by the activation of our transfers, services at OXO, which is Mexico's largest convenience store geographically with 14,000 locations. With this new service, customers can stage transactions on the form in advance or through dedicated forms and digital kiosk in the stores, and then receive their funds at the counter. 
Turning to westernunion.com. This quarter's revenue increase is impressive, given the larger size of our digital business relative to competitors. We continue to see tremendous growth from the mobile app and the westernunion.com business was particularly strong in the U.S. market. We also continued to expand our digital assets, rolling out mobile apps in Canada and additional countries in Europe, giving us 16 transactional mobile apps in the market among our 37 westernunion.com countries. In addition, in the U.S. and the U.K., we have added a new omnichannel feature to our mobile apps. The customers can now fund same transactions from mobile apps via cards, accounts and also cash. This new feature allows consumers to start transactions on their smartphones and then pay with cash at agent locations, adding convenience and reduced time for in-store transactions. 
As I mentioned earlier, remittence flows from oil producing countries had been affected by the low oil price environment. While this is not a new factor, we did see softening in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key markets in the Gulf that had largely maintained growth trends until the middle of the year.
Overall, the C2C pricing and competitive environment remains quite stable, as we had not seen significant changes in the marketplace. While there were some announcements recently concerning price changes for competitive services in limited areas, we don't anticipate this having significant impact on our business. 
We are very well positioned in the U.S. to Mexico corridor with our 50,000 agent locations in the U.S. and 26,000 in Mexico and a very competitive fee of $8 on sends up to $1,000.
In the U.S. domestic money transfer market, all the certain competitors are lowering fees on very high principal transfer. This is a small piece of our business to date. To put this in perspective, U.S. domestic money transfers over $1,000 represent less than 1% of company revenue. 
So overall, we are competitive with our current C2C product and pricing strategy, and for the new feature, we do not anticipate major companywide pricing adjustments. 
Turning to our -- to the other segments. The consumer bill payment business again delivered double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter, while Business Solutions was flat. Although Business Solutions had good growth from its payments product, especially verticals such as serving clients in the education sector, reductions in customers hedging activities, negatively impacted results. Strategically, we continue to advance our EDGE digital platform for importers and exporters. We have enabled thousands of business clients for use of the platform, which recently won payments innovation award in London. 
Overall, we remain on track to deliver our earnings outlook even with the many challenges we have faced this year. Our strong financial position has allowed us to continue investing in our platforms including advancements in our digital, technology and compliance assets and programs. And we are intent on further expanding our capabilities and network of digital and physical touch points. These include agent locations, mobile, online, account and kiosk, both direct and through our agent partners, as we leverage our platforms to offer consumers and businesses freedom of choice in how and when they want to move money across borders.
We will talk more about our long-term strategies in the coming months. But right now, I want to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results in more detail."
909408,403868862,1069278,"The Western Union Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet.

Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion, declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $52 million compared to the prior year. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while regional growth was led by North America and Latin America. However, softness from the oil-producing countries continues to negatively impact the Middle East and Africa and part of the Asia-Pacific region. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 3% or 2% on a constant-currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 5% or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 3 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact in currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter and was affected by the principal per transaction decline, while pricing had a positive 1 -- impact of 1%. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America continues to deliver strong results in the quarter -- in the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on an constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound sends to Mexico and Latin America drove the region's revenue growth. In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de México principal and transaction data for the third quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer business also posted good results, as revenue increased 4% and transaction growth improved to 5%. 
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 2%. Revenue growth was driven by Greece and the U.K., partially offset by declines in Turkey. As a reminder, Greece was impacted in the third quarter of last year by government imposed market restrictions on money transfers during the country's financial crisis. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 10% or 8% constant currency and transactions were down 9%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results in the quarter, with trends weakening since last quarter in Saudi Arabia, Angola and the UAE. 
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or 3% constant currency, while transactions decreased 5%. Receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 3% and increased 8% constant currency, while transactions grew 12%. Revenue growth in the region was largely driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. 
Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com C2C revenue growth accelerated to 26% in the quarter or 28% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 29%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 3% or increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. The depreciation of the Argentine peso continued to cause the decline in the reported revenues. Business Solutions revenue declined 4%. On a constant-currency basis revenues were flat, as good growth in Europe was offset by reduced customer hedging activities, particularly in Australia and Canada. 
Turning to margins and profitability. The consolidated operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior-year period. This quarter's operating margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from a $15 million accrual related to the previously disclosed FTC legal matter. This is an addition to the $15 million we accrued for this in the second quarter, as we have not reached an appropriate resolution with the FTC at this time.  Other negative impacts from the margin included foreign exchange, customer and funding mix in the electronic bill payments business and incremental technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $12 million compared to $21 million of gains in the third quarter of last year. We continue to expect approximately $45 million in hedge gains for the year. Based on recent rates and our current hedge position, we currently project about $15 million of gains for 2017. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $22 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. 
Compliance expense has been steady and came in at 3.5% of revenue in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 25.0%, down from 27.1% in the prior year period, as a result of the same negative factors that affected operating margin. 
The tax rate of 9.6% benefited from a 160 basis point impact from the FTC accrual in -- compared to 12.5% in the third quarter of last year. We still expect a full year rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share was $0.44 in the quarter, including a negative $0.02 impact for the additional FTC accrual and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of last year. 
The C2C segment operating margin of 23.4% was down from 25.5% in the prior year period, and was negatively affected by 140 basis points from the accrual. The C2C margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange and higher technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation-related costs. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronics business. The mix impacts relate to the addition of an large new biller of lower margins and general increases in credit card usage as a funding option by consumers. 
Business Solutions operating profit was $3 million or a 3.5% margin compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower depreciation and amortization expense, which relates to the write-down for a contract termination in the third quarter of last year. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 17.1%, which compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $822 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.3 billion, with approximately 50% of the cash held by United States entities. 
After the quarter, in October, we retired $1 billion in maturing notes, which had a coupon of 5.93%. We've funded this maturity by drawing down on a $575 million term loan facility, which carries interest rates of LIBOR plus 150. And through a combination of cash usage and commercial paper issuance. During the third quarter, we repaid -- paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $84 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $310 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of September was 485 million shares. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We are narrowing the revenue growth outlook, while affirming operating profit margin, the EPS range and operating cash flow. The updated revenue outlook for the year is an increase of approximately 3% constant currency, which should translate to a decrease of approximately 1% on a GAAP basis. Operating profit margin for the full year, remains approximately 20%, while EPS remains in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. We have been able to maintain the margin outlook despite the unanticipated $30 million of legal matter accruals during the year, due to favorability and other expenses. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, and we now expect the $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously announced IRS agreements be paid in 2017. 
So to summarize, we delivered solid results for the quarter and remain on track with our full year earnings outlook. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders. 
Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

And we still had 6 months left in the year when we maintained our outlook last quarter, low- to-mid-digits. But as we've seen a tick down in the business given the oil-related markets, we're more comfortable with the 3% revenue growth outlook because of the performance that we had in the third quarter. And it's really the Middle East and the oil-related markets that have shown a tick down, because we're continuing to get very strong growth in the other markets like the U.S., Alpine to Mexico to Latin America, the domestic business, the digital business obviously. And so those trends haven't really changed. We've seen just a tick down in the Middle East and Africa business, which is impacting APAC, as well."

We -- as we mentioned before, we do pricing optimization throughout our business including our various channels, and we did increase some spreads in the  .com business. But our overall pricing in the .com business is very market competitive when you look at the rest of the competition. So we're just really aligning and maximizing the opportunity there. And we're getting very consistent growth with transaction growth, 29% transaction growth and 28% constant revenue growth. So it's a pretty consistent picture and it's very consistent with what we had expected coming into the second half of this year."

But as I also mentioned, we're always trying to look for opportunities to optimize our tax rate. We will have some interest savings as we go into next year because of the refinancing that we just did. Ultimate amount of interest rates will depend on our debt level and then we also have a refinancing to make sure that we have to do, so there be some negative carry related to that.

Overall, we're pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this, while mitigating",832,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we're pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this, while mitigating currency headwinds and market challenges in some international markets. Our U.S. business remains strong. And westernunion.com money transfer accelerated nicely, increasing 28% in constant currency. This growth helps us balance all related softness in many of the Middle East and African countries. 
We delivered good margins, coming in at over 20% despite negative impacts from currency and a legal matter accrual, and we continue to generate strong cash flow and return significant funds to our shareholders. 
We are on track to deliver on our full year earnings outlook and are affirming our earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.70. Total revenue in the quarter increased 2% on a constant-currency basis with the consumer money transfer business increasing 1%. Within money transfer, the U.S. business was strong across-the-board with good growth from both outbound and domestic money transfer. Our U.S. to Mexico business continues to shine and has now outpaced market growth for principal and transactions in each quarter for the past 3 years. In addition, we recently greatly expanded distribution in Mexico, nearly doubling our network. This was driven by the activation of our transfers, services at OXO, which is Mexico's largest convenience store geographically with 14,000 locations. With this new service, customers can stage transactions on the form in advance or through dedicated forms and digital kiosk in the stores, and then receive their funds at the counter. 
Turning to westernunion.com. This quarter's revenue increase is impressive, given the larger size of our digital business relative to competitors. We continue to see tremendous growth from the mobile app and the westernunion.com business was particularly strong in the U.S. market. We also continued to expand our digital assets, rolling out mobile apps in Canada and additional countries in Europe, giving us 16 transactional mobile apps in the market among our 37 westernunion.com countries. In addition, in the U.S. and the U.K., we have added a new omnichannel feature to our mobile apps. The customers can now fund same transactions from mobile apps via cards, accounts and also cash. This new feature allows consumers to start transactions on their smartphones and then pay with cash at agent locations, adding convenience and reduced time for in-store transactions. 
As I mentioned earlier, remittance flows from oil producing countries had been affected by the low oil price environment. While this is not a new factor, we did see softening in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key markets in the Gulf that had largely maintained growth trends until the middle of the year.
Overall, the C2C pricing and competitive environment remains quite stable, as we had not seen significant changes in the marketplace. While there were some announcements recently concerning price changes for competitive services in limited areas, we don't anticipate this having significant impact on our business. 
We are very well positioned in the U.S. to Mexico corridor with our 50,000 agent locations in the U.S. and 26,000 in Mexico and a very competitive fee of $8 on sends up to $1,000.
In the U.S. domestic money transfer market, all the certain competitors are lowering fees on very high principal transfer. This is a small piece of our business to date. To put this in perspective, U.S. domestic money transfers over $1,000 represent less than 1% of company revenue. 
So overall, we are competitive with our current C2C product and pricing strategy, and for the new feature, we do not anticipate major companywide pricing adjustments. 
Turning to our -- to the other segments. The consumer bill payment business again delivered double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter, while Business Solutions was flat. Although Business Solutions had good growth from its payments product, especially verticals such as serving clients in the education sector, reductions in customers hedging activities, negatively impacted results. Strategically, we continue to advance our EDGE digital platform for importers and exporters. We have enabled thousands of business clients for use of the platform, which recently won payments innovation award in London. 
Overall, we remain on track to deliver our earnings outlook even with the many challenges we have faced this year. Our strong financial position has allowed us to continue investing in our platforms including advancements in our digital, technology and compliance assets and programs. And we are intent on further expanding our capabilities and network of digital and physical touch points.

909408,403868862,1070560,"The Western Union Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Western Union Company","Executives","Thank you, Hikmet.

Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion, declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $52 million compared to the prior year. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while regional growth was led by North America and Latin America. However, softness from the oil-producing countries continues to negatively impact the Middle East and Africa and part of the Asia-Pacific region. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 3% or 2% on a constant-currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 5% or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 3 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact in currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter and was affected by the principal per transaction decline, while pricing had a positive 1 -- impact of 1%. 
Turning to the regions. Consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America continues to deliver strong results in the quarter -- in the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on an constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound sends to Mexico and Latin America drove the region's revenue growth. In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de México principal and transaction data for the third quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer business also posted good results, as revenue increased 4% and transaction growth improved to 5%. 
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 2%. Revenue growth was driven by Greece and the U.K., partially offset by declines in Turkey. As a reminder, Greece was impacted in the third quarter of last year by government imposed market restrictions on money transfers during the country's financial crisis. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 10% or 8% constant currency and transactions were down 9%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results in the quarter, with trends weakening since last quarter in Saudi Arabia, Angola and the UAE. 
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or 3% constant currency, while transactions decreased 5%. Receive markets in the region, including India, continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 3% and increased 8% constant currency, while transactions grew 12%. Revenue growth in the region was largely driven by strong inbound business from the U.S. 
Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com C2C revenue growth accelerated to 26% in the quarter or 28% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 29%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%. 
In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 3% or increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. The depreciation of the Argentine peso continued to cause the decline in the reported revenues. Business Solutions revenue declined 4%. On a constant-currency basis revenues were flat, as good growth in Europe was offset by reduced customer hedging activities, particularly in Australia and Canada. 
Turning to margins and profitability. The consolidated operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior-year period. This quarter's operating margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from a $15 million accrual related to the previously disclosed FTC legal matter. This is an addition to the $15 million we accrued for this in the second quarter, as we have not reached an appropriate resolution with the FTC at this time.  Other negative impacts from the margin included foreign exchange, customer and funding mix in the electronic bill payments business and incremental technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $12 million compared to $21 million of gains in the third quarter of last year. We continue to expect approximately $45 million in hedge gains for the year. Based on recent rates and our current hedge position, we currently project about $15 million of gains for 2017. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $22 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. 
Compliance expense has been steady and came in at 3.5% of revenue in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 25.0%, down from 27.1% in the prior year period, as a result of the same negative factors that affected operating margin. 
The tax rate of 9.6% benefited from a 160 basis point impact from the FTC accrual in -- compared to 12.5% in the third quarter of last year. We still expect a full year rate of approximately 12%. 
Earnings per share was $0.44 in the quarter, including a negative $0.02 impact for the additional FTC accrual and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of last year. 
The C2C segment operating margin of 23.4% was down from 25.5% in the prior year period, and was negatively affected by 140 basis points from the accrual. The C2C margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange and higher technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation-related costs. 
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronics business. The mix impacts relate to the addition of an large new biller of lower margins and general increases in credit card usage as a funding option by consumers. 
Business Solutions operating profit was $3 million or a 3.5% margin compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower depreciation and amortization expense, which relates to the write-down for a contract termination in the third quarter of last year. 
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 17.1%, which compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $822 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.3 billion, with approximately 50% of the cash held by United States entities. 
After the quarter, in October, we retired $1 billion in maturing notes, which had a coupon of 5.93%. We've funded this maturity by drawing down on a $575 million term loan facility, which carries interest rates of LIBOR plus 150. And through a combination of cash usage and commercial paper issuance. During the third quarter, we repaid -- paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $84 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $310 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of September was 485 million shares. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We are narrowing the revenue growth outlook, while affirming operating profit margin, the EPS range and operating cash flow. The updated revenue outlook for the year is an increase of approximately 3% constant currency, which should translate to a decrease of approximately 1% on a GAAP basis. Operating profit margin for the full year, remains approximately 20%, while EPS remains in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. We have been able to maintain the margin outlook despite the unanticipated $30 million of legal matter accruals during the year, due to favorability and other expenses. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, and we now expect the $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously announced IRS agreements be paid in 2017. 
So to summarize, we delivered solid results for the quarter and remain on track with our full year earnings outlook. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders. 
Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

We've continued to benefit from some discreet items that have helped us during the course of the year. In this quarter, for example, we obviously, we got a benefit from the larger accrual in the U.S., which helps to -- helps the mix on the overall tax rate. We also have had some favorable resolutions to various outstanding tax matters with various governments around the world. And so that continues to help us, and we're going to continue to try to do that as much as we can. Putting aside the discreet items, we're probably in that mid-teens rate, which is what we fully expected when we came into this year. But we're doing a good job in trying to manage things as best as we can on the tax side and that continues to be our goal."
