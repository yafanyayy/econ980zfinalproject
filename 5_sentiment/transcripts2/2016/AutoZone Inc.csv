With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. 
Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 30 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow with sales increasing 8%, and we opened 32 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores. 
And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 9 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 2 new item branches, bringing our total branch count to 24. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth prospects in domestic locations, commercial, international and our other businesses. 
If I could sum up the quarter in a short statement, I would call out our major highlights, and I'd say we've continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while adding more labor hours in our stores in an effort to constantly improve our customers' experiences. 
While winter temperatures were milder this year than last, we did not see a material change in business trends from 1 month to the next overall. Yes, certain cold weather categories, those that have larger sales during these months, were below last year's numbers while others balanced out our performance. And yes, as you would expect, our performance in the Midwest and Northeast were below other markets but they were in line with our expectations considering the weather patterns. 
Probably the biggest unknown for us this quarter was when would income tax refund begin to be remitted to consumers by the IRS. By quarter end, total refunds were generally comparable to remittances last year, but they were issued very, very late in our quarter. 
We feel our Retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall fuel prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more. 
Regarding commercial, we saw colder weather markets growing sales at a slower pace than other markets. We believe the milder temperatures led to less failure-related repairs being done in those particular markets. However, we believe the mild temperatures will not have a material lasting effect on our sales performance heading into the summer. We feel a hot summer is the next thing we'll be watching for in regards to sales performance. 
Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority, the business did quite well in the second quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis, and performance was generally consistent across the country. While the macroeconomy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we also continued to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store label -- labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. 
Regarding commercial, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry. Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued to roll out more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of 1,300 locations out of our 5,000-plus locations on multiple weekly deliveries. 
As we've been discussing, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either 3x or 5x a week. Our results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 700 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service model. 
The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 20 to 30 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. 
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was less than the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business, and our teams are executing it well and managing the cost effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense. 
Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the MegaHub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 MegaHubs with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to open -- to add approximately 5 additional MegaHubs over the last 2 quarters of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. 
Our sales results thus far in our open MegaHubs continue to exceed our expectations. And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. 
Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently, 5 MegaHubs support approximately 700 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,000 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. 
Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
As I mentioned a few years ago -- a few minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, ""Yes! We've Got It."" more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We have made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. 
As traffic has increased in our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes! We've Got It."" While still in the -- still early in the implementation training phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. 
We also want to touch on the efforts that are ongoing with regard to capturing data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. While still in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective on our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. 
This will be a significant endeavor for us over the next couple of years. We have spent a lot of time mapping through the capture of this data in order to leverage it to better serve our customers. We think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later on this initiative.
Lastly, in order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as MegaHubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18.
To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from past, we do expect to incur approximately 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin headwind from these investments alone.
Now turning to the second quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.3% on top of 7.7% growth in Q2 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Our growth in both sales and earnings were very consistent with our results from Q1. This quarter's sales results were also very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, tax refunds in total were generally comparable to prior year. However, from a timing perspective, they flowed very late in the quarter. In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, failure-related product sales performed the best. Discretionary had the next highest growth rate, followed by maintenance. While all 3 showed nice growth, we attribute the variance in sales trends between these businesses to the timing of winter events, for example, the polar vortex effects this year versus last. 
As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, we opened 32 net new programs and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. Our total domestic sales grew 6% on the quarter. Our domestic commercial sales growth was up 8%. The total -- the commercial sales growth rate, while still impressive, has slowed. Some of the reduction in growth is due to opening fewer new programs in recent years and having a lower percentage of the programs on the maturation curve. 
Despite this expected change, our sales slowed a bit more than we expected, and we are working diligently to gain back that momentum. In recent weeks, we've executed incremental trading and enhanced the focus of our management teams, including store managers, on reaccelerating our commercial growth. We believe our future in this business remains quite bright.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 1 additional hub location and now operate 179. In addition to opening, over time, more MegaHub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hub stores.
Regarding IMC, we opened 2 new branches this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone locations today, and we believe there are great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers. 
Regarding Mexico, we opened another 9 stores this quarter and now have 451 total locations in Mexico. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done quite well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate starting this summer in the June to July time frame as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases.
For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than 2 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, the peso was down 29% versus last year and 16% from the end of Q1. 
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which include autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Each of these businesses operate in increasingly competitive environments and our sales have slowed a bit. 
Again, while we understand weather this winter was warmer, we are optimistic for sales this upcoming quarter. The biggest tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, is the increased miles driven across the country. This leads to more failure- and maintenance-related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses. 
While we are -- while we focus on both the short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 38 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is an important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our MegaHubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of fiscal 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably growing our commercial business; leveraging the Internet; improving inventory availability; and ""Yes! We've Got It.""
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech- and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. 
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly, share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. 
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31%. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of Hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. 
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank again our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, Total Auto Parts sales, which includes our dome",1506,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. 
For the quarter, Total Auto Parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 24 IMC branches, increased 5.4%. 
Switching over to macro trends. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.09 a gallon and ended the quarter at $1.72 a gallon, a $0.37 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.55 per gallon during the second quarter, starting at $2.82 and ending at $2.27 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. 
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both October, November and December, and we don't have January data yet. For all of 2015, miles driven finished up 3.5%, an incredibly strong number on a historical basis. It represents the largest percentage growth in over a decade. 
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store was $1,780,000. 
For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 8%. In the second quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $30 million over last year's Q2. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q2, some of this is due to slower growth from our lower mix of new programs. We've intensified the focus of our entire team, including our store managers on reaccelerating our growth in commercial, and we have recently executed some incremental commercial training programs. 
This past quarter, we opened 32 net new programs versus 29 programs opened in our second quarter last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,228 stores supported by 179 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, 26% of the base. 
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs, and that will continue to be the case, albeit at a slightly moderated pace. 
This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 150 more programs over the next 2 quarters. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. 
In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner, and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.
Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 9 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 451 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second distribution center in the country, and it will support further central Mexico store growth.
As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth by over 2 percentage points. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, Mexico leadership continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. As the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters.
Regarding Brazil, we opened no stores in the quarter, remaining with 8 stores opened. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 29% year-over-year, the real devalued 41% this year versus last. 
This extraordinary volatility is managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil but have been encouraged by improving operating performance. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2,257,000,000, an increase of 5.3% over last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 3.6% for the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 50 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. 
In regards to inflation, it remains subdued, in fact, in total, slightly to -- slightly down last year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, higher by 40 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable credit card litigation settlement recognized last year's quarter and higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. 
EBIT for the quarter was $383 million, up 6% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 17%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared with $35 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,845,000,000 or approximately $415 million more than last year's balance of $4,430,000,000.
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was slightly lower than last year's Q2 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned. And any deviations to our plan are driven primarily by the resolution of discrete tax items as they arise.
Net income for the quarter was $229 million and up 8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.8 million was down 5.4% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.43, up 14.2% over the prior year's second quarter.
Relating to the cash flow statement. For the second fiscal quarter, we generated $207 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled approximately $100 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,193 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 451 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,652. We also had 24 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,676.
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $60 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $150 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $548 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter end. 
Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to do our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 109%.
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $633,000 versus $631,000 last year and $624,000 last quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. 
Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our MegaHubs has been strong and ahead of our expectations, and we look forward to opening more later this year. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. 
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success.
Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content.

Some of that we would attribute to some weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast but not all of it.

There was a massive amount of refunds that were processed the Wednesday before our quarter ended. We obviously had a very nice weekend. Did we get all the benefit that we normally get in the quarter? Probably not, but it's really hard to say.

We didn't quantify it at this time so it was clearly our [indiscernible] clearly less than that, but there's probably a bit of it that's going to flow into the third quarter."

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. 
Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 30 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 8%, and we opened 32 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 9 stores this quarter. 
We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 2 new IMC branches, bringing our total branch count to 24. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth prospects in domestic locations, commercial, international and our other businesses. 
If I could sum up the quarter in a short statement, I would call out our major highlights, and I'd say we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while adding more labor hours in our stores in an effort to constantly improve our customers' experiences. 
While winter temperatures were milder this year than last, we did not see a material change in business trends from one month to the next, overall. Yes, certain cold weather categories, those that have larger sales during these months, were below last year's numbers while others balanced out our performance. And yes, as you would expect, our performance in the Midwest and Northeast were below other markets, but they were in line with our expectations considering the weather patterns. 
Probably the biggest unknown for us this quarter was when would income tax refund begin to be remitted to consumers by the IRS. By quarter-end, total refunds were generally comparable to remittances last year, but they were issued very, very late in our quarter. 
We feel our Retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall fuel prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more. 
Regarding commercial, we saw colder weather markets growing sales at a slower pace than other markets. We believe the milder temperatures led to less failure-related repairs being done in those particular markets. However, we believe the mild temperatures will not have a material lasting effect on our sales performance heading into the summer. We feel a hot summer is the next thing we'll be watching for in regards to sales performance.
Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority, the business did quite well in the second quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis, and performance was generally consistent across the country. While the macroeconomy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we also continued to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store label -- labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We're committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. 
Regarding Commercial, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry. Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued to roll out at more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of 1,300 locations out of our 5,000-plus locations on multiple weekly deliveries.
As we've been discussing, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either 3 or 5x a week. Our results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 700 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service model. 
The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 20 to 30 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. 
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was less than the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business, and our teams are executing it well and managing the cost effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense. 
Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 mega hubs, with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to open -- to add approximately 5 additional mega hubs over the last 2 quarters of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. 
Our sales results thus far in our opened mega hubs continued to exceed our expectations. And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. 
Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently, 5 mega hubs support approximately 700 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,000 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. 
Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
As I mentioned a few years ago -- 15 minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, ""Yes! We've Got It."" more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. 
As traffic has increased in our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes! We've Got It."" While still in the -- still early in the implementation training phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically, the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. 
We also want to touch on the efforts that are ongoing with regard to capturing data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. While still in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective on our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. 
This will be a significant endeavor for us over the next couple of years. We have spent a lot of time mapping through the capture of this data in order to leverage it to better serve our customers. We think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later on this initiative.
Lastly, in order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as mega hubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18.
To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from past, we do expect to incur approximately 20 to 30 basis points gross margin headwind from these investments alone.
Now turning to the second quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.3% on top of 7.7% growth in Q2 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Our growth in both sales and earnings were very consistent with our results from Q1. This quarter's sales results were also very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, tax refunds, in total, were generally comparable to prior year. However, from a timing perspective, they flowed very late in the quarter. In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, failure-related product sales performed the best. Discretionary had the next highest growth rate, followed by maintenance. While all 3 showed nice growth, we attribute the variance of sales trends between these businesses to the timing of winter events, for example, the polar vortex effects this year versus last. 
As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, we opened 32 net new programs and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. Our total domestic sales grew 6% on the quarter. Our domestic commercial sales growth was up 8%. The total -- the commercial sales growth rate, while still impressive, has slowed. Some of the reduction in growth is due to opening fewer new programs in recent years and having a lower percentage of the programs on the maturation curve.
Despite this expected change, our sales slowed a bit more than we expected and we are working diligently to gain back that momentum. In recent weeks, we've executed incremental trading and enhanced the focus of our management teams, including store managers, on reaccelerating our commercial growth. We believe our future in this business remains quite bright.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened one additional hub location and now operate 179. In addition to opening, over time, more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hub stores.
Regarding IMC, we opened 2 new branches this quarter and continued to be excited by our opportunities. IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone locations today, and we believe there are great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers. 
Regarding Mexico, we opened another 9 stores this quarter and now have 451 total locations in Mexico. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done quite well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate starting this summer in the June to July time frame as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases.
For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than 2 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, the peso was down 29% versus last year and 16% from the end of Q1. 
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 3% over the last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which include autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Each of these businesses operate in increasingly competitive environments, and our sales have slowed a bit. 
Again, while we understand weather this winter was warmer, we are optimistic for sales this upcoming quarter. The biggest tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, is the increased miles driven across the country. This leads to more failure- and maintenance-related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses. 
While we're -- while we focus on both the short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 38 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is an important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of fiscal 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably growing our commercial business; leveraging the Internet; improving inventory availability; and ""Yes! We've Got It.""
On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize, as customers have become much more tech- and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. 
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly, share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. 
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31%. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of Hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. 
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank again our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."
25307,325036269,944733,"AutoZone, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2016",2016-03-01,"Earnings Calls","AutoZone, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total Auto Parts sales, which includes our dome",1504,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. 
For the quarter, total Auto Parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 24 IMC branches, increased 5.4%. 
Switching over to macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.09 a gallon and ended the quarter at $1.72 a gallon, a $0.37 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.55 per gallon during the second quarter, starting at $2.82 and ending at $2.27 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. 
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both October, November and December, and we don't have January data yet. For all of 2015, miles driven finished up 3.5%, an incredibly strong number on a historical basis. It represents the largest percentage growth in over a decade. 
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store was $1,780,000. 
For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 8%. In the second quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $30 million over last year's Q2. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q2, some of this is due to slower growth from our lower mix of new programs. We've intensified the focus of our entire team, including our store managers, on reaccelerating our growth in commercial, and we have recently executed some incremental commercial training programs. 
This past quarter, we opened 32 net new programs versus 29 programs opened in our second quarter last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,228 stores supported by 179 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, 26% of the base. 
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs, and that will continue to be the case, albeit at a slightly moderated pace. 
This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 150 more programs over the next 2 quarters. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. 
In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner, and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 9 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 451 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second distribution center in the country, and it will support further central Mexico store growth.
As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth by over 2 percentage points. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, Mexico leadership continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. As the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters.
Regarding Brazil, we opened no stores in the quarter, remaining with 8 stores opened. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 29% year-over-year, the real devalued 41% this year versus last. 
This extraordinary volatility is managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil but have been encouraged by our improving operating performance. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2,257,000,000, an increase of 5.3% over last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 3.6% for the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 50 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. 
In regards to inflation, it remains subdued. In fact, in total, slightly to -- slightly down last year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, higher by 40 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable credit card litigation settlement recognized last year's quarter and higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. 
EBIT for the quarter was $383 million, up 6% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 17%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared with $35 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,845,000,000 or approximately $415 million more than last year's balance of $4,430,000,000.
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was slightly lower than last year's Q2 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned. Any deviations to our plan are driven primarily by the resolution of discrete tax items as they arise.
Net income for the quarter was $229 million and up 8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.8 million was down 5.4% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.43, up 14.2% over the prior year's second quarter.
Relating to the cash flow statement. For the second fiscal quarter, we generated $207 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled approximately $100 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,193 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 451 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,652. We also had 24 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,676.
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $60 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $150 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter-end, we had $548 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter-end. 
Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to do our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 109%.
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $633,000 versus $631,000 last year and $624,000 last quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are very pleased to report our 38th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 14.2% over the last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. 
Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong and ahead of our expectations, and we look forward to opening more later this year. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. 
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success.
Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. We have a lot of work in front of us over the next 2 quarters but the future continues to look bright.

Some of that, we would attribute to some weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast but not all of it. Frankly, we're not exactly sure all the reasons that we had a little bit of a slowdown.

So you weren't able to see that benefit in there. As I said earlier, Dan, some of the slowdown in commercial was clearly the maturation cycle, but some of it is, we were frankly disappointed -- marginally disappointed with our performance in commercial. Our team has all hands on deck. We had a spring sales meeting last week, and that was the predominant topic.

But I would say that I would give the credit back to the merchandising organization from an acquisition perspective, working with the vendors optimizing where we're buying the inventory, going direct on certain opportunities as well, increasing private label product where we have opportunities to do so. We're pretty well penetrated in private label today, but there are -- continues to be opportunities for us to expand penetration on private label and that has helped a little bit. So many of the improvements that I would say that we've seen, not all, but the majority are sustainable. And so I think that we've got a good playbook to continue to do that.

Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 30 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 8%, and we opened 32 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 9 stores this quarter. 
We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 2 new IMC branches, bringing our total branch count to 24. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth prospects in domestic locations, commercial, international and our other businesses. 
If I could sum up the quarter in a short statement, I would call out our major highlights, and I'd say we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while adding more labor hours in our stores in an effort to constantly improve our customers' experiences. 
While winter temperatures were milder this year than last, we did not see a material change in business trends from one month to the next, overall. Yes, certain cold weather categories, those that have larger sales during these months, were below last year's numbers while others balanced out our performance. And yes, as you would expect, our performance in the Midwest and Northeast were below other markets, but they were in line with our expectations considering the weather patterns. 
Probably the biggest unknown for us this quarter was when would income tax refunds begin to be remitted to consumers by the IRS. By quarter-end, total refunds were generally comparable to remittances last year, but they were issued very, very late in our quarter. 
We feel our Retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall fuel prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more. 
Regarding commercial, we saw colder weather markets growing sales at a slower pace than other markets. We believe the milder temperatures led to less failure-related repairs being done in those particular markets. However, we believe the mild temperatures will not have a material lasting effect on our sales performance heading into the summer. We feel a hot summer is the next thing we'll be watching for in regards to sales performance.
Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority, the business did quite well in the second quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis, and performance was generally consistent across the country. While the macro economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we also continued to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store label -- labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We're committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. 
Regarding Commercial, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry. Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the roll out of more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of 1,300 locations out of our 5,000-plus locations on multiple weekly deliveries.
As we've been discussing, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either 3 or 5x a week. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 700 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service model. 
The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 20 to 30 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. 
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was less than the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business, and our teams are executing it well and managing the cost effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense. 
Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the MegaHub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 MegaHubs, with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to open -- to add approximately 5 additional MegaHubs over the last 2 quarters of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. 
Our sales results thus far in our open MegaHubs continue to exceed our expectations. And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. 
Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently, 5 MegaHubs support approximately 700 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,000 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. 
Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
As I mentioned a few years ago -- or a few minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, ""Yes! We've Got It."" more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. 
As traffic has increased in our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes! We've Got It."" While still in the -- still early in the implementation training phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically, the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. 
We also want to touch on the efforts that are ongoing with regard to capturing data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. While still in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective on our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. 
This will be a significant endeavor for us over the next couple of years. We have spent a lot of time mapping through the capture of this data in order to leverage it to better serve our customers. We think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later on this initiative.
Lastly, in order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as MegaHubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18.
To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from past, we do expect to incur approximately 20 to 30 basis points gross margin headwind from these investments alone.
Now turning to the second quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.3% on top of 7.7% growth in Q2 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Our growth in both sales and earnings were very consistent with our results from Q1. This quarter's sales results were also very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, tax refunds, in total, were generally comparable to prior year. However, from a timing perspective, they flowed very late in the quarter. In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, failure-related product sales performed the best. Discretionary had the next highest growth rate, followed by maintenance. While all 3 showed nice growth, we attribute the variance in sales trends between these businesses to the timing of winter events, for example, the polar vortex effects this year versus last. 
As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, we opened 32 net new programs and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. While our total domestic sales grew 6% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 8%. The total -- the commercial sales growth rate, while still impressive, has slowed. Some of the reduction in growth is due to opening fewer new programs in recent years and having a lower percentage of the programs on the maturation curve.
Despite this expected change, our sales slowed a bit more than we expected and we are working diligently to gain back that momentum. In recent weeks, we've executed incremental trading and have enhanced the focus of our management teams, including store managers, on reaccelerating our commercial growth. We believe our future in this business remains quite bright.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened one additional hub location and now operate 179. In addition to opening, over time, more MegaHub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hub stores.
Regarding IMC, we opened 2 new branches this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone locations today, and we believe there are great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers. 
Regarding Mexico, we opened another 9 stores this quarter and now have 451 total locations in Mexico. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done quite well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate starting this summer in the June to July time frame as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases.
For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than 2 percentage points. At the end of the quarter, the peso was down 29% versus last year and 16% from the end of Q1. 
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 3% over the last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which include autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Each of these businesses operate in increasingly competitive environments, and our sales have slowed a bit. 
Again, while we understand weather this winter was warmer, we are optimistic for sales this upcoming quarter. The biggest tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, is the increased miles driven across the country. This leads to more failure- and maintenance-related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses. 
While we're -- while we focus on both the short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 38 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is an important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our MegaHubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of fiscal 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably growing our commercial business; leveraging the Internet; improving inventory availability; and ""Yes! We've Got It.""
On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize, as customers have become much more tech- and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. 
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly, share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. 
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31%. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of Hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. 
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank again our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."

Last year, gas prices decreased $0.55 per gallon during the second quarter, starting at $2.82 and ending at $2.27 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. 
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both October, November and December, and we don't have January data yet. For all of 2015, miles driven finished up 3.5%, an incredibly strong number on a historical basis. It represents the largest percentage growth in over a decade. 
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store was $1,780,000. 
For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 8%. In the second quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $30 million over last year's Q2. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q2, some of this is due to slower growth from our lower mix of new programs. We've intensified the focus of our entire team, including our store managers, on reaccelerating our growth in commercial, and we have recently executed some incremental commercial training programs. 
This past quarter, we opened 32 net new programs versus 29 programs opened in our second quarter last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,228 stores supported by 179 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, 26% of the base. 
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs, and that will continue to be the case, albeit at a slightly moderated pace. 
This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 150 more programs over the next 2 quarters. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. 
In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner, and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 9 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 451 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second distribution center in the country, and it will support further central Mexico store growth.
As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth by over 2 percentage points. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, Mexico leadership continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters.
Regarding Brazil, we opened no stores in the quarter, remaining with 8 stores opened. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 29% year-over-year, the real devalued 41% this year versus last. 
This extraordinary volatility is managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil but have been encouraged by our improving operating performance. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2,257,000,000, an increase of 5.3% over last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 3.6% for the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 50 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. 
In regards to inflation, it remains subdued. In fact, in total, slightly to -- slightly down last year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, higher by 40 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable credit card litigation settlement recognized last year's quarter and higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. 
EBIT for the quarter was $383 million, up 6% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 17%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared with $35 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,845,000,000 or approximately $415 million more than last year's balance of $4,430,000,000.
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was slightly lower than last year's Q2 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned. Any deviations to our plan are driven primarily by the resolution of discrete tax items as they arise.
Net income for the quarter was $229 million and up 8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.8 million was down 5.4% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.43, up 14.2% over the prior year's second quarter.
Relating to the cash flow statement. For the second fiscal quarter, we generated $207 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled approximately $100 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,193 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 451 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,652. We also had 24 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,676.
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $60 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $150 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter-end, we had $548 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter-end. 
Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 109%.
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $633,000 versus $631,000 last year and $624,000 last quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are very pleased to report our 38th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 14.2% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. 
Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our MegaHubs has been strong and ahead of our expectations, and we look forward to opening more later this year. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. 
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success.
Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. We have a lot of work in front of us over the next 2 quarters but the future continues to look bright.
Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Some of that, we would attribute to some weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast but not all of it. Frankly, we're not exactly sure all the reasons that we had a little bit of a slowdown. But we are very focused on taking our 1TEAM concept and getting our district managers, our store managers, along with our sales team, really reengaged in a big way and in a materially significant -- a more significant way than in the past.

But that would really be the only aberration, if you'll call it, from a CapEx perspective. Other than that, we're opening square footage at around 3% and continue to invest in our existing base stores to make sure that they look fresh and current every day, and then also to invest in technology in order to make sure our platforms can support our business as we grow."

Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complimenting our comments today are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Call to see them. 
To begin this morning, I want to thank all our AutoZoners for another solid quarter. In the third quarter, we continue to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of an additional 33 new stores, our Commercial business continued to grow with sales increasing 6.5% and we opened 46 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 82% of our domestic stores and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 7 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 1 new IMC branch, bringing our total branch count to 45. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we continue to see great growth prospects in international and our other new businesses. 
If I could sum up our quarters major highlights, we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while maintaining our efforts to constantly improve our customers' experiences. We continue to implement -- implementation of our multiple delivery frequency initiative, adding just over 300 locations this quarter. We now have approximately 1,600 of our stores receiving multiple distribution center deliveries each week and we added 2 additional MegaHub in the quarter, for a total 7 now, and are targeting to open 4 more by the end of the fiscal year and we have more in the real estate pipeline for next year. Additionally, we look -- continue to look for opportunities to expand our merchandise margins and our new global sourcing initiative is a significant part of our focus and while still early, those efforts are progressing well. 
We also experienced some challenges this quarter. Our same-store weekly sales performance was quite volatile during the quarter. We started the quarter very strong, but recall that last year's third quarter started very weak due to a shift in tax refund timing. Additionally, we had a few weeks of poor sales when the weather was materially colder and wetter than last year. On the surface, it appears that the quarter started strong and then moderated. But when you assess it on a 2-year basis, sales trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter. On a regional basis. Our performance in the Midwestern, mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were substantially below other markets, especially in late March all the way through the end of the quarter where temperatures were much cooler and it was much wetter than usual. 
We continue to feel our Retail businesses benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall gas prices. Lower gas prices, we feel are contributing to Americans driving more, although recent price increases at the pump have likely muted some of this benefit. Regarding Commercial. We underperformed relative to the overall business in the same weather impacted markets noted previously. We don't think we are alone. Some of our large national account customers have told us, and themselves, they too experienced weaker sales while temperatures were cooler than usual. What I'm most proud of is what we've done to address those challenges. We are focused on both our large and small accounts growth while incorporating a one-team approach in communicating with our customers. 
As I talked to customers, I continue to see tremendous opportunity to grow sales and we continue to be excited about the performance in future benefit of our inventory availability initiatives. But we really have only scratched the surface with what we can do here. The forecast of a hot summer, which we would welcome, along with continued store level execution, makes us optimistic about our sales potential heading into the summer. Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority. The business performance during the quarter was mixed. In markets unaffected by the weather patterns noted above, we continued to perform well. However, for the quarter, our DIY traffic count turned slightly negative and our average ticket trends were slightly lower than the first half of the year. While the overall macro economy will remain favorable for DIY, we also continue to gain shares and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store, with every customer. 
Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continue to rollout a more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of roughly 1,600 locations out of our 5,000-plus stores on multiple weekly deliveries. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. For the fourth quarter, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 350 additional stores, ending the fiscal year-end with around 1,950 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative continues to create a gross margin headwind due to higher supply chain costs of approximately 20 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. 
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was in line with the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change on how we do business and our teams are executing it well and managing the cost effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense. Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the MegaHubs stores. We ended the quarter with 7 MegaHubs and expect to add up to 4 additional MegaHubs this fourth quarter. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and stores service by other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open MegaHubs continue to exceed our expectations. 
And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our Retail and Commercial businesses. While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modestly. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative this year. Currently, 7 MegaHubs support approximately 800 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,200 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service to our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. As with last quarter, we continue to invest in training our AutoZoners to say ""Yes! We've Got It."", more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is the operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now is a time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. We understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers needs as customer service is a key part of our value proposition and a key differentiator. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes! We've Got It"". 
With the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically, the staff necessary to provide our customers with the WOW! Customer Service  experience they deserve. In regards to learning about our customer shopping behaviors, we are capturing data from all of our selling platforms. We know it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all our customers needs. While being several quarters away from truly using the data for marketing purposes, we believe having a holistic and seamless integral price live perspective of our customers will change the way we communicate our message. As we are devoting more resources to building these capabilities, we think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the MegaHubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next few years. At present, we're in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development. But the larger portion of the capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. Regarding our expectations for the capital required to open these new distribution centers. As we have completed further due diligence, we have updated our expected capital required to $55 million to $60 million per distribution center. To summarize our plans. We expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHubs locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 basis point gross margin headwind from the multiple weekly delivery rollouts. 
Now turning to the third quarter's results. Our sales increased 4% on top of 6.5% growth in Q3 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2%. Our sales growth in Q3 slowed from the first half of the year and our earnings growth moderated as well. We attribute the majority of the sales and related earnings deceleration to weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions where it was considerably cooler this year. In regards to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, both failure-related product sales and discretionary purchases easily exceeded maintenance this past quarter. Maintenance merchandise sales simply did not sell as expected and drove its piece of the mix below previous third quarter percentages. We attribute the variance in sales between these businesses to the regional differences. Specifically, spring-related items simply sold at a lesser clip as cooler temperatures prevailed in certain geographic areas. While our total domestic sales grew 4% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 6.5%. As previously discussed, we feel like the ongoing initiatives in place position us well for our summer selling season. We believe our sales potential heading into the fourth quarter remains bright. 
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 3 additional hub locations, now operate 182. In addition to opening overtime more MegaHub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to [ph] 225 stores as hubs. Regarding IMC, we opened 1 new branch this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. We've open 7-ed additional branches in Q3 of last year. The IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone stores on a same day basis and over 1,400 AutoZone stores through overnight shipment. Regarding Mexico. We opened another 7 stores this quarter and now have 458 total locations. 
While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate in the fall as you begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. However, the volatility in the oil markets directly correlate to the peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate and recently, the peso has weakened with oil price volatility. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by just over 1 percentage point. At the end of the quarter, the peso to U.S. dollar was 18% worse than last year.
Sales and our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything make up this segment of sales. The biggest sales tailwind at the moment in our opinion, remains the increased miles driven across the country. While volatility with weather has been the greatest headwind, increasing miles driven leads to more failure in maintenance-related demand and benefited both our DIY and DIFM business. But unusually cool weather leads to limited sales. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to consistently delivering strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is a very important milestone for us. 
On our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our MegaHubs lapped some headwinds in our operating margins for the remainder 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels. Now I'm going to review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business; leveraging the Internet; improving inventory availability and ""Yes! We've Got It."" On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we remain focused on improving our store level execution. While we've added payroll this year, we are also stressing to our AutoZoners the importance of communicating our ever improving availability message. We've also been aggressive in our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all of the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. 
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly, share of voice. To educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance and return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are proud of this metric, and is one of the best, it has one of the best, if not the best in all of Hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business, provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. 
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total Auto Parts sales, which includes our domest",1823,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total Auto Parts sales, which includes our domestic, Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 25 IMC branches, increased 4.1%. Now switching to macro trends. During the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out as $1.72 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.22 a gallon on a $0.50 increase. Last year, gas prices increased $0.42 per gallon during the third quarter starting at $2.27 and ending at $2.69 a gallon. It is usual for gas prices to go up during this time of a year as summer blend begins to take effect with the refiners. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers ability to maintain their vehicles and has cost reductions help all Americans, we hope continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. 
We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both January and February, we don't have March or April data yet. The other statistic we highlight is a number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters. Total sales per average AutoZone store were $1,785,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.5%. In the third quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over the last year's Q3. As Bill said previously, we remain confident in our strategies to grow sales for this customer base for many years to come and we are particularly excited about the long-term benefits our inventory availability initiative will provide. 
Our commercial sales growth has decelerated some from the pace we have experienced in the last few years. In prior years, we had much larger percentage of our commercial programs recently opened or going through the maturation cycle. As more of our programs have matured, the contribution to our sales growth of the maturation cycle has declined. This only partially contributed to our decelerated growth this past quarter. Regarding Q3 in particular, we also experienced lower growth in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets where the spring season has been very late to arrive. These markets commercial sales performance was materially below other regions for us. This past quarter, we opened 46 net new programs versus 72 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program at 4,274 stores supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, which is about 24% of the base. 
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 120 more programs in Q4 alone. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing new additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share as we continue to grow profitably. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come. 
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 458 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second D.C. in the country, and it will support further central Mexico store growth. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth rate by 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership team continues to do an exceptional job, managing the peso-denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings into the fall. Regarding Brazil. We did not open stores in the quarter and continue to operate 8 stores. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollar as well. Similar to the peso's challenges versus the dollar, the real devalued 17% this year versus last year. 
When we embark on this initiative, our intent is to be very methodical and measured as we entered and learned about this market. Our objective was to assess whether or not our model was embraced by the Brazilian consumer and whether or not it is financially viable. We also wanted to very carefully manage the risk associated with entering a new market. We have determined that our model works well for the consumer and we continue to make good progress on the economic operating model, although we continue to operate the loss currency. However, it's difficult to determine the long-term economic model to such a small group of stores therefore, we decided to reinitiate our store development efforts with a goal over the next few years to expand the store base to 20 to 25 locations. We characterize this as an expansion of our initial test. We haven't declared success or built long-term expansion plans, but we are encouraged by the progress we've made and believe our progress warrants going into the next phase. 
Now recapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,594,000,000, an increase of 4% over last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 2% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 58 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, it remains of subdued down slightly last year. Apparently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. 
SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher legal expenses. The legal expense was driven by a single discrete item I should also point out, like the previous 2 quarters this fiscal years, we have deleverage from our store payroll initiatives, the view of our customer service is a key differentiator for us versus the competition and we remain committed to investing in our AutoZoners. We believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. 
EBIT for the quarter was $536 million, up 4.4% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million compared with $32 million in Q3 a year ago. We expect our upcoming fourth quarter's interest expense to be up from last year's fourth quarter by a similar amount. As we sold $650 million of bonds this past quarter, the coupon was higher than the retired commercial paper, thereby raising interest expense. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,950,000,000 or approximately $400 million more than last year's balance of approximately $4.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.56x EBITDAR, while on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
For the quarter, our tax rate at 34.8% was lower than last year's Q3 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned as we had a discrete item that lowered our tax rate. And expected ongoing rate for us is approximately 36%. Net income for the quarter was $328 million and up 6% over last year. Our diluted share count of $30.4 million was down 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter, $10.77 up 12.6% over the prior year's third quarter. As Bill said in the press release, this morning, the quarter was impacted by a legal charge along with the discrete tax benefit, which netted to a reduction to earnings per share of $0.11 per share. 
Now relating to the cash flow statement for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $516 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new locations this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,226 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 458 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,692. We also had 25 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter and taking our total locations to 5,717. 
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $62 million, in addition, the recent quarter in line with the recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $533 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter at quarter end, we had $765 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.56x at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we managed our appropriate credit ratings and not at any 1 metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. 
Accounts payable as a percent of growth inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total on a per location basis. Company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores delivered over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $629,000 consistent with last year and $633,000 last quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted on return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters, of [ph] 31.2%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are very pleased to report our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth growing this quarter at a rate of 12.6% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot, and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our MegaHubs has been strong and ahead of our expectations and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our Retail and Commercial businesses. 
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long-term. We believe our steady consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we're investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong earnings per share growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. 
We are proud of our results this past quarter. But we are capable of doing better. We have a lot of work in front of us, but the future looks bright. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all our AutoZoners for another solid quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of an additional 33 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 6.5%. And we opened 46 net new programs for the quarter. We now have a commercial program in 82% of our domestic stores. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 7 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 1 new IMC branch, bringing our total branch count to 25. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we continue to see great growth prospects in international and our other businesses.
If I could sum up our quarter's major highlights. We continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while maintaining our efforts to constantly improve our customers' experiences. We continued the implement -- implementation of our multiple delivery frequency initiative, adding just over 300 locations this quarter. We now have approximately 1,600 of our stores receiving multiple distribution center deliveries each week. And we added 2 additional Mega Hubs in the quarter, for a total of 7 now; and are targeting to open 4 more by the end of the fiscal year. And we have more in the real estate pipeline for next year. Additionally, we look -- continue to look for opportunities to expand our merchandise margins. And our new global sourcing initiative is a significant part of our focus, and while still early, those efforts are progressing well.
We also experienced some challenges this quarter. Our same-store weekly sales performance was quite volatile during the quarter. We started the quarter very strong, but recall that last year's third quarter started very weak due to a shift in tax refund timing. Additionally, we had a few weeks of poor sales when the weather was materially colder and wetter than last year. On the surface, it appears that the quarter started strong and then moderated, but when you assess it on a 2-year basis, sales trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter. On a regional basis, our performance in the Midwestern, mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were substantially below other markets, especially in late March all the way through the end of the quarter, where temperatures were much cooler and it was much wetter than usual.
We continued to feel our retail businesses benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall gas prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more, although recent price increases at the pump have likely muted some of these benefits. Regarding commercial, we underperformed relative to the overall business in the same weather-impacted markets noted previously. We don't think we are alone. Some of our large national account customers have told us and yourselves they too experienced weaker sales while temperatures were cooler than usual.
What I'm most proud of is what we've done to address those challenges. We are focused on both our large and small account sales growth while incorporating a one-team approach in communicating with our customers. As I talk to customers, I continue to see tremendous opportunity to grow sales. And we continue to be excited about the performance and future benefit of our inventory availability initiatives, but we really have only scratched the surface with what we can do here. The forecast of a hot summer, which we would welcome, along with continued store-level execution, makes us optimistic about our sales potential heading into the summer.
Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority. The business performance during the quarter was mixed. In markets unaffected by the weather patterns noted above, we continued to perform well. However, for the quarter, our DIY traffic count turned slightly negative and our ticket -- average ticket trends were slightly lower than the first half of the year. While the overall macro economy will remain favorable for DIY, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store, with every customer.
Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued to roll out more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of roughly 1,600 locations out of our 5,000-plus stores on multiple weekly deliveries. Our results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes at our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. For the fourth quarter, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 350 additional stores, ending the fiscal year-end with around 1,950 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative continues to create a gross margin headwind due to higher supply chain costs of approximately 20 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries.
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was in line with the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change on how we do business, and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense.
Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the Mega Hub stores. We ended the quarter with 7 Mega Hubs and expect to add up to 4 additional Mega Hubs this fourth quarter. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and stores serviced by other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses.
While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative this year. Currently, 7 Mega Hubs support approximately 800 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,200 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of Mega Hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our Mega Hub expansion over the next few years.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service to our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. As with last quarter, we continued to invest in training our AutoZoners to say, ""Yes, we've got it,"" more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is the operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is a time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. We understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs, as customer service is a key part of our value proposition and a key differentiator. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes, we've got it."" With the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with the WOW! Customer Service  experience they deserve.
In regards to learning about our customers' shopping behaviors, we are capturing data from all of our selling platforms. We know it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all our customers' needs. While being several quarters away from truly using the data for marketing purposes, we believe having a holistic and seamless integral price-wide [ph] perspective of our customers will change the way we communicate our message. As we are devoting more resources to building these capabilities, we think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as to Mega Hubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next few years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of the capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. Regarding our expectations for the capital required to open these new distribution centers, as we have completed further due diligence, we have updated our expected capital required to $55 million to $60 million per distribution center.
To summarize our plans. We expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more Mega Hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 basis point gross margin headwind from the multiple weekly delivery rollouts.
Now turning to the third quarter's results.
Our sales increased 4%, on top of 6.5% growth in Q3 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2%. Our sales growth in Q3 slowed from the first half of the year, and our earnings growth moderated as well. We attribute the majority of the sales and related earnings deceleration to weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions where it was considerably cooler this year.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, both failure-related product sales and discretionary purchases easily exceeded maintenance this past quarter. Maintenance merchandise sales simply did not sell as expected and drove its piece of the mix below previous third quarter percentages. We attribute the variance in sales between these businesses to the regional differences. Specifically, spring-related items simply sold at a lesser clip as cooler temperatures prevailed in certain geographic areas. While our total domestic sales grew 4% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 6.5%. As previously discussed, we feel like the ongoing initiatives in place position us well for our summer selling season. We believe our sales potential heading into the fourth quarter remains bright.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 3 additional hub locations and now operate 182. In addition to opening over time more Mega Hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs. Regarding IMC, we opened 1 new branch this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. We've opened 7 additional branches since Q3 of last year. The IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone stores on a same-day basis and over 1,400 AutoZone stores through overnight shipment.
Regarding Mexico, we opened another 7 stores this quarter and now have 458 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate in the fall as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. However, the volatility in the oil markets directly correlate to the ""peso to the U.S. dollar"" exchange rate, and recently, the peso has weakened with oil price volatility. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by just over 1 percentage point. At the end of the quarter, the peso to U.S. dollar was at -- was 18% worse than last year.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. The biggest sales tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, remains the increased miles driven across the country. While volatility with weather has been the greatest headwind, increasing miles driven leads to more failure- and maintenance-related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses, but unusually cool weather leads to limited sales. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to consistently delivering strong earnings performance; and extending our streak of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is a very important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our Mega Hubs will have some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.
Now I'm going to review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability and ""Yes! We've Got It."" On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we remained focused on improving our store-level execution. While we've added payroll this year, we were also stressing to our AutoZoners the importance of communicating our ever-improving availability message. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize, as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all of the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are proud of this metric, as it is one of the best -- as it's one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."

And good morning, everyone.To start up this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our d",1825,"Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone.
To start up this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.
For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 25 IMC branches, increased 4.1%. Now switching to macro trends: During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $1.72 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.22 a gallon on a $0.50 increase. Last year, gas prices increased $0.42 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $2.27 and ending at $2.69 a gallon. It is usual for gas prices to go up during this time of year, as summer blend begins to take effect with the refiners. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both January and February. We don't have March or April data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.
For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store were $1,785,000.
For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.5%. In the third quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q3. As Bill said previously, we remain confident in our strategies to grow sales for this customer base for many years to come. And we are particularly excited about the long-term benefits our inventory availability initiative will provide. Our commercial sales growth has decelerated some from the pace we have experienced in the last few years. In prior years, we had a much larger percentage of our commercial programs recently opened or going through the maturation cycle. As more of our programs have matured, the contribution to our sales growth of the maturation cycle has declined. This only partially contributed to our decelerated growth this past quarter. Regarding Q3 in particular, we also experienced lower growth in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where the spring season has been very late to arrive. These markets' commercial sales performance was materially below other regions for us.
This past quarter, we opened 46 net new programs versus 72 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,274 stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, which is about 24% of the base.
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 120 more programs in Q4 alone. We have a very talented sales force. And we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share as we continue to grow profitably. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.
Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 458 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second DC in the country, and it will support further Central Mexico store growth. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth rate by 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership team continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings into the fall.
Regarding Brazil. We did not open stores in the quarter and continued to operate 8 stores. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. Similar to the peso's challenges versus the dollar, the real has devalued 17% this year versus last year.
When we embarked on this initiative, our intentions were to be very methodical and measured as we entered and learned about this market. Our objective was to assess whether or not our model was embraced by the Brazilian consumer and whether or not it was financially viable. We also wanted to very carefully manage the risks associated with entering a new market. We have determined that our model works well for the consumer. And we continue to make good progress on the economic operating model, although we continue to operate at a loss currently. However, it is difficult to determine the long-term economic model with such a small group of stores. Therefore, we've decided to reinitiate our store development efforts, with the goal over the next few years to expand the store base to 20 to 25 locations. We characterize this as an expansion of our initial test. We haven't declared success or built long-term expansion plans, but we are encouraged by the progress we've made and believe our progress warrants going into the next phase.
Now recapping this past quarter's performance for the company.
In total, our sales were $2,594,000,000, an increase of 4% over last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 2% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 58 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current-year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, it remains subdued, down slightly last year. Apparently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher legal expenses. The legal expense was driven by a single discrete item. I should also point out, like the previous 2 quarters this fiscal year's, we have deleveraged from our store payroll initiatives. We feel our customer service is a key differentiator for us versus the competition. And we remain committed to investing in our AutoZoners. We believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $536 million, up 4.4% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%.
Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million compared with $32 million in Q3 a year ago. We expect our upcoming fourth quarter's interest expense to be up from last year's fourth quarter by a similar amount. As we sold $650 million of bonds this past quarter, the coupon was higher than the retired commercial paper, thereby raising interest expense.
Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,950,000,000 or approximately $400 million more than last year's balance of approximately $4.5 billion. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.56x EBITDAR. While on any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate at 34.8% was lower than last year's Q3 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned, as we had a discrete item that lowered our tax rate. And expected ongoing rate for us is approximately 36%.
Net income for the quarter was $328 million and up 6% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.4 million was down 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.77, up 12.6% over the prior year's third quarter. As Bill said in the press release this morning, the quarter was impacted by a legal charge, along with the discrete tax benefit, which netted to a reduction to earnings per share of $0.11 per share.
Now relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $516 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $113.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels or openings; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,226 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 458 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,692. We also had 25 IMC branches open at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,717.
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $62 million; in addition, the recent quarter in line with the recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $533 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end, we had $765 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. And our leverage metric was 2.56x at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.
Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%.
Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total on a per-location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $629,000, consistent with last year; and $633,000 last quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make the investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are very pleased to report our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 12.6% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives. And we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance at our Mega Hub has been strong and ahead of our expectations, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong earnings per share growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.
We are proud of our results this past quarter, but we are capable of doing better. We have a lot of work in front of us, but the future looks bright.
We now would like to open up the call for questions."

After he bought them, we quickly started increasing the branch count. We were at 17 branches less than 2 years ago, when we acquired them. We're now at 25. That's over 50% growth or right at 50% growth. And frankly, we probably got a little bit out in front of our skis. We were moving too fast for an organization that had not opened a lot of branches over time. And we were also doing a lot of integration efforts with AutoZone. And so we've slowed down a little bit and then tend to slow down our branch growth and really work on the fundamentals of the business in the 25 branches that we have and then restart the branch expansion later. We are using -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about 700 stores that are using and selling IMC parts. That is just to supplement our commercial offerings.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.
Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all our AutoZoners for another solid quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of an additional 33 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 6.5%. And we opened 46 net new programs for the quarter. We now have a commercial program in 82% of our domestic stores. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 7 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 1 new IMC branch, bringing our total branch count to 25. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we continue to see great growth prospects in international and our other businesses.
If I could sum up our quarter's major highlights. We continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while maintaining our efforts to constantly improve our customers' experiences. We continued the implement -- implementation of our multiple delivery frequency initiative, adding just over 300 locations this quarter. We now have approximately 1,600 of our stores receiving multiple distribution center deliveries each week. And we added 2 additional Mega Hubs in the quarter, for a total of 7 now, and are targeting to open 4 more by the end of the fiscal year. And we have more in the real estate pipeline for next year. Additionally, we look -- continue to look for opportunities to expand our merchandise margins. And our new global sourcing initiative is a significant part of our focus. And while still early, those efforts are progressing well.
We also experienced some challenges this quarter. Our same-store weekly sales performance was quite volatile during the quarter. We started the quarter very strong, but recall that last year's third quarter started very weak due to a shift in tax refund timing. Additionally, we had a few weeks of poor sales when the weather was materially colder and wetter than last year. On the surface, it appears that the quarter started strong and then moderated, but when you assess it on a 2-year basis, sales trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter. On a regional basis, our performance in the Midwestern, mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were substantially below other markets, especially in late March all the way through the end of the quarter, where temperatures were much cooler and it was much wetter than usual.
We continued to feel our retail businesses benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall gas prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more, although recent price increases at the pump have likely muted some of this benefit. Regarding commercial, we underperformed relative to the overall business in the same weather-impacted markets noted previously. We don't think we are alone. Some of our large national account customers have told us and yourselves they too experienced weaker sales while temperatures were cooler than usual.
What I'm most proud of is what we've done to address those challenges. We are focused on both our large and small account sales growth while incorporating a one-team approach in communicating with our customers. As I talk to customers, I continue to see tremendous opportunity to grow sales. And we continue to be excited about the performance and future benefit of our inventory availability initiatives, but we really have only scratched the surface with what we can do here. The forecast of a hot summer, which we would welcome, along with continued store-level execution, makes us optimistic about our sales potential heading into the summer.
Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority. The business performance during the quarter was mixed. In markets unaffected by the weather patterns noted above, we continued to perform well. However, for the quarter, our DIY traffic count turned slightly negative and our ticket -- average ticket trends were slightly lower than the first half of the year. While the overall macro economy will remain favorable for DIY, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store, with every customer.
Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued to roll out more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of roughly 1,600 locations out of our 5,000-plus stores on multiple weekly deliveries. Our results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes at our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. For the fourth quarter, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 350 additional stores, ending the fiscal year-end with around 1,950 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative continues to create a gross margin headwind due to higher supply chain costs of approximately 20 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries.
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was in line with the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change on how we do business, and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense.
Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the Mega Hub stores. We ended the quarter with 7 Mega Hubs and expect to add up to 4 additional Mega Hubs this fourth quarter. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and stores serviced by other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses.
While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative this year. Currently, 7 Mega Hubs support approximately 800 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,200 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of Mega Hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our Mega Hub expansion over the next few years.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service to our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. As with last quarter, we continued to invest in training our AutoZoners to say, ""Yes, we've got it,"" more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is the operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is a time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. We understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs, as customer service is a key part of our value proposition and a key differentiator. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes, we've got it."" With the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with the WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve.
In regards to learning about our customers' shopping behaviors, we are capturing data from all of our selling platforms. We know it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all our customers' needs. While being several quarters away from truly using the data for marketing purposes, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will change the way we communicate our message. As we are devoting more resources to building these capabilities, we think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as to Mega Hubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next few years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of the capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. Regarding our expectations for the capital required to open these new distribution centers, as we have completed further due diligence, we have updated our expected capital required to $55 million to $60 million per distribution center.
To summarize our plans. We expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more Mega Hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 basis point gross margin headwind from the multiple weekly delivery rollouts.
Now turning to the third quarter's results.
Our sales increased 4%, on top of 6.5% growth in Q3 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2%. Our sales growth in Q3 slowed from the first half of the year, and our earnings growth moderated as well. We attribute the majority of the sales and related earnings deceleration to weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions where it was considerably cooler this year.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, both failure-related product sales and discretionary purchases easily exceeded maintenance this past quarter. Maintenance merchandise sales simply did not sell as expected and drove its piece of the mix below previous third quarter percentages. We attribute the variance in sales between these businesses to the regional differences. Specifically, spring-related items simply sold at a lesser clip as cooler temperatures prevailed in certain geographic areas. While our total domestic sales grew 4% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 6.5%. As previously discussed, we feel like the ongoing initiatives in place position us well for our summer selling season. We believe our sales potential heading into the fourth quarter remains bright.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 3 additional hub locations and now operate 182. In addition to opening over time more Mega Hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs. Regarding IMC, we opened 1 new branch this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. We've opened 7 additional branches since Q3 of last year. The IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone stores on a same-day basis and over 1,400 AutoZone stores through overnight shipment.
Regarding Mexico, we opened another 7 stores this quarter and now have 458 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate in the fall as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. However, the volatility in the oil markets directly correlate to the peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, and recently, the peso has weakened with oil price volatility. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by just over 1 percentage point. At the end of the quarter, the peso to U.S. dollar was at -- was 18% worse than last year.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. The biggest sales tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, remains the increased miles driven across the country. While volatility with weather has been the greatest headwind, increasing miles driven leads to more failure- and maintenance-related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses, but unusually cool weather leads to limited sales. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to consistently delivering strong earnings performance; and extending our streak of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is a very important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our Mega Hubs will have some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.
Now I'm going to review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability and ""Yes! We've Got It."" On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we remained focused on improving our store-level execution. While we've added payroll this year, we were also stressing to our AutoZoners the importance of communicating our ever-improving availability message. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize, as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all of the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are proud of this metric, as it is one of the best -- as it's one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."

And good morning, everyone.To start up this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our d",1828,"Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone.
To start up this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.
For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 25 IMC branches, increased 4.1%. Now switching to macro trends: During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $1.72 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.22 a gallon, a $0.50 increase. Last year, gas prices increased $0.42 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $2.27 and ending at $2.69 a gallon. It is usual for gas prices to go up during this time of year, as summer blend begins to take effect with the refiners. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both January and February. We don't have March or April data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.
For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store were $1,785,000.
For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.5%. In the third quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q3. As Bill said previously, we remain confident in our strategies to grow sales with this customer base for many years to come. And we are particularly excited about the long-term benefits our inventory availability initiative will provide. Our commercial sales growth has decelerated some from the pace we have experienced in the last few years. In prior years, we had a much larger percentage of our commercial programs recently opened or going through the maturation cycle. As more of our programs have matured, the contribution to our sales growth of the maturation cycle has declined. This only partially contributed to our decelerated growth this past quarter. Regarding Q3 in particular, we also experienced lower growth in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where the spring season has been very late to arrive. These markets' commercial sales performance was materially below other regions for us.
This past quarter, we opened 46 net new programs versus 72 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,274 stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, which is about 24% of the base.
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 120 more programs in Q4 alone. We have a very talented sales force. And we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share as we continue to grow profitably. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.
Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 458 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second DC in the country, and it will support further Central Mexico store growth. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth rate by 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership team continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings into the fall.
Regarding Brazil. We did not open stores in the quarter and continued to operate 8 stores. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. Similar to the peso's challenges versus the dollar, the real has devalued 17% this year versus last year.
When we embarked on this initiative, our intentions were to be very methodical and measured as we entered and learned about this market. Our objective was to assess whether or not our model was embraced by the Brazilian consumer and whether or not it was financially viable. We also wanted to very carefully manage the risks associated with entering a new market. We have determined that our model works well for the consumer. And we continue to make good progress on the economic operating model, although we continue to operate at a loss currently. However, it is difficult to determine the long-term economic model with such a small group of stores. Therefore, we've decided to reinitiate our store development efforts, with the goal over the next few years to expand the store base to 20 to 25 locations. We characterize this as an expansion of our initial test. We haven't declared success or built long-term expansion plans, but we are encouraged by the progress we've made and believe our progress warrants going to the next phase.
Now recapping this past quarter's performance for the company.
In total, our sales were $2,594,000,000, an increase of 4% over last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 2% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 58 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current-year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, it remains subdued, down slightly to last year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher legal expenses. The legal expense was driven by a single discrete item. I should also point out, like the previous 2 quarters this fiscal year's, we have deleveraged from our store payroll initiatives. We feel our customer service is a key differentiator for us versus the competition. And we remain committed to investing in our AutoZoners. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $536 million, up 4.4% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%.
Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million compared with $32 million in Q3 a year ago. We expect our upcoming fourth quarter's interest expense to be up from last year's fourth quarter by a similar amount. As we sold $650 million of bonds this past quarter, the coupon was higher than the retired commercial paper, thereby raising interest expense.
Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,950,000,000 or approximately $400 million more than last year's balance of approximately $4.5 billion. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.56x EBITDAR. While on any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate at 34.8% was lower than last year's Q3 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned, as we had a discrete item that lowered our tax rate. And expected ongoing rate for us is approximately 36%.
Net income for the quarter was $328 million and up 6% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.4 million was down 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.77, up 12.6% over the prior year's third quarter. As Bill said in the press release this morning, the quarter was impacted by a legal charge, along with the discrete tax benefit, which netted to a reduction to earnings per share of $0.11 per share.
Now relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $516 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $113.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels or openings; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,226 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 458 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,692. We also had 25 IMC branches open at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,717.
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $62 million; in addition, the recent quarter in line with the recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $533 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end, we had $765 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. And our leverage metric was 2.56x at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.
Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%.
Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $629,000, consistent with last year; and $633,000 last quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make the investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are very pleased to report our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 12.6% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives. And we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance at our Mega Hub has been strong and ahead of our expectations, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong earnings per share growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.

After we bought them, we quickly started increasing the branch count. We were at 17 branches less than 2 years ago, when we acquired them. We're now at 25. That's over 50% growth or right at 50% growth. And frankly, we probably got a little bit out in front of our skis. We were moving too fast for an organization that had not opened a lot of branches over time. And we were also doing a lot of integration efforts with AutoZone. And so we've slowed down a little bit and intend to slow down our branch growth and really work on the fundamentals of the business in the 25 branches that we have and then restart the branch expansion later. We are using -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about 700 stores that are using and selling IMC parts. That is just to supplement our commercial offerings. It's not going to be a radical change in the sales trajectory of our commercial business, but it's a nice way to say, ""Yes, we've got it"", to a commercial customer who has a unique need."

Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all our AutoZoners for another solid quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of an additional 33 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 6.5%. And we opened 46 net new programs for the quarter. We now have a commercial program in 82% of our domestic stores. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 7 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 1 new IMC branch, bringing our total branch count to 25. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we continue to see great growth prospects in international and our other businesses.
If I could sum up our quarter's major highlights. We continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while maintaining our efforts to constantly improve our customers' experiences. We continued the implement -- implementation of our multiple delivery frequency initiative, adding just over 300 locations this quarter. We now have approximately 1,600 of our stores receiving multiple distribution center deliveries each week. And we added 2 additional Mega Hubs in the quarter, for a total of 7 now, and are targeting to open 4 more by the end of the fiscal year. And we have more in the real estate pipeline for next year. Additionally, we look -- continue to look for opportunities to expand our merchandise margins. And our new global sourcing initiative is a significant part of our focus. And while still early, those efforts are progressing well.
We also experienced some challenges this quarter. Our same-store weekly sales performance was quite volatile during the quarter. We started the quarter very strong, but recall that last year's third quarter started very weak due to a shift in tax refund timing. Additionally, we had a few weeks of poor sales when the weather was materially colder and wetter than last year. On the surface, it appears that the quarter started strong and then moderated, but when you assess it on a 2-year basis, sales trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter. On a regional basis, our performance in the Midwestern, mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were substantially below other markets, especially in late March all the way through the end of the quarter, where temperatures were much cooler and it was much wetter than usual.
We continued to feel our retail businesses benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability and lower overall gas prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more, although recent price increases at the pump have likely muted some of this benefit. Regarding commercial, we underperformed relative to the overall business in the same weather-impacted markets noted previously. We don't think we are alone. Some of our large national account customers have told us and yourselves they too experienced weaker sales while temperatures were cooler than usual.
What I'm most proud of is what we've done to address those challenges. We are focused on both our large and small account sales growth while incorporating a one-team approach in communicating with our customers. As I talk to customers, I continue to see tremendous opportunity to grow sales. And we continue to be excited about the performance and future benefit of our inventory availability initiatives, but we really have only scratched the surface with what we can do here. The forecast of a hot summer, which we would welcome, along with continued store-level execution, makes us optimistic about our sales potential heading into the summer.
Getting back to DIY, our #1 business priority. The business performance during the quarter was mixed. In markets unaffected by the weather patterns noted above, we continued to perform well. However, for the quarter, our DIY traffic count turned slightly negative and our ticket -- average ticket trends were slightly lower than the first half of the year. While the overall macro economy will remain favorable for DIY, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store, with every customer.
Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued to roll out more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of roughly 1,600 locations out of our 5,000-plus stores on multiple weekly deliveries. Our results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes at our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. For the fourth quarter, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 350 additional stores, ending the fiscal year-end with around 1,950 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative continues to create a gross margin headwind due to higher supply chain costs of approximately 20 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries.
This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was in line with the previous quarter. I appreciate our team's efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change on how we do business, and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense.
Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the Mega Hub stores. We ended the quarter with 7 Mega Hubs and expect to add up to 4 additional Mega Hubs this fourth quarter. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and stores serviced by other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. And we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses.
While there's incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative this year. Currently, 7 Mega Hubs support approximately 800 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,200 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of Mega Hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our Mega Hub expansion over the next few years.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service to our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. As with last quarter, we continued to invest in training our AutoZoners to say, ""Yes, we've got it,"" more frequently. ""Yes! We've Got It."" is the operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is a time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. We understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs, as customer service is a key part of our value proposition and a key differentiator. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, ""Yes, we've got it."" With the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with the WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve.
In regards to learning about our customers' shopping behaviors, we are capturing data from all of our selling platforms. We know it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all our customers' needs. While being several quarters away from truly using the data for marketing purposes, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will change the way we communicate our message. As we are devoting more resources to building these capabilities, we think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as to Mega Hubs, we continue to expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next few years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of the capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. Regarding our expectations for the capital required to open these new distribution centers, as we have completed further due diligence, we have updated our expected capital required to $55 million to $60 million per distribution center.
To summarize our plans. We expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more Mega Hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 basis point gross margin headwind from the multiple weekly delivery rollouts.
Now turning to the third quarter's results.
Our sales increased 4%, on top of 6.5% growth in Q3 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2%. Our sales growth in Q3 slowed from the first half of the year, and our earnings growth moderated as well. We attribute the majority of the sales and related earnings deceleration to weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions where it was considerably cooler this year.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits in our U.S. stores, both failure-related product sales and discretionary purchases easily exceeded maintenance this past quarter. Maintenance merchandise sales simply did not sell as expected and drove its piece of the mix below previous third quarter percentages. We attribute the variance in sales between these businesses to the regional differences. Specifically, spring-related items simply sold at a lesser clip as cooler temperatures prevailed in certain geographic areas. While our total domestic sales grew 4% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 6.5%. As previously discussed, we feel like the ongoing initiatives in place position us well for our summer selling season. We believe our sales potential heading into the fourth quarter remains bright.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 3 additional hub locations and now operate 182. In addition to opening over time more Mega Hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs. Regarding IMC, we opened 1 new branch this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. We've opened 7 additional branches since Q3 of last year. The IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone stores on a same-day basis and over 1,400 AutoZone stores through overnight shipment.
Regarding Mexico, we opened another 7 stores this quarter and now have 458 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate in the fall as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. However, the volatility in the oil markets directly correlate to the peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, and recently, the peso has weakened with oil price volatility. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by just over 1 percentage point. At the end of the quarter, the peso to U.S. dollar was at -- was 18% worse than last year.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. The biggest sales tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, remains the increased miles driven across the country. While volatility with weather has been the greatest headwind, increasing miles driven leads to more failure- and maintenance-related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses, but unusually cool weather leads to limited sales. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to consistently delivering strong earnings performance; and extending our streak of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is a very important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our Mega Hubs will have some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels.
Now I'm going to review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability and ""Yes! We've Got It."" On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we remained focused on improving our store-level execution. While we've added payroll this year, we were also stressing to our AutoZoners the importance of communicating our ever-improving availability message. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize, as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all of the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.
On the ""Yes! We've Got It."" front, we've added training, metrics and most importantly share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are proud of this metric, as it is one of the best -- as it's one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles."

And good morning, everyone.To start up this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our d",1828,"Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone.
To start up this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.
For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 25 IMC branches, increased 4.1%. Now switching to macro trends: During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $1.72 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.22 a gallon, a $0.50 increase. Last year, gas prices increased $0.42 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $2.27 and ending at $2.69 a gallon. It is usual for gas prices to go up during this time of year, as summer blend begins to take effect with the refiners. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both January and February. We don't have March or April data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.
For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store were $1,785,000.
For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.5%. In the third quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q3. As Bill said previously, we remain confident in our strategies to grow sales with this customer base for many years to come. And we are particularly excited about the long-term benefits our inventory availability initiative will provide. Our commercial sales growth has decelerated some from the pace we have experienced in the last few years. In prior years, we had a much larger percentage of our commercial programs recently opened or going through the maturation cycle. As more of our programs have matured, the contribution to our sales growth of the maturation cycle has declined. This only partially contributed to our decelerated growth this past quarter. Regarding Q3 in particular, we also experienced lower growth in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, where the spring season has been very late to arrive. These markets' commercial sales performance was materially below other regions for us.
This past quarter, we opened 46 net new programs versus 72 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,274 stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger, which is about 24% of the base.
With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. This year, we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 120 more programs in Q4 alone. We have a very talented sales force. And we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share as we continue to grow profitably. We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.
Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 458 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second DC in the country, and it will support further Central Mexico store growth. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth rate by 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership team continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings into the fall.
Regarding Brazil. We did not open stores in the quarter and continued to operate 8 stores. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. Similar to the peso's challenges versus the dollar, the real has devalued 17% this year versus last year.
When we embarked on this initiative, our intentions were to be very methodical and measured as we entered and learned about this market. Our objective was to assess whether or not our model was embraced by the Brazilian consumer and whether or not it was financially viable. We also wanted to very carefully manage the risks associated with entering a new market. We have determined that our model works well for the consumer. And we continue to make good progress on the economic operating model, although we continue to operate at a loss currently. However, it is difficult to determine the long-term economic model with such a small group of stores. Therefore, we've decided to reinitiate our store development efforts, with the goal over the next few years to expand the store base to 20 to 25 locations. We characterize this as an expansion of our initial test. We haven't declared success or built long-term expansion plans, but we are encouraged by the progress we've made and believe our progress warrants going to the next phase.
Now recapping this past quarter's performance for the company.
In total, our sales were $2,594,000,000, an increase of 4% over last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 2% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 58 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current-year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, it remains subdued, down slightly to last year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher legal expenses. The legal expense was driven by a single discrete item. I should also point out, like the previous 2 quarters this fiscal year's, we have deleveraged from our store payroll initiatives. We feel our customer service is a key differentiator for us versus the competition. And we remain committed to investing in our AutoZoners. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $536 million, up 4.4% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%.
Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million compared with $32 million in Q3 a year ago. We expect our upcoming fourth quarter's interest expense to be up from last year's fourth quarter by a similar amount. As we sold $650 million of bonds this past quarter, the coupon was higher than the retired commercial paper, thereby raising interest expense.
Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,950,000,000 or approximately $400 million more than last year's balance of approximately $4.5 billion. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.56x EBITDAR. While on any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate at 34.8% was lower than last year's Q3 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned, as we had a discrete item that lowered our tax rate. And expected ongoing rate for us is approximately 36%.
Net income for the quarter was $328 million and up 6% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.4 million was down 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.77, up 12.6% over the prior year's third quarter. As Bill said in the press release this morning, the quarter was impacted by a legal charge, along with the discrete tax benefit, which netted to a reduction to earnings per share of $0.11 per share.
Now relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $516 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $113.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels or openings; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,226 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 458 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,692. We also had 25 IMC branches open at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,717.
Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $62 million; in addition, the recent quarter in line with the recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $533 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end, we had $765 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. And our leverage metric was 2.56x at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.
Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%.
Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $629,000, consistent with last year; and $633,000 last quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make the investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are very pleased to report our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 12.6% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives. And we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance at our Mega Hub has been strong and ahead of our expectations, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses.
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits.
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong earnings per share growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.
We are proud of our results this past quarter, but we are capable of doing better. We have a lot of work in front of us, but the future looks bright.

We are using -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about 700 stores that are using and selling IMC parts. That is just to supplement our commercial offerings. It's not going to be a radical change in the sales trajectory of our commercial business, but it's a nice way to say, ""Yes, we've got it"", to a commercial customer who has a unique need."

If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2016 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continued growing our business on many fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2016, with the opening of another 156 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 7.1% for the year with 249 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 83% of our domestic stores, having opened 969 net new programs in just the past 3 years. 
And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 430 -- 483rd store. We didn't open any additional stores in Brazil this quarter and opened one for the year, ending the year with 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 6 new IMC branches during the year with one opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to see significant opportunities to open new stores and commercial programs in all of the geographies where we operate. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores. 
While the domestic business dominate our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. for many years to come. I would expect the international mix of our business to only grow from here. In 2016, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com website as well as on AutoAnything. 
Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY operation for millions are our #1 priority. Our DIY business continues to growth and remains the largest portion of our sales. Also, DIY continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see opportunities for new store growth and improve productivity in our existing stores, which positions us well in this business for years to come. 
As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. This past year, we opened 6 additional hub locations and expanded our Mega Hub count to 11, increasing by 6 for the year. We've also considered to expand our multiple frequency of deliveries from our DCs to over 1,900 stores. And we are continuing with our new distribution center strategy with an expectation of having 2 new domestic DCs open over the next 3 years. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later. 
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service to our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our national sales meeting in Memphis next week will be entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service while focusing on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. Like everything in AutoZone, our pledge starts with putting customers first, and we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult their request. 
Last year, we made the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme a key priority. For 2016, we focused on literally getting the merchandise SKUs into our network of DCs, Mega Hubs, stores. This year is different and requires a different message because we have more ways to solve our customers' desires than ever before. This year is about ensuring our store AutoZoners are able to utilize these significantly enhanced availability and close the sale. 
It is also surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day, not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. 
Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities: multiple frequency of delivery is focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores; and the Mega Hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available before. We tested these 2 enhancements for a few years before beginning our implementation. In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the Mega Hubs success because we would have had to order these parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. 
The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to a different store. We've been very pleased with the implementation of both of these initiatives to date, but we are still working on methods to quantify their exact benefits as it is not lost on us that it's hard to see the benefits showing up in our 1% domestic same-store sales increase. However, we are confident that we are providing better customer service and our in-stock positions are noticeably higher. Additionally, as is our custom, we are studying our performance on various elements. And as we complete these reviews, we are optimistic we will find optimization opportunities to enhance our performance even further. 
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we implemented this enhanced service in roughly 1,000 additional stores during fiscal 2016 and now have over 1,900 of our nearly 5300 domestic stores receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3 times per week. Some stores are receiving more weekly deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determined need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every date can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize, this was up from the usual once a week delivery schedules we've historically run. 
With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns are at a relatively low rate, around 1.4 times per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out of stocks. It is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere. 
Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 1,000 stores. We are targeting to have around 3,000 stores receiving this level of service by the end of fiscal 2017. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017. 
The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hub store concept. With 11 now open, we'll open and/or expand another handful of Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. At the end of the year, we had over 3,000 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. Now not all of these 3,000 stores were having Mega Hub SKUs delivered same day. A majority of these stores receive overnight deliveries from Mega Hub locations and will continue until we open more Mega Hubs. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 Mega Hubs once the implementation is complete. 
While there was incremental cost to these rollouts and payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increase market share. Our assumption for this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017. 
In order to support more frequent deliveries to all new stores as well as the Mega Hubs, we are moving forward on our planned openings of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next few years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million, and those expenses began to flow in a small way in our CapEx spend in 2016. 2017 will have a more substantial amount of that spending. We don't expect any distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early 2018. 
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 3.3%. Our domestic same store sales were up 1%. This quarter, sales results were stronger at the end of the quarter. While every month had positive comp performance, it was clear to us that the lingering effects of last year's mild winter hampered our growth, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. We highlighted on our last quarter's call our belief that a hot summer could also offset the mild winter. Clearly later in the quarter, the heat helped as our heat-related categories performed well for the quarter, but we weren't able to completely offset the mild winter's effects. 
Last year, we mentioned a roughly 500 basis point spread in store results between the Northeast and Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets and the rest of the chain. While it was less than 500 basis points this quarter, it was still over 400 basis points. At the end of the quarter, the spread tightened a bit. However, our expectation is that this overhang will persist until we get a robust winter weather pattern again. 
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise categories:, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business. This was usual for this time of year. Again all categories were positive, but their performance was significant -- was a significantly -- was significantly different based on regionality. While our ticket was positive for DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result. 
We opened 116 [ph] net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 134 programs last year. For the year, we opened 249 net programs, reaching 83% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 7.1% on the year in commercial, our programs opened grew by 6%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong. 
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets, we opened 4 Mega Hub locations during the quarter. Over time, we expect to open more hubs and Mega Hubs in order to provide more inventory closer to our customers. 
Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 stores this quarter and now have 483 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong year. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 9% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on fiscal year-end rates. Additionally, we are in the final stages of building our second distribution center in Mexico, and it is scheduled to begin servicing stores in the first quarter of 2017. 
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4.3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. While we are excited about our online sales opportunities and growth potential, we believe expectations for our space to experience growth like in other merchandise categories is not likely. We recognize the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important, and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform. 
With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding transfer our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. 
Regarding our expectation for 2017, our first and second quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond this past year, we believe we should improve in these regions. 
As our history has showed, we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent, strong performance and extending our streak of 40 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiative, our expanding Mega Hubs and the opening of new DCs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin. 
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four,  improving inventory availability; and five, ""Yes! We've Got It."". 
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners, increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. 
In regards to commercial, we opened 116 [ph] net new programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 249 net new programs versus 296 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 to 250 programs in 2017. While our commercial sales results were below our expectations this year, the entire industry sales were below our expectations. In previous years, we saw the commercial business grow for our industry in the low- to mid-single-digit range, while we grew it double digits. It appears to us the industry, predominantly from the impact of a mild winter in the northern part of the country, grew at a much slower rate in 2016. While our sales growth rates slowed versus last year's pace, the industry saw a similar slowdown in growth. 
Our data shows we again saw our sales gaining share this past quarter. Regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive and making additional resources -- adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiatives. 
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2016 at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. 
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. 2016 was not an easy year. While our industry's performance was volatile, we asked our organization to accomplish a tremendous amount. Even with our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we were ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. 2017 will be no different. We are looking forward to an even better 2017 because of our AutoZoners' efforts in 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?"

To start this morning way, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes the domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.3%. 
Let me touch on domestic macro trends for a second. During the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.22 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.24 a gallon, a $0.02 increase. last year, gas prices decreased $0.18 per gallon for the fourth quarter, starting at $2.69 and ending at $2.51 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. 
We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2% in May and 3.2% in June, and we don't have July or August data yet. But here today through June, miles driven were up 3.3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time. 
And the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. 
For the trailing 52 weeks , total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 116 net new programs versus 134 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,390 stores supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 22% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. However, we focused on a more deliberate opening schedule starting this past year. We feel openings in the range of 200 to 250 is more realistic for our future growth. Not only is it easier to hire and staff, but also allows us to ability to devote resources to our existing programs. 
During fiscal 2016, our sales growth in commercial decelerated. Some, but certainly not all of a deceleration, was due to fewer new programs going through the maturation cycle. Our growth was also negatively impacted by what we perceived to be an overall industry slowdown in commercial particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets. As we exited 2016, our trends had accelerated modestly which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and have a much stronger engagement of our store management teams particularly the store managers and District managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. 
I complete my comments here by saying we feel 2017 should be better sales growth year than 2016. This belief is based on all the initiatives we have in place. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter and 42 for the full year. We currently have 483 stores in Mexico Mexican. This upcoming year we expect to open a similar 40 new stores, and we are on target to open our new distribution center in October. This will be our second DC in the country, and it will support Central Mexico store growth. 
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation in peso is much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. EBITDA dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's exchange rate was meaningful, a $10 million impact to EBIT. We feel the Mexico leadership team did an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business. 
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have challenged, like with Mexico, by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars. 
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,399,000,000 an increase of 3.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were up 1% for the quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 30 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the current year initiatives. 
In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. 
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses. Our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate, and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cost. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. 
SG&A for the quarter was 32.1% of sales, lower by 5 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales benefited from the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal costs, which was partially offset by our continued investment in store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. 
EBIT for the quarter was $703 million, up 5.1% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $45.8 million compared with $47.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,924,000,000 or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,625,000,000. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While at any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
For the quarter, our tax rate was 35.1% versus last year's Q4 of 35.5%. The deviation in results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose. 
Net income for the quarter was $427 million, up 6.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.8 million was down 5.2% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 12.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter. 
Relating to the cash flow statement. For the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $530 million of operating cash flow. fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $189 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 99 new locations this quarter along with capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of our new stores for upcoming quarters and development of our Mexico DC. Some investments in our domestic DC is information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2016, our CapEx was approximately $489 million. 
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,297 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 483 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil; for a total AutoZone store count of 5,788. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,814. 
Depreciation totaled $94 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $87 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. 
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $370 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $395 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year-end. Additionally, this morning, we increased our authorization an additional $750 million, taking our total authorization outstanding to $1,145,000,000. Again I want to stress we manage TO appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria.  We continue to be view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. 
Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112.8%. 
Next, we'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.1% over the same period last year driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $625,000 versus $610,000 last year and $629,000 just last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $80,000 versus a negative $79,000 last year and a negative $69,000 this past quarter. 
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns with significantly exceed our cost of capital. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 40th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and for the year, to report an EPS growth rate of 13%. We are also quite pleased with all we accomplished during 2016. While we experienced more regional sales differences than either planned or usual, our company executed exceptionally well. 
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. 
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2016. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.6 billion this past year, and we grew same-store sales at 2.4%. And we continued with our double-digit EPS growth streak, reaching our 40th consecutive quarter. 
We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well, in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We continued with our IMC integration, opened 6 new branches and have 26 in total. 
Our inventory availability rollouts continued on plan. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on these projects contributed. 
And lastly we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. at the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectations. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortments and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. 
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rates, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market condition and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. 
With 2016 behind us now, we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 84,000 AutoZoners, will do a fantastic job in 2017.

To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2016 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continued growing our business on many fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2016 with the opening of another 156 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 7.1% for the year, with 249 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 83% of our domestic stores having opened 969 net new programs in just the past 3 years. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 430 -- 483rd store. We didn't open any additional stores in Brazil this quarter and opened 1 for the year, ending the year with 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 6 new IMC branches during the year, with 1 opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to see significant opportunities to open new stores and commercial programs in all of the geographies where we operate. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the U.S. for many years to come. I would expect the international mix of our business to only grow from here. In 2016, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites as well as on AutoAnything.
Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY operations remains our #1 priority. Our DIY business continues to grow and remains the largest portion of our sales. Also, DIY continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores, which positions us well in this business for years to come.
As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. This past year, we opened 6 additional hub locations and expanded our mega hub count to 11, increasing by 6 for the year. We've also continued to expand our multiple frequency of deliveries from our DCs to over 1,900 stores. And we are continuing with our new distribution center strategy with an expectation of having 2 new domestic DCs open over the next 3 years. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our national sales meeting in Memphis next week will be entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service while focusing on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. Like everything in AutoZone, our pledge starts with putting customers first, and we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult their request.
Last year, we made the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme a key priority. For 2016, we focused on literally getting the merchandise SKUs into our network of DCs, mega hubs, hubs and stores. This year is different and requires a different message because we have more ways to solve our customers' desires than ever before. This year is about ensuring our store AutoZoners are able to utilize the significantly enhanced availability and close the sale.
It is also surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day, not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available before. We tested these 2 enhancements for a couple of years before beginning our implementation. In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hubs' success because we would have had to order these parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically.
The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to a different store. We've been very pleased with the implementation of both of these initiatives to date, but we are still working on methods to quantify their exact benefits as it is not lost on us that it's hard to see the benefits showing up in our 1% domestic same-store sales increase. However, we are confident that we are providing better customer service and our in-stock positions are noticeably higher. Additionally, as is our custom, we are studying our performance on various elements. And as we complete these reviews, we are optimistic we will find optimization opportunities to enhance our performance even further.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 1,000 additional stores during fiscal 2016 and now have over 1,900 of our nearly 5,300 domestic stores receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3 times per week. Some stores receive more weekly deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every date can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize, this was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we've historically run.
With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns are at a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out of stocks. It is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere.
Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 1,000 stores. We are targeting to have around 3,000 stores receiving this level of service by the end of fiscal 2017. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. With 11 now open, we'll open and/or expand another handful of mega hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results, thus far, in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. At the end of the year, we had over 3,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. Now not all of these 3,000 stores were having mega hub SKUs delivered same day. A majority of these stores received overnight deliveries from mega hub locations and will continue until we open more mega hubs. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete.
While there was incremental cost to these rollouts and payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our assumption for this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to all new -- to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we are moving forward on our planned openings of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next few years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million, and those expenses began to flow in a small way in our CapEx spend in 2016. 2017 will have a more substantial amount of the spending. We don't expect any distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early 2018.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 3.3%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. This quarter, sales results were stronger at the end of the quarter. While every month had positive comp performance, it was clear to us that the lingering effects of last year's mild winter hampered our growth, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. We highlighted on last quarter's call our belief that a hot summer could offset the mild winter. Clearly, later in the quarter, the heat helped as our heat-related categories performed well for the quarter, but we weren't able to completely offset the mild winter's effects.
Last year, we mentioned a roughly 500 basis point spread in comp store results between the Northeast and Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets and the rest of the chain. While it was less than 500 basis points this quarter, it was still over 400 basis points. At the end of the quarter, the spread tightened a bit. However, our expectation is that this overhang will persist until we get a robust winter weather pattern again.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business. This was usual for this time of year. Again, all categories were positive, but their performance was significantly different based on regionality. While our ticket was positive for DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result.
We opened 116 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 134 programs last year. For the year, we opened 249 net programs, reaching 83% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 7.1% on the year in commercial, our programs opened grew by 6%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets, we opened 4 mega hub locations during the quarter. Over time, we expect to open more hubs and mega hubs in order to provide more inventory closer to our customers.
Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 stores this quarter and now have 483 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong year. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 9% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on fiscal year-end rates. Additionally, we are in the final stages of building our second distribution center in Mexico, and it is scheduled to begin servicing stores in the first quarter of 2017.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4.3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. While we are excited about our online sales opportunities and growth potential, we believe expectations for our space to experience growth like in other merchandise categories is not likely. We recognize the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do the repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important, and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform.
With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding transfer our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging.
Regarding our expectations for 2017, our first and second quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond this past year, we believe we should improve in these regions.
As our history has shown, we managed this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent, strong performance and extending our streak of 40 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiative, our expanding mega hubs and the opening of new DCs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, improving inventory availability; and five, ""Yes! We've Got It.""
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners, increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.
In regards to commercial, we opened 116 net new programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 249 net new programs versus 296 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 to 250 programs in 2017. While our commercial sales results were below our expectations this year, the entire industry sales were below our expectations. In previous years, we saw the commercial business grow for our industry in the low to mid-single-digit range, while we grew it double digits. It appears to us the industry, predominantly from the impact of a mild winter in the northern part of the country, grew at a much slower rate in 2016. While our sales growth rates slowed versus last year's pace, the industry saw a similar slowdown in growth.
Our data shows we again saw our sales gaining share this past quarter. Regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in making additional resources -- adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiatives.
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2016 at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. 2016 was not an easy year. While our industry's performance was volatile, we asked our organization to accomplish a tremendous amount. Even with our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we were ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. 2017 will be no different. We are looking forward to an even better 2017 because of our AutoZoners' efforts in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?"
25307,379324787,1049828,"AutoZone, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2016",2016-09-22,"Earnings Calls","AutoZone, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes the domestic retail and co",1677,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes the domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.3%.
Let me touch on domestic macro trends for a second. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.22 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.24 a gallon, a $0.02 increase. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.18 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $2.69 and ending at $2.51 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old. The current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2% in May and 3.2% in June, and we don't have July or August data yet. But year-to-date through June, miles driven were up 3.3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.
And the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.
For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 116 net new programs versus 134 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,390 stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 22% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. However, we focused on a more deliberate opening schedule starting this past year. We feel openings in the range of 200 to 250 is more realistic for our future growth. Not only is it easier to hire and staff but also allows us the ability to devote resources to our existing programs.
During fiscal 2016, our sales growth in commercial decelerated. Some but certainly not all of the deceleration was due to fewer new programs going through the maturation cycle. Our growth was also negatively impacted by what we perceived to be an overall industry slowdown in commercial, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. As we exited 2016, our trends had accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers.
I complete my comments here by saying we feel 2017 should be better sales growth year than 2016. This belief is based on all the initiatives we have in place. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter and 42 for the full year. We currently have 483 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open a similar 40 new stores, and we are on target to open our new distribution center in October. This will be our second DC in the country, and it will support Central Mexico's store growth.
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of peso is much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. If EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate was meaningful, it's $10 million impact to EBIT. We feel the Mexico leadership team did an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business.
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged, like with Mexico, by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,399,000,000, an increase of 3.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were up 1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 30 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the current year initiatives.
In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses. But our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate, and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cost. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.
SG&A for the quarter was 32.1% of sales, lower by 5 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales benefited from the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal costs, which was partially offset by our continued investment in store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $703 million, up 5.1% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%.
Interest expense for the quarter was $45.8 million compared with $47.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,924,000,000 or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,625,000,000. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 35.1% versus last year's Q4 of 35.5%. The deviation in results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.
Net income for the quarter was $427 million, up 6.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.8 million was down 5.2% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 12.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter.
Relating to the cash flow statement, for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $530 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $189 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 99 new locations this quarter, along with capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of our new stores for upcoming quarters and development of our new Mexico DC. Some investments in our new domestic DC is information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2016, our CapEx was approximately $489 million.
With the new stores opened, we've finished this past quarter with 5,297 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 483 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil; for a total AutoZone store count of 5,788. We also had 26 IMC branches opened at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,814. 
Depreciation totaled $94 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $87 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates.
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $370 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $395 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year-end. Additionally, this morning, we increased our authorization, an additional $750 million, taking our total authorization outstanding to $1,145,000,000. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112.8%. 
Next, we'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.1% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $625,000 versus $610,000 last year and $629,000 just last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $80,000 versus a negative $79,000 last year and a negative $69,000 this past quarter. 
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 40th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and for the year, to report an EPS growth rate of 13%. We are also quite pleased with all we accomplished during 2016. While we experienced more regional sales differences than either planned or usual, our company executed exceptionally well.
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2016. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.6 billion this past year, and we grew same-store sales at 2.4%. And we continued with our double-digit EPS growth streak, reaching our 40th consecutive quarter. 
We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well, in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We continued with our IMC integration, opened 6 new branches and now have 26 in total. Our inventory availability rollouts continued on plan. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on these project has contributed. 
And lastly we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectations. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. 
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. 
With 2016 behind us now, we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 84,000 AutoZoners, will do a fantastic job in 2017.

We're going back to the drawing board and reassess in everything we can to make sure that we optimize those resources.

But from our perspective, we provide trustworthy advice at the counter for the customer. We also provide an ability for us maybe to replace wiper blades or install batteries, et cetera, so there's a service element that takes place at the store as well. So there's a value proposition that takes place in the store that's different than anything you're going to receive online. You've got somebody you can talk to. You've got information, repair information, that can be printed out and provided to you. You've got somebody who can walk out to your car and look at it and help you assess what it is you want to accomplish. So in addition to that, there's cores attached to many of the products that we sell, which create 2-way transaction. So there's all sorts of elements that, from our perspective, we provide a great value proposition. And I know there's a discrepancy in the pricing that you're going to see online versus what you get in the stores, and that's all part of the equation. So we think, from a long-term perspective, that we're all going to be cognizant of those price discrepancies, but we'll also make sure that we continue to a value proposition that warrants it."

As you look at Q1 and Q2 last year, we're comping against more difficult comparisons. We do believe that the weather implications or weather impact is going to continue to be a bit of a headwind.

To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2016 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continued growing our business on many fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2016 with the opening of another 156 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 7.1% for the year, with 249 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 83% of our domestic stores having opened 969 net new programs in just the past 3 years. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 430 -- 483rd store. We didn't open any additional stores in Brazil this quarter and opened 1 for the year, ending the year with 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 6 new IMC branches during the year, with 1 opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to see significant opportunities to open new stores and commercial programs in all of the geographies where we operate. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. for many years to come. I would expect the international mix of our business to only grow from here. In 2016, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites as well as on AutoAnything.
Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY operations remains our #1 priority. Our DIY business continues to grow and remains the largest portion of our sales. Also, DIY continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores, which positions us well in this business for years to come.
As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. This past year, we opened 6 additional hub locations and expanded our mega hub count to 11, increasing by 6 for the year. We've also continued to expand our multiple frequency of deliveries from our DCs to over 1,900 stores. And we are continuing with our new distribution center strategy with an expectation of having 2 new domestic DCs open over the next 3 years. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our national sales meeting in Memphis next week will be entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service while focusing on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. Like everything at AutoZone, our pledge starts with putting customers first, and we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request.
Last year, we made the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme a key priority. For 2016, we focused on literally getting the merchandise SKUs into our network of DCs, mega hubs, hubs and stores. This year is different and requires a different message because we have more ways to solve our customers' desires than ever before. This year is about ensuring our store AutoZoners are able to utilize the significantly enhanced availability and close the sale.
It is also surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day, not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available before. We tested these 2 enhancements for a couple of years before beginning our implementation. In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hubs' success because we would have had to order these parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically.
The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to a different store. We've been very pleased with the implementation of both of these initiatives to date, but we are still working on methods to quantify their exact benefits as it is not lost on us that it's hard to see the benefits showing up in our 1% domestic same-store sales increase. However, we are confident that we are providing better customer service and our in-stock positions are noticeably higher. Additionally, as is our custom, we are studying our performance on various elements. And as we complete these reviews, we are optimistic we will find optimization opportunities to enhance our performance even further.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 1,000 additional stores during fiscal 2016 and now have over 1,900 of our nearly 5,300 domestic stores receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3 times per week. Some stores receive more weekly deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize, this was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we've historically run.
With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out of stocks. It is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere.
Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 1,000 stores. We are targeting to have around 3,000 stores receiving this level of service by the end of fiscal 2017. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. With 11 now open, we'll open and/or expand another handful of mega hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results, thus far, in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. At the end of the year, we had over 3,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. Now not all of these 3,000 stores were having mega hub SKUs delivered same day. A majority of these stores received overnight deliveries from mega hub locations and will continue until we open more mega hubs. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete.
While there was incremental cost to these rollouts and payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our assumption for this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to all new -- to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we are moving forward on our planned openings of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next few years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million, and those expenses began to flow in a small way in our CapEx spend in 2016. 2017 will have a more substantial amount of the spending. We don't expect any distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early 2018.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 3.3%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. This quarter, sales results were stronger at the end of the quarter. While every month had positive comp performance, it was clear to us that the lingering effects of last year's mild winter hampered our growth, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. We highlighted on last quarter's call our belief that a hot summer could offset the mild winter. Clearly, later in the quarter, the heat helped as our heat-related categories performed well for the quarter, but we weren't able to completely offset the mild winter's effects.
Last year, we mentioned a roughly 500 basis point spread in comp store results between the Northeast, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets and the rest of the chain. While it was less than 500 basis points this quarter, it was still over 400 basis points. At the end of the quarter, the spread tightened a bit. However, our expectation is that this overhang will persist until we get a robust winter weather pattern again.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business. This was usual for this time of year. Again, all categories were positive, but their performance was significantly different based on regionality. While our ticket was positive for DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result.
We opened 116 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 134 programs last year. For the year, we opened 249 net programs, reaching 83% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 7.1% on the year in commercial, our programs open grew by 6%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets, we opened 4 mega hub locations during the quarter. Over time, we expect to open more hubs and mega hubs in order to provide more inventory closer to our customers.
Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 stores this quarter and now have 483 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong year. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 9% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on fiscal year-end rates. Additionally, we are in the final stages of building our second distribution center in Mexico, and it is scheduled to begin servicing stores in the first quarter of 2017.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4.3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. While we are excited about our online sales opportunities and growth potential, we believe expectations for our space to experience growth like in other merchandise categories is not likely. We recognize the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do the repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important, and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform.
With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding transfer our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging.
Regarding our expectations for 2017, our first and second quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond this past year, we believe we should improve in these regions.
As our history has shown, we managed this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent, strong performance and extending our streak of 40 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiative, our expanding mega hubs and the opening of new DCs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, improving inventory availability; and five, ""Yes! We've Got It.""
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners, increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.
In regards to commercial, we opened 116 net new programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 249 net new programs versus 296 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 to 250 programs in 2017. While our commercial sales results were below our expectations this year, the entire industry sales were below our expectations. In previous years, we saw the commercial business grow for our industry in the low to mid-single-digit range, while we grew it double digits. It appears to us the industry, predominantly from the impact of a mild winter in the northern part of the country, grew at a much slower rate in 2016. While our sales growth rates slowed versus last year's pace, the industry saw a similar slowdown in growth.
Our data shows we again saw our sales gaining share this past quarter. Regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in making additional resources -- adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2016 at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. 2016 was not an easy year. While our industry's performance was volatile, we asked our organization to accomplish a tremendous amount. Even with our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we were ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. 2017 will be no different. We are looking forward to an even better 2017 because of our AutoZoners' efforts in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?"
25307,379324787,1049869,"AutoZone, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2016",2016-09-22,"Earnings Calls","AutoZone, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and co",1677,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.3%.
Let me touch on domestic macro trends for a second. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.22 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.24 a gallon, a $0.02 increase. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.18 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $2.69 and ending at $2.51 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old. The current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2% in May and 3.2% in June, and we don't have July or August data yet. But year-to-date through June, miles driven were up 3.3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.
And the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.
For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 116 net new programs versus 134 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,390 stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 22% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. However, we focused on a more deliberate opening schedule starting this past year. We feel openings in the range of 200 to 250 is more realistic for future growth. Not only is it easier to hire and staff but also allows us the ability to devote resources to our existing programs.
During fiscal 2016, our sales growth in commercial decelerated. Some but certainly not all of the deceleration was due to fewer new programs going through the maturation cycle. Our growth was also negatively impacted by what we perceived to be an overall industry slowdown in commercial, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. As we exited 2016, our trends had accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers.
I complete my comments here by saying we feel 2017 should be better sales growth year than 2016. This belief is based on all the initiatives we have in place. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter and 42 for the full year. We currently have 483 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open a similar 40 new stores, and we are on target to open our new distribution center in October. This will be our second DC in the country, and it will support Central Mexico's store growth.
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. If EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate was meaningful, it's $10 million impact to EBIT. We feel the Mexico leadership team did an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business.
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged, like with Mexico, by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,399,000,000, an increase of 3.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were up 1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 30 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the current year initiatives.
In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses. But our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate, and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.
SG&A for the quarter was 32.1% of sales, lower by 5 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales benefited from favorable comparison to last year's higher legal costs, which was partially offset by our continued investment in store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $703 million, up 5.1% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%.
Interest expense for the quarter was $45.8 million compared with $47.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,924,000,000 or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,625,000,000. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 35.1% versus last year's Q4 of 35.5%. The deviation in results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.
Net income for the quarter was $427 million, up 6.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.8 million was down 5.2% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 12.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter.
Relating to the cash flow statement, for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $530 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $189 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 99 new locations this quarter, along with capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of our new stores for upcoming quarters and development of our new Mexico DC. Some investments in our new domestic DC is in information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2016, our CapEx was approximately $489 million.
With the new stores opened, we've finished this past quarter with 5,297 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 483 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil; for a total AutoZone store count of 5,788. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,814. 
Depreciation totaled $94 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $87 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates.
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $370 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $395 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year-end. Additionally, this morning, we increased our authorization, an additional $750 million, taking our total authorization outstanding to $1,145,000,000. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112.8%. 
Next, we'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.1% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $625,000 versus $610,000 last year and $629,000 just last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $80,000 versus a negative $79,000 last year and a negative $69,000 this past quarter. 
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 40th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and for the year, to report an EPS growth rate of 13%. We are also quite pleased with all we accomplished during 2016. While we experienced more regional sales differences than either planned or usual, our company executed exceptionally well.
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2016. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.6 billion this past year, and we grew same-store sales at 2.4%. And we continued with our double-digit EPS growth streak, reaching our 40th consecutive quarter. 
We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well, in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We continued with our IMC integration, opened 6 new branches and now have 26 in total. Our inventory availability rollouts continued on plan. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on these projects contributed. 
And lastly we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectations. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. 
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief in solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. 
With 2016 behind us now, we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 84,000 AutoZoners, will do a fantastic job in 2017.
Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Multiple frequency delivery, because you're talking about the randomness of demand, it's a little bit harder to evaluate that in our test stores. We've felt very good about it.

One of the things that happens in the wintertime in those regions is the snow and ice. Either we have to put salt down to take care of it, or there are snow piles that are tearing up the roads. That puts pressure on the undercar parts, think about chassis and the like, and it -- also, the salt makes things rust. And so they don't just rust that day, they rust over time, and those rusted parts have to be replaced over time. So we're very confident that we understand what the weather implications are, and we're also very confident that they kind of last until we get to another big winter cycle."

Where I would characterize multiple frequency of delivery is yes, we're trying to find the benefits in the numbers, and it's a little bit more difficult than we would like. We knew that going in.

So that helps a little bit from an inflationary perspective. On a commodity or a cost basis, we've seen very little inflation, and in fact, in some cases, deflation. So from that perspective, on an ATV, or an average transaction value, we would say that we've seen little benefit and possibly, a slight deterioration from commodity-based prices. And then that's been offset by some enhancement or increase, if you will, from technology inflation that always exists. So actually, when you think about it, over the last 3 years, our comp store sales, same with the industry, has probably not been helped by inflation.

To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2016 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continued growing our business on many fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2016 with the opening of another 156 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 7.1% for the year, with 249 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 83% of our domestic stores having opened 969 net new programs in just the past 3 years. And we continued to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 430 -- 483rd store. We didn't open any additional stores in Brazil this quarter and opened 1 for the year, ending the year with 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 6 new IMC branches during the year, with 1 opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to see significant opportunities to open new stores and commercial programs in all of the geographies where we operate. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. for many years to come. I would expect the international mix of our business to only grow from here. In 2016, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites as well as on AutoAnything.
Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY operations remains our #1 priority. Our DIY business continues to grow and remains the largest portion of our sales. Also, DIY continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores, which positions us well in this business for years to come.
As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. This past year, we opened 6 additional hub locations and expanded our mega hub count to 11, increasing by 6 for the year. We've also continued to expand our multiple frequency of deliveries from our DCs to over 1,900 stores. And we are continuing with our new distribution center strategy with an expectation of having 2 new domestic DCs open over the next 3 years. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our national sales meeting in Memphis next week will be entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service while focusing on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. Like everything at AutoZone, our pledge starts with putting customers first, and we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request.
Last year, we made the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme a key priority. For 2016, we focused on literally getting the merchandise SKUs into our network of DCs, mega hubs, hubs and stores. This year is different and requires a different message because we have more ways to solve our customers' desires than ever before. This year is about ensuring our store AutoZoners are able to utilize the significantly enhanced availability and close the sale.
It is also surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day, not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available before. We tested these 2 enhancements for a couple of years before beginning our implementation. In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hubs' success because we would have had to order these parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically.
The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to a different store. We've been very pleased with the implementation of both of these initiatives to date, but we are still working on methods to quantify their exact benefits as it is not lost on us that it's hard to see the benefits showing up in our 1% domestic same-store sales increase. However, we are confident that we are providing better customer service and our in-stock positions are noticeably higher. Additionally, as is our custom, we are studying our performance on various elements. And as we complete these reviews, we are optimistic we will find optimization opportunities to enhance our performance even further.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 1,000 additional stores during fiscal 2016 and now have over 1,900 of our nearly 5,300 domestic stores receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3 times per week. Some stores receive more weekly deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize, this was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we've historically run.
With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out of stocks. It is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere.
Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 1,000 stores. We are targeting to have around 3,000 stores receiving this level of service by the end of fiscal 2017. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. With 11 now open, we'll open and/or expand another handful of mega hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results, thus far, in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. At the end of the year, we had over 3,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. Now not all of these 3,000 stores were having mega hub SKUs delivered same day. A majority of these stores received overnight deliveries from mega hub locations and will continue until we open more mega hubs. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete.
While there was incremental cost to these rollouts and payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our assumption for this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to support more frequent deliveries to all new -- to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we are moving forward on our planned openings of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next few years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million, and those expenses began to flow in a small way in our CapEx spend in 2016. 2017 will have a more substantial amount of the spending. We don't expect any distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early 2018.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 3.3%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. This quarter, sales results were stronger at the end of the quarter. While every month had positive comp performance, it was clear to us that the lingering effects of last year's mild winter hampered our growth, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. We highlighted on last quarter's call our belief that a hot summer could offset the mild winter. Clearly, later in the quarter, the heat helped as our heat-related categories performed well for the quarter, but we weren't able to completely offset the mild winter's effects.
Last year, we mentioned a roughly 500 basis point spread in comp store results between the Northeast, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets and the rest of the chain. While it was less than 500 basis points this quarter, it was still over 400 basis points. At the end of the quarter, the spread tightened a bit. However, our expectation is that this overhang will persist until we get a robust winter weather pattern again.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business. This was usual for this time of year. Again, all categories were positive, but their performance was significantly different based on regionality. While our ticket was positive for DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result.
We opened 116 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 134 programs last year. For the year, we opened 249 net programs, reaching 83% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 7.1% on the year in commercial, our programs open grew by 6%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong.
As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets, we opened 4 mega hub locations during the quarter. Over time, we expect to open more hubs and mega hubs in order to provide more inventory closer to our customers.
Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 stores this quarter and now have 483 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong year. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 9% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on fiscal year-end rates. Additionally, we are in the final stages of building our second distribution center in Mexico, and it is scheduled to begin servicing stores in the first quarter of 2017.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4.3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. While we are excited about our online sales opportunities and growth potential, we believe expectations for our space to experience growth like in other merchandise categories is not likely. We recognize the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do the repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important, and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform.
With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding transfer our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging.
Regarding our expectations for 2017, our first and second quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond this past year, we believe we should improve in these regions.
As our history has shown, we managed this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent, strong performance and extending our streak of 40 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiative, our expanding mega hubs and the opening of new DCs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, improving inventory availability; and five, ""Yes! We've Got It.""
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners, increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.
In regards to commercial, we opened 116 net new programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 249 net new programs versus 296 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 to 250 programs in 2017. While our commercial sales results were below our expectations this year, the entire industry sales were below our expectations. In previous years, we saw the commercial business grow for our industry in the low to mid-single-digit range, while we grew it double digits. It appears to us the industry, predominantly from the impact of a mild winter in the northern part of the country, grew at a much slower rate in 2016. While our sales growth rates slowed versus last year's pace, the industry saw a similar slowdown in growth.
Our data shows we again saw our sales gaining share this past quarter. Regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in making additional resources -- adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2016 at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. 2016 was not an easy year. While our industry's performance was volatile, we asked our organization to accomplish a tremendous amount. Even with our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we were ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. 2017 will be no different. We are looking forward to an even better 2017 because of our AutoZoners' efforts in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?"
25307,379324787,1049998,"AutoZone, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2016",2016-09-22,"Earnings Calls","AutoZone, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results.

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.3%.
Let me touch on domestic macro trends for a second. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.22 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.24 a gallon, a $0.02 increase. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.18 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $2.69 and ending at $2.51 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old. The current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2% in May and 3.2% in June, and we don't have July or August data yet. But year-to-date through June, miles driven were up 3.3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.
And the other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.
For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 116 net new programs versus 134 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,390 stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 22% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. However, we focused on a more deliberate opening schedule starting this past year. We feel openings in the range of 200 to 250 is more realistic for future growth. Not only is it easier to hire and staff but also allows us the ability to devote resources to our existing programs.
During fiscal 2016, our sales growth in commercial decelerated. Some but certainly not all of the deceleration was due to fewer new programs going through the maturation cycle. Our growth was also negatively impacted by what we perceived to be an overall industry slowdown in commercial, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. As we exited 2016, our trends had accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers.
I complete my comments here by saying we feel 2017 should be better sales growth year than 2016. This belief is based on all the initiatives we have in place. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter and 42 for the full year. We currently have 483 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open a similar 40 new stores, and we are on target to open our new distribution center in October. This will be our second DC in the country, and it will support Central Mexico's store growth.
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. If EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate was meaningful, it's $10 million impact to EBIT. We feel the Mexico leadership team did an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business.
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged, like with Mexico, by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,399,000,000, an increase of 3.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were up 1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 30 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the current year initiatives.
In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses. But our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate, and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.
SG&A for the quarter was 32.1% of sales, lower by 5 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales benefited from favorable comparison to last year's higher legal costs, which was partially offset by our continued investment in store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $703 million, up 5.1% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%.
Interest expense for the quarter was $45.8 million compared with $47.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,924,000,000 or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,625,000,000. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 35.1% versus last year's Q4 of 35.5%. The deviation in results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.
Net income for the quarter was $427 million, up 6.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.8 million was down 5.2% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 12.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter.
Relating to the cash flow statement, for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $530 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $189 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 99 new locations this quarter, along with capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of our new stores for upcoming quarters and development of our new Mexico DC. Some investments in our new domestic DC is in information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2016, our CapEx was approximately $489 million.
With the new stores opened, we've finished this past quarter with 5,297 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 483 stores in Mexico; and 8 in Brazil; for a total AutoZone store count of 5,788. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,814. 
Depreciation totaled $94 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $87 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates.
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $370 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $395 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year-end. Additionally, this morning, we increased our authorization, an additional $750 million, taking our total authorization outstanding to $1,145,000,000. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112.8%. 
Next, we'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.1% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $625,000 versus $610,000 last year and $629,000 just last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $80,000 versus a negative $79,000 last year and a negative $69,000 this past quarter. 
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are also quite pleased with all we accomplished during 2016. While we experienced more regional sales differences than either planned or usual, our company executed exceptionally well.
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2016. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.6 billion this past year, and we grew same-store sales at 2.4%. And we continued with our double-digit EPS growth streak, reaching our 40th consecutive quarter. 
We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well, in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We continued with our IMC integration, opened 6 new branches and now have 26 in total. Our inventory availability rollouts continued on plan. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on these projects contributed. 
And lastly we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectations. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. 
Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief in solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. 
With 2016 behind us now, we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 84,000 AutoZoners, will do a fantastic job in 2017.

To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our company for again delivering solid results this past quarter. We continue to execute our plan and generally achieved our goals, although our sales results were below our plan.
Our domestic AutoZone business expanded, growing same-store sales 1.6% while opening another 16 new stores. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our Commercial business continued to expand with 6.3% sales growth over last year's first quarter while opening 35 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net Commercial programs this fiscal year.
At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a Commercial program. And we continue to expand in Mexico, opening 5 new stores. We didn't open any additional locations in Brazil or IMC this quarter. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone business.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. 
Regarding the Internet, we experienced a challenging quarter. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and Pickup In Store. Our Pickup In Store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category.
While our Pickup In Store business continues to thrive and it's growing rapidly, our ship-to-home businesses were softer than last year. Our objective is to provide our customers with exceptional service regardless of how they want to interact with us. And it isn't surprising to us that many of them want to research their purchases online and then purchase or pickup their products in store. This allows them to have immediate access to their purchases and affords them the opportunity to get the trustworthy advice they have come to expect from our AutoZoners.
While our sales shortfall in ship-to-home purchases is not surprising to us, we are continuing to invest in an accelerated rate to improve the online shopping experience to ensure that our customers' interactions with us through any channel are exceptional.
While our DIY operations remain our number one priority, we are focused on growing our Commercial business where our share is smaller. To this end, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we've expanded our multiple delivery frequency rollouts to an additional 161 net locations and now have approximately 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores receiving 3 or more deliveries per week from our distribution centers.
Regarding our Mega Hub rollouts, we are working diligently on the development of future sites, but we did not open any incremental locations this quarter. We continue to operate 11 Mega Hubs and expect to open several more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations.
Additionally, we are continuing to expand our distribution network. In the first quarter, we opened our second distribution center in Mexico and have 2 distribution centers under construction in the United States. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
To this end, our national sales meeting held in Memphis at the end of September was entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service with an emphasis on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. We've demonstrated our enhanced abilities to allow AutoZoners to be able to see and access inventory at their stores, nearby stores, hubs, Mega Hubs and vendor stock inventory.
We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Under the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, we are focused on improving our closure rates. It is always surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores everyday not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores and the Mega Hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available in the market before.
In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the Mega Hubs' success because we would have had to order the parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we would -- we could have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to another store.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores and these stores are receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3x a week. Some stores receive more deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine the need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize this was up from the usual once a week delivery schedules we'd historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turn is at a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of 1.
Over the next 9 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 300 stores. We have moderated our rollout pace over the remainder of the year to temper the significant change our distribution centers have to absorb and to manage our cost structure. This past quarter's deleverage was above our cost expectations. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to expand this service in those areas at lower costs. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hubs store concept. We are currently operating 11 Mega Hubs and we'll open or expand several more Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer customers.
As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice of what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.
Our sales results, thus far, in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently, we have over 3,500 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. A majority of these 3,500 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today. But as we expand our Mega Hubs, more of them will receive this service the same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.
We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 Mega Hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a Mega Hub is, on average, 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is a challenge -- is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to provide more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the Mega Hubs, we are moving forward on our planned opening of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next couple of years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million. For 2017, we will incur a majority of these 2 distribution centers' investments in our CapEx budget. However, we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018.
Now let's turn to our first quarter's results. Our sales increased 3.4%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.6%. This quarter's sales were consistent until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Our sales were challenged the week of the presidential election, which slowed our performance. We did experience positive comps in every month of the quarter. However, November's first week was challenging for us.
We also continue to see the lingering effects of last year's mild winter, hampering our growth in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter.
While we saw over a 400 basis point spread between these 3 markets and the others in the fourth quarter, the gap continued to tighten this quarter, where we saw an approximately 250 basis point spread, but in the last few weeks, that gap shrunk considerably. Our expectation is that this overhang will continue until winter weather returns.
In regard our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business' mix. This was usual for this time of year. While the failure and discretionary categories were positive for DIY, the maintenance category was slightly negative. Our results were driven really by geography.
Also, while ticket was positive for both DIY and Commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result as the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets' underperformance was traffic-driven.
We opened 35 net new Commercial programs in the quarter versus 55 net new programs in last year's first quarter. Our sales grew 6.3% on the quarter in commercial, and our programs opened grew by 5%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remained strong. Regarding Mexico, we opened 5 stores this quarter, and now have 488 total stores in Mexico. 
In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong quarter. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below the historic growth rate, given the roughly 23% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on year-over-year quarter ending rates. 
Additionally, as I said earlier, our second distribution in Mexico opened this past quarter. 
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 4.2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment. 
As I mentioned, we saw site traffic and ship-to-home sales challenged during the quarter. However, we saw strength in our pickup-in-store sales. This strength in pickup in store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pickup in store, while smaller than home delivery, is quickly catching up in sales volume. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to their purchase. 
And our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us, at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important, and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform. 
With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging for us. 
Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, our second quarter results are our most difficult comparison. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond, we believe we should improve in those regions. 
Our history has shown we manage this business focusing on both short- and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance, and we'll be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. 
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating planned theme for 2017, ""Yes! We've Got It."" The key priorities for the year Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, ""Yes! We've Got It."" and leveraging information technology. 
On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme. 
We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize that customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy. We have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. 
Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately. 
In regards to commercial, we opened 35 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs in 2017. While our sales growth rates slowed in recent quarters, the industry saw similar slowdown. Our data shows we again gained share this past quarter. 
We believe last year's mild winter continued to hamper industry sales growth as regional discrepancies played big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative. 
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our first quarter at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. 
However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. 
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to deliver on their commitments. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill Giles."

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our dome",1725,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. 
For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.7%. Switching over to macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.24 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.16 a gallon, a slight decrease. Now last year gas prices decreased $0.42 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $2.51 and ending at $2.09 a gallon. 
We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles, and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. 
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in July, 2.9% in August and 2.9% in September, and we don't have October or November data yet, but year-to-date through September, miles driven are up approximately 3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time. 
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,781,000,000 -- $1,781,000 for the quarter for the 52 weeks ended. 
Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.3%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's first quarter. This past quarter, we opened 35 net new programs versus 55 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. 
We now have our commercial program in 4,425 stores or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs. 
As we have begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. 
We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016. 
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 5 new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 488 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores. 
As Bill said earlier, we are challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the quarter but moved from materially post the U.S. election in November. 
While devaluing 23% year-over-year, it weakened 11% in just this quarter, but the majority of the decline in the quarter in the first 2 weeks of November. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. 
The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter, assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rates, was meaningful, a roughly $6 million impact to EBIT. We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business, and we continue to feel like the moves will be manageable. 
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged over time by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars. 
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total, our sales were $2,468,000,000, an increase of 3.4% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than 1 year, were up 1.6% for the quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 23 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current-year inventory initiatives. 
In regards to inflation, it was again slightly down year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. 
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate, and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries cause. We will work to diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. 
SG&A for the quarter was 34.1% of sales, lower by 1 basis point from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year as favorability across several areas was offset by higher domestic store payroll. 
We continue to believe we're well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $459 million, up 4.8% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.6%. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $33.3 million compared with $35 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,997,000,000 or $243 million more than last year's quarter balance of $4,754,000,000. 
Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade ratings and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important of that strategy. 
For the quarter, our tax rate was 34.7% versus last year's Q1 of 35.9%. The deviation of results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose. But additionally, I want to take a moment to discuss AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard has us recognizing the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L previously had flowed through stockholders' equity. 
This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 74 basis points and benefited EPS accordingly. However, this accounting change also has an effect on the diluted share count calculation, resulting in higher or more diluted share count. 
Net income for the quarter was $278.1 million, up 7.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.7 million was down 4.6% from last year's first quarter. 
The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $9.36, up 13% over the prior year's first quarter. The new accounting standard just mentioned increased our diluted share count by 226,000 shares, reducing our reported EPS by $0.08 a share. Netting the benefit in our tax rate were the impact from a higher reported diluted share count raised our EPS by $0.03 on the quarter. 
While not a large impact on the EPS, we feel it is important for investors to know how the accounting change will affect results. We'll continue to keep you abreast of any impacts going forward in future quarters. 
Relating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $407 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23  new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels and openings work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; development of our New Mexico DC; and some minor investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. 
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,313 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 488 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,809. 
We also had 26 IMC branches opened at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,835. 
Depreciation totaled $71.8 million for the quarter versus last year's fiscal quarter expense of $66.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. 
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $363 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $783 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter end. 
Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. 
We continue to view our share repurchase program is an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.3%. 
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 7.3% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $647,000 versus $624,000 last year and $625,000 just this past quarter. 
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $67,000 versus a negative $66,000 last year and negative $80,000 this past quarter. 
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 41st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, delivering an EPS growth rate of 13% this quarter. While we continue to experience more regional sales differences than usual, our company executed exceptionally well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. 
To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. 
Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. 
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting initiatives we have in store for fiscal 2017. We will continue to expand our AutoZone store footprint in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, opening approximately 200 locations combined. 
We will open roughly 200 additional Commercial programs. Our inventory availability efforts will expand with the opening of another handful of Mega Hubs and with the further expansion of multiple deliveries per week to 300 or so more stores. 
We have already opened our second distribution center in Mexico, and we have 2 domestic distribution centers currently under construction. Our investments in technology continue to accelerate with an intensified focus on our online offerings. 
And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all of our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must exceed their expectations. 
We are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new stores square footage at a low single-digit growth rates, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we'll leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. 
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. 
Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure we -- and continue to ensure we're investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. 
Now we'd like to open up the call to questions."

Actually just to level set, it's not a material amount of business being conducted from an eCommerce perspective for AutoZone overall. Secondly during the quarter, we were a little less promotional online, and we pulled back a little bit from some of our paid advertising as well. What we're more focused on is improving the experience for the customer. As Bill mentioned before, we continue to drive a lot of sales through buy online, pickup in store, and that part of the business continues to remain very strong. From a pure ship-to-home basis on both autozone.com and AutoAnything, those were a little softer during the quarter, but like I said, we've -- that we were a little less promotional during the quarter, and we're also investing some things in the platform that'll probably slow us down a little bit as we continue to migrate through that. So when you think about eCommerce, we're not immune to sales through eCommerce. But at the same time, when you think about the experience that you have walking into an AutoZone store, there's a lot of trustworthy advice that's taking place. And so when someone walks in and wants to buy a battery, which you can't buy online because you can't ship it, we'll likely test your entire starting and charging system in order to ensure that, that is the problem that you are -- that we are going to solve for you. So there's a lot of things that take place in a store between starters and alternators that are -- that have cords attached that require those products come back. There's an ability for on AutoZoner to walk out to the car and be able to assess and ensure that the consumer is getting what they need and being able to resolve their issues and being able to see the parts before they purchase it. So there's a lot of things that experience inside of a store that you can't duplicate online. Again, we're not immune to online sales, but we believe that there are a lot of attributes that make it unique inside the store, the experience inside the store."

So think about 100 per quarter for the balance of the year where we had been running at about 300 stores per quarter. So we are deliberately slowing the rollout of multiple frequency of delivery. The biggest reason that we are slowing the rollout is because we put a massive amount of change on our supply chain over the last couple of years getting to these 2,100 locations that are already on there. So just think about that. That's 4,200 incremental deliveries for our supply chain in just 2 years alone, and that has just been a massive amount of change, and we need to slow down and let them absorb that change. We're also mindful that it does impact our cost structure, and so we want to slow it down mainly for the supply chain but also to make sure that we continue to have reasonable profitability. And as we mentioned, it cost us roughly 15 basis points in the quarter, but there are other costs that aren't in that number just from the amount of change that we've had in our supply chain and those kind of things.

First of all, yes, your assessment of what would happen without the week of the elections probably pretty accurate. We were running close to 2 for the quarter. I do believe that there is still a headwind in our overall comp from the lingering effects of last year's mild winter. We said that it moderated, but we still had a 250 basis point gap between what happened in those markets and what happened in the other markets. So to do the math, if there's 250 basis points, we ran a 1.6 comp, clearly, those markets ran negative comp for the quarter. I believe just as we saw in 2012, once the effects of a cold winter hit, we will see improvements in our overall comps in those markets clearly, but I'd also want to be careful. It's not going to happen overnight, and I'll give you some examples. Last year, during this period of time in December, it was very warm, and our sales were really strong, but they weren't strong in they categories that we've traditionally sold. We were doing really well with things like under car, brakes and the like, chassis because the weather was conducive for people to do maintenance projects that they normally don't do this time of year. So we, in essence, pulled brake break business forward, and we didn't get the failure business. So we had a pretty strong Q2 last year. It was really Q3 and Q4 and now into Q1, where we saw the bigger impact from the lack of a serious winter last year. So we're excited that we're about to see the first really good cold snap of the year. We're excited to see what that will mean to us, but it'll be really Q3 before we expect to see any rebound."

Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our company for again delivering solid results this past quarter. We continue to execute our plan and generally achieved our goals, although our sales results were below our plan.
Our domestic AutoZone business expanded, growing same-store sales 1.6% while opening another 16 new stores. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our Commercial business continued to expand with 6.3% sales growth over last year's first quarter while opening 35 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net Commercial programs this fiscal year.
At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a Commercial program. And we continue to expand in Mexico, opening 5 new stores. We didn't open any additional locations in Brazil or IMC this quarter. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone business.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. 
Regarding the Internet, we experienced a challenging quarter. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and Pickup In Store. Our Pickup In Store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category.
While our Pickup In Store business continues to thrive and it's growing rapidly, our ship-to-home businesses were softer than last year. Our objective is to provide our customers with exceptional service regardless of how they want to interact with us. And it isn't surprising to us that many of them want to research their purchases online and then purchase or pickup their products in store. This allows them to have immediate access to their purchases and affords them the opportunity to get the trustworthy advice they have come to expect from our AutoZoners.
While our sales shortfall in ship-to-home purchases is not surprising to us, we are continuing to invest in an accelerated rate to improve the online shopping experience to ensure that our customers' interactions with us through any channel are exceptional.
While our DIY operations remain our number one priority, we are focused on growing our Commercial business where our share is smaller. To this end, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we've expanded our multiple delivery frequency rollouts to an additional 161 net locations and now have approximately 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores receiving 3 or more deliveries per week from our distribution centers.
Regarding our Mega Hub rollouts, we are working diligently on the development of future sites, but we did not open any incremental locations this quarter. We continue to operate 11 Mega Hubs and expect to open several more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations.
Additionally, we are continuing to expand our distribution network. In the first quarter, we opened our second distribution center in Mexico and have 2 distribution centers under construction in the United States. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
To this end, our national sales meeting held in Memphis at the end of September was entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service with an emphasis on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. We've demonstrated our enhanced abilities to allow AutoZoners to be able to see and access inventory at their stores, nearby stores, hubs, Mega Hubs and vendor stock inventory.
We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Under the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, we are focused on improving our closure rates. It is always surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores everyday not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores and the Mega Hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available in the market before.
In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the Mega Hubs' success because we would have had to order the parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we would -- we could have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to another store.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores and these stores are receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3x a week. Some stores receive more deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine the need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize this was up from the usual once a week delivery schedules we'd historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turn is at a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of 1.
Over the next 9 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 300 stores. We have moderated our rollout pace over the remainder of the year to temper the significant change our distribution centers have to absorb and to manage our cost structure. This past quarter's deleverage was above our cost expectations. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to expand this service in those areas at lower costs. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hubs store concept. We are currently operating 11 Mega Hubs and we'll open or expand several more Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer customers.
As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice of what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.
Our sales results, thus far, in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently, we have over 3,500 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. A majority of these 3,500 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today. But as we expand our Mega Hubs, more of them will receive this service the same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.
We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 Mega Hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a Mega Hub is, on average, 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is a challenge -- is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to provide more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the Mega Hubs, we are moving forward on our planned opening of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next couple of years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million. For 2017, we will incur a majority of these 2 distribution centers' investments in our CapEx budget. However, we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018.
Now let's turn to our first quarter's results. Our sales increased 3.4%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.6%. This quarter's sales were consistent until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Our sales were challenged the week of the presidential election, which slowed our performance. We did experience positive comps in every month of the quarter. However, November's first week was challenging for us.
We also continue to see the lingering effects of last year's mild winter, hampering our growth in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter.
While we saw over a 400 basis point spread between these 3 markets and the others in the fourth quarter, the gap continued to tighten this quarter, where we saw an approximately 250 basis point spread, but in the last few weeks, that gap shrunk considerably. Our expectation is that this overhang will continue until winter weather returns.
In regard our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business' mix. This was usual for this time of year. While the failure and discretionary categories were positive for DIY, the maintenance category was slightly negative. Our results were driven really by geography.
Also, while ticket was positive for both DIY and Commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result as the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets' underperformance was traffic-driven.
We opened 35 net new Commercial programs in the quarter versus 55 net new programs in last year's first quarter. Our sales grew 6.3% on the quarter in Commercial and our programs opened grew by 5%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remained strong.
Regarding Mexico, we opened 5 stores this quarter and now have 488 total stores in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong quarter. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rate, given the roughly 23% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on year-over-year quarter-ending rates. Additionally, as I said earlier, our second distribution in Mexico opened this past quarter.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 4.2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment. As I mentioned, we saw site traffic and ship-to-home sales challenged during the quarter. However, we saw strength in our Pickup In Store sales. This strength in Pickup In Store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pickup In Store, while smaller than home delivery, is quickly catching up in sales volume.
We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to their purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us, less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform.
With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices, on average, are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging for us.
Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, our second quarter results are our most difficult comparison. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond, we believe we should improve in those regions. Our history has shown we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and we'll be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating planned theme for 2017, ""Yes! We've Got It."" The key priorities for the year are Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, ""Yes! We've Got It."" and leveraging information technology.
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme.
We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately.
In regards to Commercial, we opened 35 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs in 2017. While our sales growth rates slowed in recent quarters, the industry saw a similar slowdown. Our data shows we, again, gained share this past quarter. We believe last year's mild winter continued to hamper industry sales growth as regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail.
As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative.
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our first quarter at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to deliver on their commitments. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.
Now I'll turn it over to Bill Giles."

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.7%.
Switching over to macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.24 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.16 a gallon, a slight decrease. Now, last year, gas prices decreased $0.42 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $2.51 and ending at $2.09 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices had a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and, as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in July, 2.9% in August and 2.9% in September. Now, we don't have October or November data yet, but year-to-date through September, miles driven are up approximately 3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,781,000,000 -- $1,781,000 for the quarter for the 52 weeks ended.
Now, for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.3%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's first quarter. This past quarter, we opened 35 net new programs versus 55 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,425 stores or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs.
As we have begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016.
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 5 new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 488 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores.
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by a difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year.
The peso devalued over the course of the quarter, but moved from materially post the U.S. election in November. While devaluing 23% year-over-year, it weakened 11% in just this quarter, with the majority of the decline in the quarter in the first 2 weeks of November. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter, assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate, was meaningful, a roughly $6 million impact to EBIT.
We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business and we continue to feel like the moves will be manageable.
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged over time by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total, our sales were $2,468,000,000, an increase of 3.4% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 1.6% for the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 23 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.
In regards to inflation, it was, again, slightly down year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries cause. We will work to diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.
SG&A for the quarter was 34.1% of sales, lower by 1 basis point from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year as favorability across several areas was offset by higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $459 million, up 4.8% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.3 million compared with $35 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,997,000,000 or $243 million more than last year's quarter balance of $4,754,000,000.
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 34.7% versus last year's Q1 of 35.9%. The deviation of results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.
But additionally, I want to take a moment to discuss AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard has us recognizing the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L previously had flowed through stockholders' equity. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 74 basis points and benefited EPS accordingly. However, this accounting change also has an effect on the diluted share count calculation resulting in higher or more dilutive share count.
Net income for the quarter was $278.1 million, up 7.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.7 million was down 4.6% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $9.36, up 13% over the prior year's first quarter.
The new accounting standard just mentioned increased our diluted share count by 226,000 shares, reducing our reported EPS by $0.08 a share. Netting the benefit in our tax rate were the impact from a higher reported diluted share count raised our EPS by $0.03 on the quarter.
While not a large impact on the EPS, we feel it is important for investors to know how the accounting change will affect results. We'll continue to keep you abreast of any impacts going forward in future quarters.
Relating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $407 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels and openings; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; development of our New Mexico DC; and some minor investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments.
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,313 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 488 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,809. We also had 26 IMC branches opened at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,835.
Depreciation totaled $71.8 million for the quarter versus last year's fiscal quarter expense of $66.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates.
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $363 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter-end, we had $783 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter-end.
Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria.
We continue to view our share repurchase program is an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.3%.
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 7.3% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $647,000 versus $624,000 last year and $625,000 just this past quarter.
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $67,000 versus a negative $66,000 last year and negative $80,000 this past quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 41st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, delivering an EPS growth rate of 13% this quarter. While we continue to experience more regional sales differences than usual, our company executed exceptionally well.
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting initiatives we have in store for fiscal 2017. We will continue to expand our AutoZone store footprint in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, opening approximately 200 locations combined.
We will open roughly 200 additional Commercial programs. Our inventory availability efforts will expand with the opening of another handful of Mega Hubs and with the further expansion of multiple deliveries per week to 300 or so more stores.
We have already opened our second distribution center in Mexico and we have 2 domestic distribution centers currently under construction.
Our investments in technology continue to accelerate with an intensified focus on our online offerings. 
And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all of our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations.
We are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we'll leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure we -- and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.
Now we'd like to open up the call to questions."

Secondly, during the quarter, we were a little less promotional online and we pulled back a little bit from some of our paid advertising as well.
What we're more focused on is improving the experience for the customer. And as Bill mentioned before, we continue to drive a lot of sales through buy online and Pickup In Store, and that part of the business continues to remain very strong.
From a pure ship-to-home basis on both autozone.com and AutoAnything, those were a little softer during the quarter. But like I said, we've -- that we were a little less promotional during the quarter and we're also investing some things in the platform that will probably slow us down a little bit as we continue to migrate through that.
So when you think about eCommerce, we're not immune to sales through eCommerce. But at the same time, when you think about the experience that you have walking into an AutoZone store, there's a lot of trustworthy advice that's taking place. And so when someone walks in and wants to buy a battery, which you can't buy online because you can't ship it, we'll likely test your entire starting and charging system in order to ensure that, that is the problem that you are -- we are going to solve for you. So there's a lot of things that take place in a store between starters and alternators that are -- that have cords attached that require those products to come back. There is an ability for an AutoZoner to walk out to the car and be able to assess and ensure that the consumer is getting what they need and being able to resolve their issues and being able to see the parts before they purchase it. So there's a lot of things that's experienced inside of a store that you can't duplicate online. Again, we're not immune to online sales, but we believe that there are a lot of attributes that make it unique inside the store, the experience inside the store."

So think about 100 per quarter for the balance of the year where we had been running at about 300 stores per quarter. So we are deliberately slowing the rollout of multiple frequency of delivery.
The biggest reason that we are slowing the rollout is because we put a massive amount of change on our supply chain over the last couple of years getting to these 2,100 locations that are already on there. So just think about that, that's 4,200 incremental deliveries for our supply chain in just 2 years alone. And that has just been a massive amount of change and we need to slow down and let them absorb that change.
We're also mindful that it does impact our cost structure. And so we want to slow it down mainly for the supply chain, but also to make sure that we continue to have reasonable profitability. And as we mentioned, it cost us roughly 15 basis points in the quarter, but there are other costs that aren't in that number just from the amount of change that we had in our supply chain and those kind of things.

First of all, yes, your assessment about what would happen without the week of the election is probably pretty accurate. We were running close to a 2 for the quarter. I do believe that there is still a headwind in our overall comp from the lingering effects of last year's mild winter. We said that it moderated, but we still had a 250 basis point gap between what happened in those markets and what happened in the other markets. So to do the math, if there's 250 basis points and you ran a 1.6 comp, clearly those markets ran negative comp for the quarter.
I believe, just as we saw in 2012, once the effects of a cold winter hit, we will see improvements in our overall comps in those markets clearly. But I'd also want to be careful. It's not going to happen overnight. And I'll give you some examples. Last year, during this period of time in December, it was very warm and our sales were really strong, but they weren't strong in the categories that we traditionally sold. We were doing really well with things like undercar, brakes and the like, chassis because the weather was conducive for people to do maintenance projects that they normally don't do this time of year. So we, in essence, pulled brake business forward and we didn't get the failure business. So we had a pretty strong Q2 last year. It was really Q3 and Q4 and now into Q1 where we saw the bigger impact from the lack of a serious winter last year.
So we're excited that we're about to see the first really good cold snap of the year. We're excited to see what that will mean to us, but it will be really Q3 before we expect to see any rebound."

But we recognize that, look, based on the run rate that we were going as far as the rollout, this has proven to pull back a little bit and be able to improve the efficiencies in the organization as we move through this. We're still committed to rolling it out. We're just going to roll a few less as we move forward.

At the moment, many people come to the website to gain information before shopping at the store. So that -- what we're looking for is to ensure that we've got a great shopping experience in all different channels that the customer is coming to.

If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our company for again delivering solid results this past quarter. We continue to execute our plan and generally achieved our goals, although our sales results were below our plan.
Our domestic AutoZone business expanded, growing same-store sales 1.6% while opening another 16 new stores. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our Commercial business continued to expand with 6.3% sales growth over last year's first quarter while opening 35 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net Commercial programs this fiscal year.
At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a Commercial program. And we continue to expand in Mexico, opening 5 new stores. We didn't open any additional locations in Brazil or IMC this quarter. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone business.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. 
Regarding the Internet, we experienced a challenging quarter. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and Pickup In Store. Our Pickup In Store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category.
While our Pickup In Store business continues to thrive and it's growing rapidly, our ship-to-home businesses were softer than last year. Our objective is to provide our customers with exceptional service regardless of how they want to interact with us. And it isn't surprising to us that many of them want to research their purchases online and then purchase or pickup their products in store. This allows them to have immediate access to their purchases and affords them the opportunity to get the trustworthy advice they have come to expect from our AutoZoners.
While our sales shortfall in ship-to-home purchases is not surprising to us, we're continuing to invest in an accelerated rate to improve the online shopping experience to ensure that our customers' interactions with us through any channel are exceptional.
While our DIY operations remain our #1 priority, we are focused on growing our Commercial business where our share is smaller. To this end, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we've expanded our multiple delivery frequency rollouts to an additional 161 net locations and now have approximately 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores receiving 3 or more deliveries per week from our distribution centers.
Regarding our Mega Hub rollouts, we are working diligently on the development of future sites, but we did not open any incremental locations this quarter. We continue to operate 11 Mega Hubs and expect to open several more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations.
Additionally, we are continuing to expand our distribution network. In the first quarter, we opened our second distribution center in Mexico and have 2 distribution centers under construction in the United States. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
To this end, our national sales meeting held in Memphis at the end of September was entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service with an emphasis on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. We've demonstrated our enhanced abilities to allow AutoZoners to be able to see and access inventory at their stores, nearby stores, hubs, Mega Hubs and vendor stock inventory.
We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Under the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, we are focused on improving our closure rates. It is always surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores everyday not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores and the Mega Hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available in the market before.
In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the Mega Hubs' success because we would have had to order the parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we would -- we could have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to another store.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores and these stores are receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3x a week. Some stores receive more deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine the need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize this was up from the usual once a week delivery schedules we'd historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turn is at a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of 1.
Over the next 9 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 300 stores. We have moderated our rollout pace over the remainder of the year to temper the significant change our distribution centers have to absorb and to manage our cost structure. This past quarter's deleverage was above our cost expectations. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to expand this service in those areas at lower cost. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hubs store concept. We are currently operating 11 Mega Hubs and we'll open or expand several more Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer customers.
As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.
Our sales results, thus far, in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently, we have over 3,500 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. A majority of these 3,500 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today. But as we expand our Mega Hubs, more of them will receive this service the same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.
We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 Mega Hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a Mega Hub is, on average, 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is a challenge -- is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to provide more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the Mega Hubs, we are moving forward on our planned opening of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next couple of years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million. For 2017, we will incur a majority of these 2 distribution centers' investments in our CapEx budget. However, we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018.
Now let's turn to our first quarter's results. Our sales increased 3.4%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.6%. This quarter's sales were consistent until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Our sales were challenged the week of the presidential election, which slowed our performance. We did experience positive comps in every month of the quarter. However, November's first week was challenging for us.
We also continue to see the lingering effects of last year's mild winter, hampering our growth in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter.
While we saw over a 400 basis point spread between these 3 markets and the others in the fourth quarter, the gap continued to tighten this quarter, where we saw an approximately 250 basis point spread, but in the last few weeks, that gap shrunk considerably. Our expectation is that this overhang will continue until winter weather returns.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business' mix. This was usual for this time of year. While the failure and discretionary categories were positive for DIY, the maintenance category was slightly negative. Our results were driven really by geography.
Also, while ticket was positive for both DIY and Commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result as the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets' underperformance was traffic-driven.
We opened 35 net new Commercial programs in the quarter versus 55 net new programs in last year's first quarter. Our sales grew 6.3% on the quarter in Commercial and our programs opened grew by 5%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remained strong.
Regarding Mexico, we opened 5 stores this quarter and now have 488 total stores in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong quarter. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rate, given the roughly 23% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on year-over-year quarter-ending rates. Additionally, as I said earlier, our second distribution in Mexico opened this past quarter.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 4.2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment. As I mentioned, we saw site traffic and ship-to-home sales challenged during the quarter. However, we saw strength in our Pickup In Store sales. This strength in Pickup In Store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pickup In Store, while smaller than home delivery, is quickly catching up in sales volume.
We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to their purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform.
With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices, on average, are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging for us.
Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, our second quarter results are our most difficult comparison. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond, we believe we should improve in those regions. Our history has shown we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and we'll be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating planned theme for 2017, ""Yes! We've Got It."" The key priorities for the year are Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, ""Yes! We've Got It."" and leveraging information technology.
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme.
We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately.
In regards to Commercial, we opened 35 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs in 2017. While our sales growth rates slowed in recent quarters, the industry saw a similar slowdown. Our data shows we again gained share this past quarter. We believe last year's mild winter continued to hamper industry sales growth as regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail.
As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative.
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our first quarter at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to deliver on their commitments. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.
Now I'll turn it over to Bill Giles."
25307,407661799,1097726,"AutoZone, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 06, 2016",2016-12-06,"Earnings Calls","AutoZone, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domes",1729,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.
To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.7%.
Switching over to macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.24 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.16 a gallon, a slight decrease. Now, last year, gas prices decreased $0.42 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $2.51 and ending at $2.09 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and, as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in July, 2.9% in August and 2.9% in September. Now, we don't have October or November data yet, but year-to-date through September, miles driven are up approximately 3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,781,000,000 -- $1,781,000 for the quarter -- for the 52 weeks ended.
Now, for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.3%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's first quarter. This past quarter, we opened 35 net new programs versus 55 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,425 stores or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs.
As we have begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016.
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 5 new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 488 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores.
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by a difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year.
The peso devalued over the course of the quarter, but moved from materially post the U.S. election in November. While devaluing 23% year-over-year, it weakened 11% in just this quarter, with the majority of the decline in the quarter in the first 2 weeks of November. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter, assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate, was meaningful, a roughly $6 million impact to EBIT.
We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business and we continue to feel like the moves will be manageable.
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged over time by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total, our sales were $2,468,000,000, an increase of 3.4% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 1.6% for the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 23 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.
In regards to inflation, it was, again, slightly down year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries costs. We will work to diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.
SG&A for the quarter was 34.1% of sales, lower by 1 basis point from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year as favorability across several areas was offset by higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $459 million, up 4.8% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.3 million compared with $35 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,997,000,000 or $243 million more than last year's quarter balance of $4,754,000,000.
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 34.7% versus last year's Q1 of 35.9%. The deviation of results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.
But additionally, I want to take a moment to discuss AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard has us recognizing the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L previously had flowed through stockholders' equity. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 74 basis points and benefited EPS accordingly. However, this accounting change also has an effect on the diluted share count calculation resulting in higher or more dilutive share count.
Net income for the quarter was $278.1 million, up 7.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.7 million was down 4.6% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $9.36, up 13% over the prior year's first quarter.
The new accounting standard just mentioned increased our diluted share count by 226,000 shares, reducing our reported EPS by $0.08 a share. Netting the benefit in our tax rate were the impact from a higher reported diluted share count raised our EPS by $0.03 on the quarter.
While not a large impact on the EPS, we feel it is important for investors to know how the accounting change will affect results. We'll continue to keep you abreast of any impacts going forward in future quarters.
Relating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $407 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels and openings; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; development of our New Mexico DC; and some minor investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments.
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,313 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 488 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,809. We also had 26 IMC branches opened at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,835.
Depreciation totaled $71.8 million for the quarter versus last year's fiscal quarter expense of $66.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates.
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $363 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter-end, we had $783 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter-end.
Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria.
We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.3%.
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 7.3% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $647,000 versus $624,000 last year and $625,000 just this past quarter.
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $67,000 versus a negative $66,000 last year and negative $80,000 this past quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 41st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, delivering an EPS growth rate of 13% this quarter. While we continue to experience more regional sales differences than usual, our company executed exceptionally well.
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting initiatives we have in store for fiscal 2017. We will continue to expand our AutoZone store footprint in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, opening approximately 200 locations combined.
We will open roughly 200 additional Commercial programs. Our inventory availability efforts will expand with the opening of another handful of Mega Hubs and with the further expansion of multiple deliveries per week to 300 or so more stores.
We have already opened our second distribution center in Mexico and we have 2 domestic distribution centers currently under construction.
Our investments in technology continue to accelerate with an intensified focus on our online offerings. 
And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all of our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations.
We are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we'll leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure we -- and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.

Secondly, during the quarter, we were a little less promotional online and we pulled back a little bit from some of our paid advertising as well.
What we're more focused on is improving the experience for the customer. And as Bill mentioned before, we continue to drive a lot of sales through buy online and Pickup In Store, and that part of the business continues to remain very strong.
From a pure ship-to-home basis on both autozone.com and AutoAnything, those were a little softer during the quarter. But like I said, we've -- that we were a little less promotional during the quarter and we're also investing some things in the platform that will probably slow us down a little bit as we continue to migrate through that.
So when you think about eCommerce, we're not immune to sales through eCommerce. But at the same time, when you think about the experience that you have walking into an AutoZone store, there's a lot of trustworthy advice that's taking place. And so when someone walks in and wants to buy a battery, which you can't buy online because you can't ship it, we'll likely test your entire starting and charging system in order to ensure that, that is the problem that you are -- we are going to solve for you. So there's a lot of things that take place in a store between starters and alternators that are -- that have cores attached that require those products to come back. There is an ability for an AutoZoner to walk out to the car and be able to assess and ensure that the customer is getting what they need and being able to resolve their issues and being able to see the parts before they purchase it. So there's a lot of things that's experienced inside of a store that you can't duplicate online. Again, we're not immune to online sales, but we believe that there are a lot of attributes that make it unique inside the store, the experience inside the store."

So think about 100 per quarter for the balance of the year where we had been running at about 300 stores per quarter. So we are deliberately slowing the rollout of multiple frequency of delivery.
The biggest reason that we are slowing the rollout is because we put a massive amount of change on our supply chain over the last couple of years getting to these 2,100 locations that are already on there. So just think about that, that's 4,200 incremental deliveries for our supply chain in just 2 years alone. And that has just been a massive amount of change and we need to slow down and let them absorb that change.
We're also mindful that it does impact our cost structure. And so we want to slow it down mainly for the supply chain, but also to make sure that we continue to have reasonable profitability.

First of all, yes, your assessment about what would happen without the week of the election is probably pretty accurate. We were running close to a 2 comp for the quarter.

We said that it moderated, but we still had a 250 basis point gap between what happened in those markets and what happened in the other markets. So to do the math, if there's 250 basis points and you ran a 1.6 comp, clearly those markets ran negative comp for the quarter.

Last year, during this period of time in December, it was very warm and our sales were really strong, but they weren't strong in the categories that we traditionally sold. We were doing really well with things like undercar, brakes and the like, chassis because the weather was conducive for people to do maintenance projects that they normally don't do this time of year. So we, in essence, pulled brake business forward and we didn't get the failure business. So we had a pretty strong Q2 last year. It was really Q3 and Q4 and now into Q1 where we saw the bigger impact from the lack of a serious winter last year.
So we're excited that we're about to see the first really good cold snap of the year. We're excited to see what that will mean to us, but it will be really Q3 before we expect to see any rebound."

I would say that the 14 basis points is really what we can tie specifically to more frequent deliveries. We definitely believe that there's some overhang costs that are occurring inside the distribution centers that are probably related to that. We just didn't tag it to it specifically. So our deleverage on supply chain was in the mid-20s for the quarter, but it was probably only 14 that we could specifically call to the actually more frequent deliveries. But we recognize that, look, based on the run rate that we were going as far as the rollout, this has proven to pull back a little bit and be able to improve the efficiencies of the organization as we move through this. We're still committed to rolling it out. We're just going to roll a few less as we move forward. But going forward, I would think it would be around that 15 basis points and hope for the overall deleverage will be a little bit less."

Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.
To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our company for again delivering solid results this past quarter. We continue to execute our plan and generally achieved our goals, although our sales results were below our plan.
Our domestic AutoZone business expanded, growing same-store sales 1.6% while opening another 16 new stores. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our Commercial business continued to expand with 6.3% sales growth over last year's first quarter while opening 35 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net Commercial programs this fiscal year.
At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a Commercial program. And we continue to expand in Mexico, opening 5 new stores. We didn't open any additional locations in Brazil or IMC this quarter. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone business.
While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. 
Regarding the Internet, we experienced a challenging quarter. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and Pickup In Store. Our Pickup In Store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category.
While our Pickup In Store business continues to thrive and it's growing rapidly, our ship-to-home businesses were softer than last year. Our objective is to provide our customers with exceptional service regardless of how they want to interact with us. And it isn't surprising to us that many of them want to research their purchases online and then purchase or pickup their products in store. This allows them to have immediate access to their purchases and affords them the opportunity to get the trustworthy advice they have come to expect from our AutoZoners.
While our sales shortfall in ship-to-home purchases is not surprising to us, we're continuing to invest in an accelerated rate to improve the online shopping experience to ensure that our customers' interactions with us through any channel are exceptional.
While our DIY operations remain our #1 priority, we are focused on growing our Commercial business where our share is smaller. To this end, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we've expanded our multiple delivery frequency rollouts to an additional 161 net locations and now have approximately 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores receiving 3 or more deliveries per week from our distribution centers.
Regarding our Mega Hub rollouts, we are working diligently on the development of future sites, but we did not open any incremental locations this quarter. We continue to operate 11 Mega Hubs and expect to open several more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations.
Additionally, we are continuing to expand our distribution network. In the first quarter, we opened our second distribution center in Mexico and have 2 distribution centers under construction in the United States. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later.
Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.
To this end, our national sales meeting held in Memphis at the end of September was entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service with an emphasis on saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. We've demonstrated our enhanced abilities to allow AutoZoners to be able to see and access inventory at their stores, nearby stores, hubs, Mega Hubs and vendor stock inventory.
We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Under the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme, we are focused on improving our closure rates. It is always surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores everyday not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer, we are making ongoing significant systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs.
Before getting into specifics on the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are 2 very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores and the Mega Hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available in the market before.
In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the Mega Hubs' success because we would have had to order the parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we would -- we could have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to another store.
Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores and these stores are receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least 3x a week. Some stores receive more deliveries than 3, but weekly volumes determine the need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we've settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize this was up from the usual once a week delivery schedules we'd historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turn is at a relatively low rate, around 1.4x per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of 1.
Over the next 9 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 300 stores. We have moderated our rollout pace over the remainder of the year to temper the significant change our distribution centers have to absorb and to manage our cost structure. This past quarter's deleverage was above our cost expectations. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to expand this service in those areas at lower cost. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017.
The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hubs store concept. We are currently operating 11 Mega Hubs and we'll open or expand several more Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer customers.
As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis.
Our sales results, thus far, in our open Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently, we have over 3,500 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. A majority of these 3,500 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today. But as we expand our Mega Hubs, more of them will receive this service the same day and many will receive it multiple times per day.
We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 Mega Hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a Mega Hub is, on average, 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is a challenge -- is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017.
In order to provide more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the Mega Hubs, we are moving forward on our planned opening of 2 domestic distribution centers over the next couple of years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million. For 2017, we will incur a majority of these 2 distribution centers' investments in our CapEx budget. However, we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018.
Now let's turn to our first quarter's results. Our sales increased 3.4%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.6%. This quarter's sales were consistent until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Our sales were challenged the week of the presidential election, which slowed our performance. We did experience positive comps in every month of the quarter. However, November's first week was challenging for us.
We also continue to see the lingering effects of last year's mild winter, hampering our growth in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter.
While we saw over a 400 basis point spread between these 3 markets and the others in the fourth quarter, the gap continued to tighten this quarter, where we saw an approximately 250 basis point spread, but in the last few weeks, that gap shrunk considerably. Our expectation is that this overhang will continue until winter weather returns.
In regard to our 3 primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business' mix. This was usual for this time of year. While the failure and discretionary categories were positive for DIY, the maintenance category was slightly negative. Our results were driven really by geography.
Also, while ticket was positive for both DIY and Commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result as the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets' underperformance was traffic-driven.
We opened 35 net new Commercial programs in the quarter versus 55 net new programs in last year's first quarter. Our sales grew 6.3% on the quarter in Commercial and our programs opened grew by 5%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remained strong.
Regarding Mexico, we opened 5 stores this quarter and now have 488 total stores in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong quarter. However, Mexico's sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rate, given the roughly 23% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on year-over-year quarter-ending rates. Additionally, as I said earlier, our second distribution in Mexico opened this past quarter.
Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 4.2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment. As I mentioned, we saw site traffic and ship-to-home sales challenged during the quarter. However, we saw strength in our Pickup In Store sales. This strength in Pickup In Store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pickup In Store, while smaller than home delivery, is quickly catching up in sales volume.
We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to their purchase, and our eCommerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our eCommerce platform.
With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices, on average, are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging for us.
Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, our second quarter results are our most difficult comparison. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond, we believe we should improve in those regions. Our history has shown we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and we'll be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.
Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating planned theme for 2017, ""Yes! We've Got It."" The key priorities for the year are Great People Providing Great Service!, profitably growing our Commercial business, leveraging the Internet, ""Yes! We've Got It."" and leveraging information technology.
On the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the ""Yes! We've Got It."" theme.
We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately.
In regards to Commercial, we opened 35 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs in 2017. While our sales growth rates slowed in recent quarters, the industry saw a similar slowdown. Our data shows we again gained share this past quarter. We believe last year's mild winter continued to hamper industry sales growth as regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail.
As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative.
We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our first quarter at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.
Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to deliver on their commitments. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners.
Now I'll turn it over to Bill Giles."

To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.7%.
Switching over to macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.24 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.16 a gallon, a slight decrease. Now, last year, gas prices decreased $0.42 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $2.51 and ending at $2.09 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and, as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.
We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in July, 2.9% in August and 2.9% in September. Now, we don't have October or November data yet, but year-to-date through September, miles driven are up approximately 3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time.
The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,781,000,000 -- $1,781,000 for the quarter -- for the 52 weeks ended.
Now, for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.3%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's first quarter. This past quarter, we opened 35 net new programs versus 55 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,425 stores or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs.
As we have begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016.
Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 5 new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 488 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores.
As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by a difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year.
The peso devalued over the course of the quarter, but moved from materially post the U.S. election in November. While devaluing 23% year-over-year, it weakened 11% in just this quarter, with the majority of the decline in the quarter in the first 2 weeks of November. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter, assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate, was meaningful, a roughly $6 million impact to EBIT.
We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business and we continue to feel like the moves will be manageable.
Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating 8 stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged over time by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars.
Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total, our sales were $2,468,000,000, an increase of 3.4% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 1.6% for the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 23 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.
In regards to inflation, it was, again, slightly down year-over-year. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.
Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries costs. We will work to diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.
SG&A for the quarter was 34.1% of sales, lower by 1 basis point from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year as favorability across several areas was offset by higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.
EBIT for the quarter was $459 million, up 4.8% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.3 million compared with $35 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,997,000,000 or $243 million more than last year's quarter balance of $4,754,000,000.
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 34.7% versus last year's Q1 of 35.9%. The deviation of results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose.
But additionally, I want to take a moment to discuss AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard has us recognizing the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L previously had flowed through stockholders' equity. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 74 basis points and benefited EPS accordingly. However, this accounting change also has an effect on the diluted share count calculation resulting in higher or more dilutive share count.
Net income for the quarter was $278.1 million, up 7.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.7 million was down 4.6% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $9.36, up 13% over the prior year's first quarter.
The new accounting standard just mentioned increased our diluted share count by 226,000 shares, reducing our reported EPS by $0.08 a share. Netting the benefit in our tax rate were the impact from a higher reported diluted share count raised our EPS by $0.03 on the quarter.
While not a large impact on the EPS, we feel it is important for investors to know how the accounting change will affect results. We'll continue to keep you abreast of any impacts going forward in future quarters.
Relating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $407 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 new locations this quarter; capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels and openings; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters; development of our New Mexico DC; and some minor investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments.
With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,313 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 488 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,809. We also had 26 IMC branches opened at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,835.
Depreciation totaled $71.8 million for the quarter versus last year's fiscal quarter expense of $66.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates.
With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $363 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter-end, we had $783 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x at quarter-end.
Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria.
We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.3%.
Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 7.3% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $647,000 versus $624,000 last year and $625,000 just this past quarter.
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $67,000 versus a negative $66,000 last year and negative $80,000 this past quarter.
Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes."

We are pleased to report our 41st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, delivering an EPS growth rate of 13% this quarter. While we continue to experience more regional sales differences than usual, our company executed exceptionally well.
Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.
Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting initiatives we have in store for fiscal 2017. We will continue to expand our AutoZone store footprint in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, opening approximately 200 locations combined.
We will open roughly 200 additional Commercial programs. Our inventory availability efforts will expand with the opening of another handful of Mega Hubs and with the further expansion of multiple deliveries per week to 300 or so more stores.
We have already opened our second distribution center in Mexico and we have 2 domestic distribution centers currently under construction.
Our investments in technology continue to accelerate with an intensified focus on our online offerings. 
And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying ""Yes! We've Got It."" to our customers. We are determined to meet all of our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations.
We are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we'll leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.
We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure we -- and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.
Now we'd like to open up the call to questions."

Secondly, during the quarter, we were a little less promotional online and we pulled back a little bit from some of our paid advertising as well.
What we're more focused on is improving the experience for the customer. And as Bill mentioned before, we continue to drive a lot of sales through buy online and Pickup In Store, and that part of the business continues to remain very strong.
From a pure ship-to-home basis on both autozone.com and AutoAnything, those were a little softer during the quarter. But like I said, we've -- that we were a little less promotional during the quarter and we're also investing some things in the platform that will probably slow us down a little bit as we continue to migrate through that.
So when you think about eCommerce, we're not immune to sales through eCommerce. But at the same time, when you think about the experience that you have walking into an AutoZone store, there's a lot of trustworthy advice that's taking place. And so when someone walks in and wants to buy a battery, which you can't buy online because you can't ship it, we'll likely test your entire starting and charging system in order to ensure that, that is the problem that you are -- we are going to solve for you. So there's a lot of things that take place in a store between starters and alternators that are -- that have cores attached that require those products to come back. There is an ability for an AutoZoner to walk out to the car and be able to assess and ensure that the customer is getting what they need and being able to resolve their issues and being able to see the parts before they purchase it. So there's a lot of things that's experienced inside of a store that you can't duplicate online. Again, we're not immune to online sales, but we believe that there are a lot of attributes that make it unique inside the store, the experience inside the store."

So think about 100 per quarter for the balance of the year where we had been running at about 300 stores per quarter. So we are deliberately slowing the rollout of multiple frequency of delivery.
The biggest reason that we are slowing the rollout is because we put a massive amount of change on our supply chain over the last couple of years getting to these 2,100 locations that are already on there. So just think about that, that's 4,200 incremental deliveries for our supply chain in just 2 years alone. And that has just been a massive amount of change and we need to slow down and let them absorb that change.
We're also mindful that it does impact our cost structure. And so we want to slow it down mainly for the supply chain, but also to make sure that we continue to have reasonable profitability. And as we mentioned, it cost us roughly 15 basis points in the quarter, but there are other costs that aren't in that number just from the amount of change that we had in our supply chain and those kind of things.

First of all, yes, your assessment about what would happen without the week of the election is probably pretty accurate. We were running close to a 2 comp for the quarter. I do believe that there is still a headwind in our overall comp from the lingering effects of last year's mild winter. We said that it moderated, but we still had a 250 basis point gap between what happened in those markets and what happened in the other markets. So to do the math, if there's 250 basis points and you ran a 1.6 comp, clearly those markets ran negative comp for the quarter.
I believe, just as we saw in 2012, once the effects of a cold winter hit, we will see improvements in our overall comps in those markets clearly. But I'd also want to be careful. It's not going to happen overnight. And I'll give you some examples. Last year, during this period of time in December, it was very warm and our sales were really strong, but they weren't strong in the categories that we traditionally sold. We were doing really well with things like undercar, brakes and the like, chassis because the weather was conducive for people to do maintenance projects that they normally don't do this time of year. So we, in essence, pulled brake business forward and we didn't get the failure business. So we had a pretty strong Q2 last year. It was really Q3 and Q4 and now into Q1 where we saw the bigger impact from the lack of a serious winter last year.
So we're excited that we're about to see the first really good cold snap of the year. We're excited to see what that will mean to us, but it will be really Q3 before we expect to see any rebound."
