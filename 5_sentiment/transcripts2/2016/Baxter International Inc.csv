Good morning, and thanks for joining us. 
Before our commenting on our performance this fourth quarter, I wanted to share few initial impressions about what I have observed during the past several weeks and why I'm excited about the opportunities that lay ahead. 
Clearly, we're building on a very strong foundation. Baxter has established one of the most trusted and respected brands in the health care industry and over this, with history, we have built a durable portfolio of market-leading products as broad geography reach that spans more than 100 countries. Clearly, we have an outstanding base for expanding margins and accelerating performance and following last year's spin-off of Baxalta, we can now devote our attention to these strategies and investments that will drive profitable growth across the business and create value as we aspire to deliver top quartile total shareholder returns for our investors. 
The initial steps that are already well underway, which is reflecting Baxter's fourth quarter results. As you saw in this morning's release, we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeding our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Operating income up 10.7% compared favorably to our guidance of 9.5% to 10%. After adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and the generic market and strength in the U.S. for cyclophosphamide, we reported sales growth of 4% in the quarter, also ahead of our expectations. 
Key growth drivers in the quarter included a strong performance in the U.S. with systems franchise while our nearly launched SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump continues to build momentum as well as increase the demand and favorable pricing for our IV Solutions. 
Performance was also augmented by strength in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, which reported the highest quarterly growth of the year. 
The U.S. PD business has seen very promising early results under recent launch of our AMIA APD cycler, which features our SHARESOURCE 2-way connectivity platform and we look forward to expanding this launch in 2016. 
So overall, a positive quarter and a great base to build on for the future. As for what the future looks like, we are in the process of developing a strategic framework that will shape our priorities and direct our approach in investments moving forward. I'm confident this framework will drive sustainable growth for Baxter and could enhance the value for our shareholder. 
Simply put, our objective is to further accelerate and increase the impact of our margin improvement plans to support our goal of top quartile shareholder return to successfully achieve this outcome, we will execute on 3 distinct strategic factors, including portfolio optimization, operational excellence and capital allocation. 
In terms of portfolio optimization, we'll take a approach to portfolio management, which we include categorizing our businesses based on the existing financial profile and future potential. And accordingly, we will reallocate investments based on the ability to drive innovation. 
In addition, we intensifying our focus on both R&D, velocity and productivity to support our top and bottom line growth initiatives. 
The secondary are of our strategic focus is operational excellence. We are aggressively examining our cost structure in terms of how we do business for manufacturing and operations to commercial and corporate infrastructure. I'm confident we can take additional cost out of our business without compromising our commitment to quality and safety. 
Related to this, we also ensure our capital expenditures are optimally allocated to projects that enhance bottom line growth and support long-term value creation. 
And the final strategic focus area for us is capital allocation where we are committed to deploying capital in a manner that creates value over both the short and long-term. We'll be showing more information about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on May 9 in New York City. At that meeting, we'll provide more specifics around our objectives along with our 3- and 5-year aspirational financial factors. We know there is a lot of hard work in front of us, but our team is energized and well-prepared for the role ahead. 
And with that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on our fourth quarter performance and outlook for 2016. Then we'll have time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from strong operation",1953,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from strong operational performance and our Fluid Systems, PD and Acute businesses as well as operating expense savings resulting from our disciplined management of costs and the restructuring initiatives we announced last quarter. 
In addition, other income from foreign exchange related games and a favorable tax rate both contributed to our performance in the quarter. 
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with sales. Worldwide revenues of $2.6 billion increased 2% on a constant currency basis. This performance compared favorably to our Q4 guidance of a 1% sales decline where better-than-expected sales growth observed across the portfolio, particularly in our Fluid Systems, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions and renal franchises. 
Including the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 7% on a reported basis. And excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and U.S. cyclophosphamide, Baxter's sales rose 4% globally. 
Sales in the U.S. increased 1% on a reported basis and after adjusting for cyclophosphamide, U.S. sales advanced 7%. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 2% and declined 12% on a reported basis. 
Turning now to the drivers of business performance in the quarter. Please note, I will be speaking to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchises to provide a clear picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance. 
Starting with Hospital Products. Global sales totaled $1.6 billion and increased 2% and after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide, sales for the Hospital Products, this products business, increased 5%. 
Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales of $569 million advanced 12%. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth of more than 20% in the Infusion systems business, supported by the successful launch of our next generation SIGMA SPECTRUM pump and the related access set pull through. 
In addition, sales of IV solutions in the quarter benefited from favorable pricing and demand, particularly in the United States. 
Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $595 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Excluding U.S. cyclo sales, revenues in the category increased 8%, driven by strength across the franchise, which includes our nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. 
Fourth Quarter U.S. cyclo sales totaled $65 million, representing a benefit of approximately $10 million versus our previous guidance.  For the full year, U.S. cyclo sales totaled approximately $270 million. 
Fourth quarter revenues in Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and BioSurgery products totaled $346 million and were comparable to the prior year period. 
Performance benefited from low single digit growth of our anesthesia business and core surgical sealant and homeostasis products, which both increased in line with surgical procedure volume growth. This performance was offset by lower sales of select noncore BioSurgery products. 
Finally, sales in the BioPharma Solutions and Other category, which is our former partnering business, totaled $109 million and has expected to decline 22%. As we previously highlighted, this decline is driven by a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. 
As we mentioned last quarter, this category also reflects sales for products Baxter is manufacturing in the half of Baxalta, which totaled approximately $13 million in the quarter. 
Turning to the Renal business. Global renal sales totaled $984 million, representing an increase of 1%. Performance in the quarter was driven by high single digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business. As Joe mentioned, we're very excited about the prospects for this business, which will benefit from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler. 
In addition, we experienced low teens growth globally in our acute business, driven by underlying market growth and an increased adoption of continuous renal replacement therapy as a treatment option for acute kidney injuries. 
Growth in the Renal business was offset by lower sales in our insensor client hemodialysis business resulting from our previously discussed decision to forgo certain lower-margin sales opportunity, along with competitive pressures for dialyzers. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 42.6%, slightly ahead of our expectation, driven by favorable product mix in the quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $672 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis. 
On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 11%, reflecting the benefit of the initial actions we have taken to rebase our cost structure and reduce discretionary expenses and the impact from transition servicing we receive from Baxalta during the quarter, which totaled approximately $30 million. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $158 million increased 2% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted R&D expenditures increased 9% as we balanced increased investments to support our new product pipeline with efforts to optimize our overall R&D spend. 
Consistent with our portfolio optimization priorities, during the quarter, we made a decision to continue development of select programs and as a result, absorbed approximately $15 million in expenses related to these decisions.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.7%, which compared favorably to our a guidance of 9.5% to 10%, driven by the positive gross margin mix and SG&A savings I just referenced. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we'll continue to streamline our operations and control spending to drive ongoing margin expansion. 
Interest expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter. 
Last week, we executed our first transaction with respect to the retained Baxalta stakes. And this transaction, we've changed approximately 38 million Baxalta shares or approximately 28% of the total original equity stake to retire $1.45 billion of indebtedness under one of our bank lines. Over the next several months, we'll look further to deploy the remaining Baxalta equity through a combination of additional debt for equity and equity for equity exchanges as well as make a contribution of at least $600 million worth equity to our U.S. qualified pension plan subject to final regulatory approval. Our goal is to exit our retained equity position prior to any shareholder vote for the Baxalta-Shire transaction to minimize the risk of any potential negative tax implications, and we have an agreement in place to Shire and Baxalta to assist with the orderly disposition from the stake. 
For 2016, we expect these retained stake related actions to benefit our earnings by approximately $0.15 per dilutive share. 
In terms of key balance sheet items, after giving effect to the extinguishment of the bank line, our current growth outstanding debt balance is approximately $5 billion and cash on hand as of 2015 totaled approximately $2.2 billion. 
Other income totaled $36 million and included a foreign exchange gain from hedges on balance sheet positions of approximately $20 million and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake. 
The adjusted tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter. This compared favorably to our guidance and contributed approximately $0.02 to our earnings per share in the quarter. The lower tax rate was driven by the extension of R&D tax credit as slight shift in our sales mix and certain other adjustments. 
And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per share. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant currency basis, we expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase 2% to 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclo impact, we expect underlying growth of 3% to 4%. 
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to decline approximately 1%. 
This is driven by growth in the Hospital Products business, up 2% to 3% or 4% to 5%, excluding U.S. cyclo. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of 6% to 8% for Fluid Systems, driven by strength in the U.S. business, partially offset by the International business where we continue our efforts to optimize our geographic footprint of this franchise. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline mid-single digit, including the impact of U.S. cyclo. 
For full year 2016, we anticipate at least 2 additional competitive entrance, specifically 1 to enter mid-year and the second to enter towards the latter part of 2016. As a result, we expect U.S. cyclophosphamide sale to total approximately $180 million, representing a $90 million year-over-year decline. Sales for the category after adjusting for cyclophosphamide are expected to be comparable to prior years. 
I would also remind you that in 2015, we recognized approximately $40 million in government sales for Protopam. Given the purchasing pattern associated with this product, we do not anticipate any sales in 2016 in IPS. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 2% to 3%. And finally, the Hospital Products business, we expect the other category, which includes our BioPharma Solutions franchise, to increase low double digits as we anniversary the impact of our customer transitioning their manufacturing in house. This also reflect an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $25 million associated with contract manufacturing revenues from Baxalta. 
For the Renal business, we expect full year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses and a stabilization in our in center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We expect an operating margin of approximately 11%, which compares favorably to the guidance we provided at our 2015 May investor conference of approximately 10%. 
We expect interest expense to total approximately $9 million. This reflects the recent extinguishment of our bank line, along with additional debt repayment, based on further utilization of the resting state. 
For 2016, we expect modest other income of approximately $10 million. This represents the year-over-year decline of approximately $150 million. 
In 2015, we benefited from certain balance sheet hedge gain and select equity gains related to our Baxter ventures portfolio, neither of which is planned to repeat in 2016. 
For the year, we expect an average FX adjusted tax rate of 19.5% to 20%. This represents an increase from 2015, driven primarily by the change in earnings mix. 
For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 540 million shares. This reduction is driven by equity for equity changes that we anticipate to execute as part of our routine stake strategy later in the second quarter. 
Please note, there are interest expense and share count guidance reflects a preliminary base case of retained stake execution plan and is subject to change as we reassess the optimal size and mix of our remaining transaction as market and other condition evolve. We anticipate providing updates to our guidance and additional detail around the actual impacts of our retained stake transaction is appropriate as we move forward. 
Based on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share for 2016. 
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million resulting in free cash flow from -- for 2016 of approximately $500 million. This is also favorable to the guidance we provided in May. 
Specific to the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to decline approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

When also we look at execution, we need to continue to improve our execution on a global basis and make sure that we are in the right businesses around the globe. Being global is not to be all over the place, so we need to make sure that we focus in countries in geographies for businesses that makes sense. So all this work is in process as we speak.

So there are a number of different variables that have impacted our performance since we Saturday together in May. I'll highlight may be the 4 most significant. As David pointed out, we guided to an operating margin of 10% for 2016. Obviously, we're very pleased to report our expectations now on an 11% operating income margin. One of the key drivers relates to foreign exchange. The foreign exchange environment since May has moved very significantly. We can talk later about EPS impacts, but from an operating margin impact relative to our May expectations, we're down about 1.4% in terms of margin impact due to foreign exchange. As you recall, in the second half of the year, a lot of the emerging markets currencies moved while the developing market currencies stabilized. And for us because we don't hedge emerging market currencies, it did have a 1.4% impact on our overall margin. We did have higher-than-expected cyclo in 2016, so as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we'll achieve about $180 million of cyclo sales in 2016. That's roughly 1 percentage point higher than we expected. We also have positive pension. There are a number of impact that we have with respect to our pension, some of which we had anticipated in part related to the contribution of the retained stake, but some of which we did not anticipate, and that's about 60 basis points of improvement as we move to 2016. But I will tell you the area that's most important as we look at the stability of the operations, from my perspective, relates to the operational performance and OpEx savings, which contribute about 1 point of margin improvement relative to our May investor conference expectations. So those are the 4 factors with cyclo and pension, essentially offsetting FX and then the overachievement, really, in my view, coming from operational strength."

We're almost there completing that analysis. We put our portfolio through about 5 different filters, and we actually have a pretty good idea, the things that we will invest with top line growth versus ROIC once the strategic and ones that we're going to manage more for cash. I would say to you, I'm going to give a few examples. We have a very good IPS business, the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions is a very good business and is something that we probably can double down. As an example, we'll be making organic investments, possibly, inorganic investments. I just want to circle back to your comment about large-sized M&A. When we go down this path, and we look at inorganic opportunities, size is now what matters, but the ability, the ability to change the weighted average market gross rate of our business is key to us. And those acquisitions will be singles and doubles, they will not be the things that one shot. We're going to make right decisions whether our shareholders' money. And we need to balance that well, but we need to make sure also that we can successfully integrate and generate a step change in how we grow that business that we acquired. So we'll be focusing, great deal of attention in the value that business brings to us strategic but IPS is a good place to start."

I mean, look, we were -- Fluid Systems really has 2 primary drivers of growth in the fourth quarter and then also as we move to next year, we'll see similar levels of performance based on those 2 drivers. And the first one, I would say, is the Infusion Systems business. In particular, in the U.S., we had well north of 20% growth in our infusion systems business and breaking that down, there's 2 components of that. One is the sale of the spectrum pump, which is recently relaunched, and that clearly is capital related. But as I think about the long-term sustainability of the business, really, we very pleased with the set associated with as we have very strong performance in set sales as well into double digits. So those were the 2 drivers on the Infusion systems side. From an IV therapy standpoint,we commented previously about the conditions, the marketplace conditions, some of the actions that we've taken and also continued demand for this important product. And so we did report very solid growth in the IV therapy business as well, well into double digits. And so in combination, these items contributed to, in the U.S. and my growth rates are in relation to the U.S., the Fluid Systems growth that we reported of 27%. So clearly, this was a bright spot for us. We do expect this to continue, but of course, not at the Q4 rates, so we'll see some moderation as we move to the 2016 plan. So overall, we're very pleased with it. Some of it is related to capital spending, but as you know, most hospitals have lapse for many years in attractive alternative from a pump standpoint for a variety of different reasons.

Mike, maybe I'll take a step back and address the retained stake overall to address your question and for clarity. From the retained stakes standpoint, there are two things there that are very clear to us today. First, as you know, we are in the process of finalizing the bank line transaction, which is going to reduce our gross debt by $1.45 billion. That will be completed imminently. The second item is in this quarter, we expect to contribute more than $600 million in equity to our pension plan. That, of course, is subject to Department of Labor approval. So those things are, in I my view, very definitive. As we move on to the remaining transactions, our preliminary plan is to pursue 2 additional transactions. One is an equity for debt exchange and the second is an equity-for-equity split off. We currently expect to pursue the debt exchange early in Q2 and the equity exchange closer to mid-year. There's going to be a number of factors that lead us to finally size these transactions, but you're right. From a placeholder standpoint, our current view is that we'll use at Baxalta's current price, a little more than $2 billion to retire debt and a little less than $1 billion to retire equity. But as I said before, these transactions are subject to market conditions, optimal pricing and our objective is to maximize long-term value and optimize economics with respect to these transactions. So as far as definitive plans, I can tell you, these are our very preliminary plans but by no means definitive. We're evaluating what the optimal mix is, so there may be changes to these transactions as we move forward based on the receptivity of the market and the number of other factors. As we finalize plans and execute transactions, clearly, we'll update guidance. But we have enough information today to share with you these preliminary estimates, which provides sort of some balance around the guidance range that we're given. In combination, we expect about a $0.15 benefit this year. There will be some increased to next year in part because of the equity-for-equity transaction would occur very close to mid-year in this plan assumption and also the equity for debt exchange, we'll have at least a quarter more of benefit rolling into 2017."

The big part of that is putting this Baxalta stake and ultimately your balance sheet to work to create value. You talked about doing more likely a series of smaller deals to achieve those objectives. As you think about that, is the #1 priority to accelerate the overall mix of growth in the company's end markets? Or should we look at it as more ROIC-driven or margin-driven? Maybe just help us think about if you're looking, if you have targets and if you're looking to do something particularly for the company, is it accelerating the top line or how do we think about that mix?"

So what can we do to change the trajectory of the company top line growth and bottom line, what comes first? So we need to -- we already have embarked on this very extensive operational excellence program to cut costs. We're going to double down on that and get to be a little bit more aggressive. That will create some momentum as we continue to look for the opportunities at the top line. When you talk about the capital allocation of top line, we have about 4, 5 businesses that we probably get a significant amount of investment from the company on the organic arena. I'm going to talk more about that in May, I don't want to preempt that now. But also, we're going to invest inorganically in those businesses. When we talk about how to hit it well, we want to change -- we want to buy business that are growing faster than our current base business. That is a pretty obvious thing. Second thing is you can combine that with good synergistic deal, we'll do it as well. And why do I put at very likely because there are large deals that are very difficult to find. We can keep looking for a deal like that, or will take a couple of years of versus just creating a really good strategy by looking at the adjacencies and tapping good businesses with acquisitions that makes sense. I don't discuss size being large, but I think it's much more difficult to encounter that than something else that will create almost instantly and you can execute a little faster. So I'm looking at this whole thing as a journey where we make sure that our cost is in place while augment our internal renovation and supplement internal innovation with some really well thought out acquisitions."

There is an important point to make, which is, and you know this about our business, Bob. We have seasonality, which typically the second half of the year is stronger than the first half and the fourth quarter is typically one of the strongest margin quarters that we have in large part because of incremental sales performance that naturally occurs. And so as we think about margin performance next year versus this year, I do think it's important to look at the entire year holistically. And if you think about the full year for 2015, we add about approximately a 9% margin going to the 11% that we've guided to. So it is a fairly substantial step change improvement in margin. The other point I will make is our Q1 guidance does have the lowest margin of the year. Again, in part driven by the fact that Q1 sales are typically the lightest because of all the fixed cost we have in place, there is some absorption that did not occur due to the lower level of sales. So I think those are a couple of important points. By and large, we're very pleased with the margin improvement that this plan indicates. The second of half of the year was very important for us in large part because it gave us confidence that we could give guidance for 2016, and we could operate effectively on a standalone basis. But I do think it's important to consider the seasonality and the trending in margin when we think about 2016."

Foreign exchange is about a 1.6 point on a year-over-year basis margin drag, so it's a very substantial relative to May on a year-over-year basis, it's even more than that. The pension, again, is about 1 point of improvement year-over-year. But then there a number of other critical items, and again, these are the ones that I'm happiest to point out. SG&A savings, we're  talking about a 2 percentage point improvement in SG&A. R&D savings, we're talking about a 60 basis points improvement. And then operationally, because many of the initiatives that we're putting in place from a mix volume standpoint, along with some of our pricing and economic value capture initiatives, along with general business growth, yields approximately a little more than 1 percentage point of margin improvement. So I walk you through a number of items there, and there's a lot of moving pieces that take us from the 9 to 11. But as I say, there are a number of important ones that we can point to operationally that are really driving this improvement that I think based on the second half of this year, we have confidence in this as we move forward."

And then the remaining portion, there's few different pieces. First, the actual discount rate used to measure the liability has increased and of the result of that is at $0.035 benefit. Second, as we were evaluated our accounting for our pension plan, we made 3 adjustments. One is we updated the mortality table that we're using. The second is we are now employing the recently approved methodology for counting for discount the rate, and the best of the benefit. And then the return on assets assumption is an item that we've lowered. So those 3 accounting changes that we've made impact us positively by about $0.02. And then we have some amortized losses that are rolling off, so that's about a $0.01. So in combination, we're talking about a $0.14 year-over-year impact, and importantly, this counteracts some of the negatives like the lack of sundry income that we experienced in 2016, along with the significant headwind of foreign exchange. But overall, the pension impact is in that order of magnitude."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before our commenting on our performance in the fourth quarter, I wanted to share a few initial impressions about what I have observed during the past several weeks and why I'm excited about the opportunities that lay ahead.
Clearly, we're building on a very strong foundation. Baxter has established one of the most trusted and respected brands in the health care industry. And over this rich history, we have built a durable portfolio of market-leading products with broad geography reach that spans more than 100 countries. Clearly, we have an outstanding base for expanding margins and accelerating performance. And following last year's spin-off of Baxalta, we can now devote our attention to these strategies and investments that will drive profitable growth across the business and create value as we aspire to deliver top quartile total shareholder returns for our investors.
The initial steps are already well underway, which is reflecting Baxter's fourth quarter results. As you saw in this morning's release, we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Operating income, up 10.7% compared favorably to our guidance of 9.5% to 10%. After adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and the generic market and strength in the U.S. for cyclophosphamide, we reported sales growth of 4% in the quarter, also ahead of our expectations.
Key growth drivers in the quarter included a strong performance in our U.S. Fluid Systems franchise, while our nearly launched SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump continues to build momentum as well as increase the demand and favorable pricing for our IV solutions. Performance was also augmented by strength in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, which reported the highest quarterly growth of the year. The U.S. PD business has seen very promising early results on the recent launch of our AMIA APD cycler, which features our SHARESOURCE 2-way connectivity platform, and we look forward to expanding this launch in 2016.
So overall, a positive quarter and a great base to build on for the future. As for what the future looks like, we are in the process of developing a strategic framework that will shape our priorities and direct our approach in investments moving forward. I'm confident this framework will drive sustainable growth for Baxter and could enhance the value for our shareholders.
Simply put, our objective is to further accelerate and increase the impact of our margin improvement plans to support our goal of top quartile shareholder return. To successfully achieve this outcome, we will execute on 3 distinct strategic vectors, [ph] including portfolio optimization, operational excellence and capital allocation.
In terms of portfolio optimization, we'll take approach to portfolio management, which we include categorizing our businesses based on the existing financial profile and future potential. And accordingly, we will reallocate investments based on the ability to drive innovation. In addition, we intensifying our focus on both R&D, velocity and productivity to support our top and bottom line growth initiatives.
The second area of strategic focus is operational excellence. We are aggressively examining our cost structure in terms of how we do business for manufacturing and operations to commercial and corporate infrastructure. I am confident we can take additional cost out of our business without compromising our commitment to quality and safety. Related to this, we also ensure our capital expenditures are optimally allocated to projects that enhance bottom line growth and support long-term value creation.
And the final strategic focus area for us is capital allocation where we are committed to deploying capital in a manner that creates value over both the short and long term. We'll be sharing more information about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on May 9 in New York City. At that meeting, we'll provide more specifics around our objectives along with our 3- and 5-year aspirational financial targets. We know there is a lot of hard work in front of us, but our team is energized and well prepared for the road ahead.
And with that, I will pass it to Jay for more details on our fourth quarter performance and outlook for 2016. Then we'll have time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the second -- in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from",1947,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the second -- in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from strong operational performance on our Fluid Systems, PD and acute businesses as well as operating expense savings resulting from our disciplined management of costs and the restructuring initiative we announced last quarter. In addition, other income from foreign exchange related gains and a favorable tax rate both contributed to outperformance in the quarter.
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2016. Starting with sales, worldwide revenues of $2.6 billion increased 2% on a constant currency basis. This performance compared favorably to our Q4 guidance of a 1% sales decline with better-than-expected sales growth observed across the portfolio, particularly in our Fluid Systems, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions and Renal franchises.
Including the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 7% on a reported basis. And excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and U.S. cyclophosphamide, Baxter's sales rose 4% globally. Sales in the U.S. increased 1% on a reported basis, and after adjusting for cyclophosphamide, U.S. sales advanced 7%. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 2% and declined 12% on a reported basis.
Turning now to the drivers of business performance in the quarter. Please note, I will be speaking to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchises to provide a clearer picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance.
Starting with Hospital Products. Global sales totaled $1.6 billion and increased 2%. And after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide, sales for the Hospital Products business increased 5%. Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales of $569 million advanced 12%. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth of more than 20% in the infusion systems business, supported by the successful launch of our next-generation SIGMA Spectrum pump and the related Access sets pull through. In addition, sales of IV Solutions in the quarter benefited from favorable pricing and demand, particularly in the United States.
Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $595 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Excluding U.S. cyclo sales, revenues in the category increased 8%, driven by strength across the franchise, which includes our nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Fourth quarter U.S. cyclo sales totaled $65 million, representing a benefit of approximately $10 million versus our previous guidance. For the full year, U.S. cyclo sales totaled approximately $270 million.
Fourth quarter revenues in Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and BioSurgery products, totaled $346 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Performance benefited from low single-digit growth of our anesthesia business and core surgical sealant and hemostasis products, which both increased in line with surgical procedure volume growth. This performance was offset by lower sales of select noncore BioSurgery products.
Finally, sales in the BioPharma Solutions and other category, which is our former partnering [ph] business, totaled $109 million and as expected, declined 22%. As we previously highlighted, this decline is driven by a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. As we mentioned last quarter, this category also reflects sales for products Baxter is manufacturing on behalf of Baxalta, which totaled approximately $13 million in the quarter.
Turning to the Renal business. Global renal sales totaled $984 million, representing an increase of 1%. Performance in the quarter was driven by high single digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business. As Joe mentioned, we're very excited about the prospects for this business, which will benefit from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler.
In addition, we experienced low teens growth globally in our acute business, driven by underlying market growth and an increased adoption of continuous renal replacement therapy as a treatment option for acute kidney injuries. Growth in the Renal business was offset by lower sales in our in-center chronic hemodialysis business, resulting from our previously discussed decision to forgo certain lower-margin sales opportunities, along with competitive pressures for dialyzers.
Turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 42.6%, slightly ahead of our expectations, driven by favorable product mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $672 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 11%, reflecting the benefit of the initial actions we have taken to rebase our cost structure and reduce discretionary expenses and the impact from transition servicing we receive from Baxalta during the quarter, which totaled approximately $30 million.
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $158 million increased 2% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted R&D expenditures increased 9% as we balanced increased investments to support our new product pipeline with efforts to optimize our overall R&D spend. Consistent with our portfolio optimization priorities, during the quarter, we made the decision to discontinue the development of select programs and as a result, absorbed approximately $15 million in expenses related to these decisions.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.7%, which compared favorably to our guidance of 9.5% to 10%, driven by the positive gross margin mix and SG&A savings I just referenced. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we'll continue to streamline our operations and control spending to drive ongoing margin expansion. Interest expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter.
Last week, we executed our first transaction with respect to the retained Baxalta stake. In this transaction, we had changed approximately 38 million Baxalta shares or approximately 28% of the total original equity stake to retire $1.45 billion of indebtedness under one of our bank lines. Over the next several months, we'll look further to deploy the remaining Baxalta equity through a combination of additional debt-for-equity and equity-for-equity exchanges as well as make a contribution of at least $600 million worth of equity to our U.S. qualified pension plan subject to final regulatory approval.
Our goal is to exit our retained equity position prior to any shareholder vote for the Baxalta-Shire transaction to minimize the risk of any potential negative tax implications. And we have an agreement in place with Shire and Baxalta to assist with the orderly disposition of the stake. For 2016, we expect these retained stake related actions to benefit our earnings by approximately $0.15 per dilutive share.
In terms of key balance sheet items, after giving effect to the extinguishment of the bank line, our current gross outstanding debt balance is approximately $5 billion, and cash on hand at the end of 2015 totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Other income totaled $36 million and included a foreign exchange gain from hedges on balance sheet positions of approximately $20 million and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake.
The adjusted tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter. This compared favorably to our guidance and contributed approximately $0.02 to our earnings per share in the quarter. The lower tax rate was driven by the extension of R&D tax credit as slight shift in our sales mix and certain other adjustments. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per share.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant currency basis, we expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase 2% to 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclo impact, we expect underlying growth of 3% to 4%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to decline approximately 1%. This is driven by growth in the Hospital Products business, up 2% to 3%, or 4% to 5% excluding U.S. cyclo. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of 6% to 8% for Fluid Systems, driven by strength in the U.S. business, partially offset by the International business where we continue our efforts to optimize our geographic footprint for this franchise.
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline mid-single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclo. 
For full year 2016, we anticipate at least 2 additional competitive entrants, specifically one to enter midyear and the second to enter towards the latter part of 2016. As a result, we expect U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to total approximately $180 million, representing a $90 million year-over-year decline. Sales for the category after adjusting for cyclophosphamide are expected to be comparable to prior years.
I would also remind you that in 2015, we recognized approximately $40 million in government sales for Protopam. Given the purchasing pattern associated with this product, we do not anticipate any sales in 2016 in IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 2% to 3%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect the other category, which includes our BioPharma Solutions franchise, to increase low double digits as we anniversary the impact of our customer transitioning their manufacturing in-house. This also reflect an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $25 million associated with contract manufacturing revenues from Baxalta.
For the Renal business, we expect full year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses and a stabilization in our in-center HD business.
Moving down the P&L. We expect an operating margin of approximately 11%, which compares favorably to the guidance we provided at our 2015 May investor conference of approximately 10%. We expect interest expense to total approximately $90 million. This reflects the recent extinguishment of our bank line, along with additional debt repayment, based on further utilization of the routine stake.
For 2016, we expect modest other income of approximately $10 million. This represents a year-over-year decline of approximately $150 million. In 2015, we benefited from certain balance sheet hedge gain and select equity gains related to our Baxter Ventures portfolio, neither of which is planned to repeat in 2016.
For the year, we expect an average FX adjusted tax rate of 19.5% to 20%. This represents an increase from 2015, driven primarily by the change in earnings mix.
For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 540 million shares. This reduction is driven by equity-for-equity changes that we anticipate to execute as part of our routine stake strategy later in the second quarter.
Please note that our interest expense and share count guidance reflects a preliminary base case retained stake execution plan and is subject to change as we reassess the optimal size and mix of our remaining transactions as market and other conditions evolve. We anticipate providing updates to our guidance and additional detail around the actual impacts of our retained stake transaction as appropriate as we move forward.
Based on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share for 2016.
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million resulting in free cash flow from -- for 2016 of approximately $500 million. This is also favorable to the guidance we provided in May.
Specific to the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to decline approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

When, also, we look at execution, we need to continue to improve our execution on a global basis and make sure that we are in the right businesses around the globe. Being global is not to be all over the place, so we need to make sure that we focus in countries and geographies for businesses that make sense. So all this work is in process as we speak.

One of the key drivers relates to foreign exchange. The foreign exchange environment since May has moved very significantly. We can talk later about EPS impacts. But from an operating margin impact relative to our May expectations, we're down about 1.4% in terms of margin impact due to foreign exchange. As you recall, in the second half of the year, a lot of the emerging markets currencies moved while the developing market currencies stabilized. And for us, because we don't hedge emerging market currencies, it did have a 1.4% impact on our overall margin. We did have higher-than-expected cyclo in 2016, so as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we'll achieve about $180 million of cyclo sales in 2016. That's roughly 1 percentage point higher than we expected. We also have positive pension. There are a number of impacts that we have with respect to our pension, some of which we had anticipated in part related to the contribution of the retained stake, but some of which we did not anticipate. And that's about 60 basis points of improvement as we move to 2016. But I will tell you, the area that's most important as we look at the stability of the operations, from my perspective, relates to the operational performance and OpEx savings, which contribute about 1 point of margin improvement relative to our May investor conference expectations. So those are the 4 factors with cyclo and pension essentially offsetting FX and then the overachievement, really, in my view, coming from operational strength."

We've put our portfolio through -- about 5 different filters. And we actually have a pretty good idea, the things that we will invest with top line growth versus ROIC, ones that are strategic bets [ph] and ones that we're going to manage more for cash. I would say to you, I'm going to give a few examples. We have a very good IPS business. The Integrated Pharmacy Solutions is a very good business and is something that we probably can double down. As an example, we'll be making organic investments, possibly inorganic investments. I just want to circle back to your comment about large-size M&A. When we go down this path, and we look at inorganic opportunities, size is now what matters. But the ability, the ability to change the weighted average market gross rate of our business is key to us. And those acquisitions will be singles and doubles. They will not be big things at one shot. We're going to make right decisions with our shareholders' money. And we need to balance that well, but we need to make sure also that we can successfully integrate and generate a step change in how we grow that business that we acquired. So we'll be focusing a great deal of our attention in the value that business brings to us that's strategic, but IPS is a good place to start."

I mean, look, we were -- we have -- Fluid Systems really has 2 primary drivers of growth in the fourth quarter and then also as we move to next year, we'll see similar levels of performance and based on those 2 drivers. And the first one, I would say, is the infusion systems business. In particular, in the U.S., we had well north of 20% growth in our infusion systems business. And breaking that down, there's 2 components of that. One is the sale of the Spectrum pump, which has recently relaunched and that clearly is capital related. But as I think about the long-term sustainability of the business, really, we very pleased with the success [ph] associated with that since we have very strong performance in set sales as well into double digits. So those were the 2 drivers on the infusion system side. From an IV therapy standpoint, we commented previously about the conditions, the marketplace conditions, some of the actions that we've taken and also continued demand for this important product. And so we did report very solid growth in the IV therapy business as well, well into double digits. And so in combination, these items contributed to, in the U.S. and my growth rates are in relation to the U.S. The Fluid Systems growth that we reported of 27%. So clearly, this was a bright spot for us. We do expect this to continue, but of course, not at the Q4 rates. So we'll see some moderation as we move to the 2016 plan. So overall, we're very pleased with it. Some of it is related to capital spending. But as you know, most hospitals have lacked, for many years, in attractive alternative from a pump standpoint for a variety of different reasons. So we do believe there is some level of pent-up demand. We have a fairly good line of sight, the sales plan for 2016, so this is an area add that I think is really one of the growth drivers for Baxter in 2016 and beyond."

From the retained stake standpoint, there are 2 things that are very clear to us today. First, as you know, we're in the process of finalizing the bank line transaction, which is going to reduce our gross debt by $1.45 billion. That will be completed imminently. The second item is, in this quarter, we expect to contribute more than $600 million in equity to our pension plan. That, of course, is subject to Department of Labor approval. So those things are, in my view, very definitive. As we move on to the remaining transactions, our preliminary plan is to pursue 2 additional transactions. One is an equity-for-debt exchange and the second is an equity-for-equity split off. We currently expect to pursue the debt exchange early in Q2 and the equity exchange closer to midyear. There's going to be a number of factors that lead us to finally size these transactions, but you're right. From a placeholder standpoint, our current view is that we'll use, at Baxalta's current price, a little more than $2 billion to retire debt and a little less than $1 billion to retire equity. But as I said before, these transactions are subject to market conditions, optimal pricing and our objective is to maximize long-term value and optimize economics with respect to these transactions. So as far as definitive plans, I can tell you, these are our very preliminary plans but by no means definitive. We're evaluating what the optimal mix is, so there may be changes to these transactions as we move forward based on the receptivity of the market and the number of other factors. As we finalize plans and execute transactions, clearly, we'll update guidance. But we have enough information today to share with you these preliminary estimates, which provide sort of some balance around the guidance range that we're given. In combination, we expect about a $0.15 benefit this year. There will be some increase to next year in part because the equity-for-equity transaction would occur very close to midyear in this planned assumption and also, the equity-for-debt exchange, we'll have at least a quarter more of benefit rolling into 2017."

And Joe, let's just talk strategy for a minute. So you touched on a number of things that you talked about in San Francisco, including portfolio optimization and improving R&D productivity, improving the overall growth, exit a business and being in the top quartile of shareholder returns. The big part of that is putting this Baxalta stake and ultimately, your balance sheet, to work to create value. You talked about doing more likely a series of smaller deals to achieve those objectives. As you think about that, is the #1 priority to accelerate the overall mix of growth in the company's end markets? Or should we look at it as more ROIC-driven or margin-driven? Maybe just help us think about if you're looking -- if you have targets and if you're looking to do something particularly for the company, is it accelerating the top line? Or how do we think about that mix?"

So what can we do to change the trajectory of the company's top line growth and bottom line? What comes first? So we need to -- we already have embarked with this very extensive operational excellence program to cut costs. We're going to double down on that and become a little bit more aggressive. That will create some momentum as we continue to look for the opportunities at the top line. When you talk about the capital allocation at top line, we have about 4, 5 businesses that we probably get a significant amount of investment from the company on the organic arena. I'm going to talk more about that in May. I don't want to preempt to that now. But also, we're going to invest inorganically in opportunities for those businesses. When we talk about how to hit it well, we want to change -- we want to buy business that are growing faster than our current base business. That is a pretty obvious thing. Second thing is if you can combine that with a good synergistic deal, we'll do it as well. And why do I put it back at around very large deals because very large deals are very difficult to find. We can keep looking for a deal like that. It will take a couple of years versus just creating really a good strategy by looking at adjacencies and tapping good businesses with acquisitions that makes sense. I don't discuss size being large. But I just think it's much more difficult to encounter that than something else that will create value for almost instantly and you can execute a little faster. So I'm looking at this whole thing as a journey where we make sure that our cost is in place while augment our internal innovation and supplement internal innovation with some really well thought-out acquisitions."

There is an important point to make, which is -- and you know it's about our business, Bob. We have seasonality, which typically, the second half of the year is stronger than the first half, and the fourth quarter is typically one of the strongest margin quarters that we have in large part because of the incremental sales performance that naturally occurs. And so as we think about margin performance next year versus this year, I do think it's important to look at the entire year holistically. And if you think about the full year for 2015, we're adding about approximately a 9% margin going to the 11% that we've guided to. So it is a fairly substantial step change improvement in margin. The other point I will make is our Q1 guidance does have the lowest margin of the year. Again, in part driven by the fact that Q1 sales are typically the lightest. I mean, because of all the fixed cost we have in place, there is some absorption that does not occur due to the lower level of sales. So I think those are a couple of important points. By and large, we're very pleased with the margin improvement that this plan indicates. The second of half of the year was very important for us in large part because it gave us confidence that we could give solid guidance for 2016 and that we could operate effectively on a standalone basis. But I do think it's important to consider the seasonality and the trending in margin when we think about 2016."

Foreign exchange is about a 1.6 point on a year-over-year basis margin drag, so it's a very substantial -- relative to May at the last -- on a year-over-year basis, it's even more than that. The pension, again, is about 1 point of improvement year-over-year. But then, there a number of other critical items and again, these are the ones that I'm happiest to point out. SG&A savings, we're talking about a 2 percentage point improvement in SG&A. R&D savings, we're talking about a 60 basis point improvement. And then operationally, because many of the initiatives that we're putting in place from a mix volume standpoint, along with some of our pricing and economic value capture initiatives, along with general business growth, yields approximately a little more than 1 percentage point of margin improvement. So I'll walk you through a number of items there, and there's a lot of moving pieces that take us from the 9% to 11%. But as I say, there are a number of important ones that we can point to operationally that are really driving this improvement that I think, based on the second half of this year, we have confidence in this as we move forward."

I think one particular thing about our business is that we are not a position preferred product in those regions, and we are a hospital necessity. So we're talking about infusion, we're talking about dialysis, and those products are needed. So we have seen price pressure in those markets, but we probably saw that ahead of many people because the nature of the products. So we feel that the risk of those markets for Baxter deteriorating further is pretty low. With all that said, it's our responsibility to look at portfolios in those countries and make sure they are selling the right products to the right markets. And we're going through that process as we speak. But in terms of the headlines that Baxter is, those are necessity products in hospital settings, and we've seen most of the contraction already. I'm not saying that we're not going to have them in the future, but we are not a physician-preferred product company in those markets. So I feel very comfortable that our strategy, at the moment, is solid. But going forward, rest assured, we're going to look at every region and  every country to make sure that the business we have are profitable and have good prospects going forward."

It is not an easy market to get in because the technology has to be absolutely perfect for bringing this therapy to the home. But we think we have the right technology, and we're working very hard to refine the technology. Right now, we already have kicked off our U.S. clinical trial for this year, and we're excited about that. In Europe, we have early patients, and we're learning very quickly about our VIVIA platform, and the use of this advice is proving to be well received in Europe. So we like our technology. It is an area that I will call is in a strategic bet [ph] and why is it strategic? Because it's high-end market growth, potential for good revenue per patient, but more so, the therapy itself is absolutely fantastic for the hemodialysis patient to be able to do this at home.

That's an overstatement in terms of the impact on gross -- on operating margin. On plan, it's about 60 basis points, 6-0, which is closer to $60 million of on-plan benefit. But maybe taking a step back to talk about the overall impact of pension. Overall, we expect approximately a $0.14 benefit year-over-year from pension. $0.07 roughly of that relates to the retained stake contribution that we plan to make in the coming month or so. And then the remaining portion, there's a few different pieces. First, the actual discount rate used to measure the liability has increased and of the result of that is approximately a $0.035 benefit. Second, as we've evaluated our accounting for our pension plan, we made 3 adjustments. One is we updated the mortality table that we're using. The second is we're now employing the recently approved methodology for accounting for discount rate and that's a benefit. And then the return on asset assumption is an item that we've lowered. So those 3 accounting changes that we've made impact us positively by about $0.02. And then we have some amortized losses that are rolling off, so that's about $0.01. So in combination, we're talking about a $0.14 year-over-year impact. And importantly, this counteracts some of the negatives like the lack of sundry and [ph] income that we experienced in 2016, along with the significant headwind on foreign exchange. But overall, the pension impact is in that order of magnitude."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before commenting on our performance in the fourth quarter, I wanted to share a few initial impressions about what I have observed during the past several weeks and why I'm excited about the opportunities that lay ahead.
Clearly, we're building on a very strong foundation. Baxter has established one of the most trusted and respected brands in the health care industry. And over this rich history, we have built a durable portfolio of market-leading products whose broad geography reach that spans more than 100 countries. Clearly, we have an outstanding base for expanding margins and accelerating performance. And following last year's spin-off of Baxalta, we can now devote our attention to these strategies and investments that will drive profitable growth across the business and create value as we aspire to deliver top quartile total shareholder returns for our investors.
The initial steps are already well underway, which is reflecting Baxter's fourth quarter results. As you saw in this morning's release, we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Operating income, up 10.7%, compared favorably to our guidance of 9.5% to 10%. After adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and the generic market entrant in the U.S. for cyclophosphamide, we reported sales growth of 4% in the quarter, also ahead of our expectations.
Key growth drivers in the quarter included a strong performance in our U.S. Fluid Systems franchise, while our nearly launched SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump continues to build momentum as well as increase the demand and favorable pricing for our IV solutions. Performance was also augmented by strength in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, which reported the highest quarterly growth of the year. The U.S. PD business has seen very promising early results on the recent launch of our AMIA APD cycler, which features our SHARESOURCE 2-way connectivity platform, and we look forward to expanding this launch in 2016.
So overall, a positive quarter and a great base to build on for the future. As for what the future looks like, we are in the process of developing a strategic framework that will shape our priorities and direct our approach in investments moving forward. I'm confident this framework will drive sustainable growth for Baxter and could enhance the value for our shareholders.
Simply put, our objective is to further accelerate and increase the impact of our margin improvement plans to support our goal of top quartile shareholder return. To successfully achieve this outcome, we will execute on 3 distinct strategic vectors, [ph] including portfolio optimization, operational excellence and capital allocation.
In terms of portfolio optimization, we'll take a dispassionate approach to portfolio management, which we include categorizing our businesses based on the existing financial profile and future potential. And accordingly, we will reallocate investments based on the ability to drive innovation. In addition, we're intensifying our focus on both R&D velocity and productivity to support our top and bottom line growth initiatives.
The second area of strategic focus is operational excellence. We are aggressively examining our cost structure in terms of how we do business for manufacturing and operations to commercial and corporate infrastructure. I am confident we can take additional cost out of our business without compromising our commitment to quality and safety. Related to this, we also ensure our capital expenditures are optimally allocated to projects that enhance bottom line growth and support long-term value creation.
And the final strategic focus area for us is capital allocation where we are committed to deploying capital in a manner that creates value over both the short and long term. We'll be sharing more information about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on May 9 in New York City. At that meeting, we'll provide more specifics around our objectives along with our 3- and 5-year aspirational financial targets. We know there is a lot of hard work in front of us, but our team is energized and well prepared for the road ahead.
And with that, I will pass it to Jay for more details on our fourth quarter performance and outlook for 2016. Then we'll have time at the end for questions. Jay?"
254571,321466063,924820,"Baxter International Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the second -- in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from",1947,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the second -- in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from strong operational performance on our Fluid Systems, PD and acute businesses as well as operating expense savings resulting from our disciplined management of costs and the restructuring initiative we announced last quarter. In addition, other income from foreign exchange related gains and a favorable tax rate both contributed to outperformance in the quarter.
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2016. Starting with sales, worldwide revenues of $2.6 billion increased 2% on a constant currency basis. This performance compared favorably to our Q4 guidance of a 1% sales decline with better-than-expected sales growth observed across the portfolio, particularly in our Fluid Systems, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions and Renal franchises.
Including the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 7% on a reported basis. And excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and U.S. cyclophosphamide, Baxter's sales rose 4% globally. Sales in the U.S. increased 1% on a reported basis, and after adjusting for cyclophosphamide, U.S. sales advanced 7%. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 2% and declined 12% on a reported basis.
Turning now to the drivers of business performance in the quarter. Please note, I will be speaking to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchises to provide a clearer picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance.
Starting with Hospital Products. Global sales totaled $1.6 billion and increased 2%. And after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide, sales for the Hospital Products business increased 5%. Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales of $569 million advanced 12%. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth of more than 20% in the infusion systems business, supported by the successful launch of our next-generation SIGMA Spectrum pump and the related Access sets pull through. In addition, sales of IV Solutions in the quarter benefited from favorable pricing and demand, particularly in the United States.
Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $595 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Excluding U.S. cyclo sales, revenues in the category increased 8%, driven by strength across the franchise, which includes our nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Fourth quarter U.S. cyclo sales totaled $65 million, representing a benefit of approximately $10 million versus our previous guidance. For the full year, U.S. cyclo sales totaled approximately $270 million.
Fourth quarter revenues in Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and BioSurgery products, totaled $346 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Performance benefited from low single-digit growth of our anesthesia business and core surgical sealant and hemostasis products, which both increased in line with surgical procedure volume growth. This performance was offset by lower sales of select noncore BioSurgery products.
Finally, sales in the BioPharma Solutions and other category, which is our former partnering [ph] business, totaled $109 million and as expected, declined 22%. As we previously highlighted, this decline is driven by a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. As we mentioned last quarter, this category also reflects sales for products Baxter is manufacturing on behalf of Baxalta, which totaled approximately $13 million in the quarter.
Turning to the Renal business. Global renal sales totaled $984 million, representing an increase of 1%. Performance in the quarter was driven by high single digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business. As Joe mentioned, we're very excited about the prospects for this business, which will benefit from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler.
In addition, we experienced low teens growth globally in our acute business, driven by underlying market growth and an increased adoption of continuous renal replacement therapy as a treatment option for acute kidney injuries. Growth in the Renal business was offset by lower sales in our in-center chronic hemodialysis business, resulting from our previously discussed decision to forgo certain lower-margin sales opportunities, along with competitive pressures for dialyzers.
Turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 42.6%, slightly ahead of our expectations, driven by favorable product mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $672 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 11%, reflecting the benefit of the initial actions we have taken to rebase our cost structure and reduce discretionary expenses and the impact from transition service income we receive from Baxalta during the quarter, which totaled approximately $30 million.
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $158 million increased 2% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted R&D expenditures increased 9% as we balanced increased investments to support our new product pipeline with efforts to optimize our overall R&D spend. Consistent with our portfolio optimization priorities, during the quarter, we made the decision to discontinue the development of select programs and as a result, absorbed approximately $15 million in expenses related to these decisions.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.7%, which compared favorably to our guidance of 9.5% to 10%, driven by the positive gross margin mix and SG&A savings I just referenced. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we'll continue to streamline our operations and control spending to drive ongoing margin expansion. Interest expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter.
Last week, we executed our first transaction with respect to the retained Baxalta stage. In this transaction, we exchanged approximately 38 million Baxalta shares or approximately 28% of the total original equity stake to retire $1.45 billion of indebtedness under one of our bank lines. Over the next several months, we'll look to further deploy the remaining Baxalta equity through a combination of additional debt-for-equity and equity-for-equity exchanges as well as make a contribution of at least $600 million worth of equity to our U.S. qualified pension plan subject to final regulatory approval.
Our goal is to exit our retained equity position prior to any shareholder vote for the Baxalta-Shire transaction to minimize the risk of any potential negative tax implications. And we have an agreement in place with Shire and Baxalta to assist with the orderly disposition of the stake. For 2016, we expect these retained stake related actions to benefit our earnings by approximately $0.15 per diluted share.
In terms of key balance sheet items, after giving effect to the extinguishment of the bank line, our current gross outstanding debt balance is approximately $5 billion, and cash on hand at the end of 2015 totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Other income totaled $36 million and included a foreign exchange gain from hedges on balance sheet positions of approximately $20 million and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake.
The adjusted tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter. This compared favorably to our guidance and contributed approximately $0.02 to our earnings per share in the quarter. The lower tax rate was driven by the extension of the R&D tax credit, a slight shift in our sales mix and certain other adjustments. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per share.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant currency basis, we expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase 2% to 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclo impact, we expect underlying growth of 3% to 4%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to decline approximately 1%. This is driven by growth in the Hospital Products business, up 2% to 3%, or 4% to 5% excluding U.S. cyclo. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of 6% to 8% for Fluid Systems, driven by strength in the U.S. business, partially offset by the International business where we continue our efforts to optimize our geographic footprint for this franchise.
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline mid-single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclo. 
For full year 2016, we anticipate at least 2 additional competitive entrants, specifically one to enter midyear and the second to enter towards the latter part of 2016. As a result, we expect U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to total approximately $180 million, representing a $90 million year-over-year decline. Sales for the category after adjusting for cyclophosphamide are expected to be comparable to prior years.
I would also remind you that in 2015, we recognized approximately $40 million in government sales for Protopam. Given the purchasing pattern associated with this product, we do not anticipate any sales in 2016 in IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 2% to 3%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect the other category, which includes our BioPharma Solutions franchise, to increase low double digits as we anniversary the impact of our customer transitioning their manufacturing in-house. This also reflects an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $25 million associated with contract manufacturing revenues from Baxalta.
For the Renal business, we expect full year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses and a stabilization in our in-center HD business.
Moving down the P&L. We expect an operating margin of approximately 11%, which compares favorably to the guidance we provided at our 2015 May investor conference of approximately 10%. We expect interest expense to total approximately $90 million. This reflects the recent extinguishment of our bank line, along with additional debt repayment, based on further utilization of the routine stake.
For 2016, we expect modest other income of approximately $10 million. This represents a year-over-year decline of approximately $150 million. In 2015, we benefited from certain balance sheet hedge gain and select equity gains related to our Baxter Ventures portfolio, neither of which is planned to repeat in 2016.
For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of 19.5% to 20%. This represents an increase from 2015, driven primarily by the change in earnings mix.
For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 540 million shares. This reduction is driven by equity-for-equity exchanges that we anticipate to execute as part of our routine stake strategy later in the second quarter.
Please note that our interest expense and share count guidance reflects a preliminary base case retained stake execution plan and is subject to change as we reassess the optimal size and mix of our remaining transactions as market and other conditions evolve. We anticipate providing updates to our guidance and/or additional detail around the actual impacts of our retained stake transaction as appropriate as we move forward.
Based on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share for 2016.
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million resulting in free cash flow from -- for 2016 of approximately $500 million. This is also favorable to the guidance we provided in May.
Specific to the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to decline approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

When, also, we look at execution, we need to continue to improve our execution on a global basis and make sure that we are in the right businesses around the globe. Being global is not to be all over the place, so we need to make sure that we focus in countries and geographies for businesses that make sense. So all this work is in process as we speak. When you look at -- on the cost base and expense, we want to take the company to a rebates exercise, cost rebates, and find out what is the appropriate level of support that we need to maintain our company and provide for continuous improvement and operational excellence programs that will deliver better results that we have spoken about in terms of operating income back in May last year. So we are working very diligently right now in creating this strategic framework. We're working on our portfolio initiatives. But we understand, some of these initiatives in the top line take a little longer. And I have no issues, augmenting that with some acquisitions, and I have no problems accelerating our cost reduction rebasing across the company to be able to create momentum until we can get the innovation we're seeing reignited again."

So there are a number of different variables that have impacted our performance since we sat together in May. I'll highlight maybe the 4 most significant. As you -- as David pointed out, we guided to an operating margin of 10% for 2016. Obviously, we're very pleased to report our expectations now are an 11% operating income margin. One of the key drivers relates to foreign exchange. The foreign exchange environment since May has moved very significantly. We can talk later about EPS impacts. But from an operating margin impact relative to our May expectations, we're down about 1.4% in terms of margin impact due to foreign exchange. As you recall, in the second half of the year, a lot of the emerging markets currencies moved while the developing market currencies stabilized. And for us, because we don't hedge emerging market currencies, it did have a 1.4% impact on our overall margin. We did have higher-than-expected cyclo in 2016, so as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we'll achieve about $180 million of cyclo sales in 2016. That's roughly 1 percentage point higher than we expected. We also have positive pension. There are a number of impacts that we have with respect to our pension, some of which we had anticipated in part related to the contribution of the retained stake, but some of which we did not anticipate. And that's about 60 basis points of improvement as we move to 2016. But I will tell you, the area that's most important as we look at the stability of the operations, from my perspective, relates to the operational performance and OpEx savings, which contribute about 1 point of margin improvement relative to our May investor conference expectations. So those are the 4 factors with cyclo and pension essentially offsetting FX and then the overachievement, really, in my view, coming from operational strength."

I would say to you, I'm going to give a few examples. We have a very good IPS business. The Integrated Pharmacy Solutions is a very good business and is something that we probably can double down. As an example, we'll be making organic investments, possibly inorganic investments. I just want to circle back to your comment about large-size M&A. When we go down this path, and we look at inorganic opportunities, size is now what matters. But the ability, the ability to change the weighted average market gross rate of our businesses is key to us. And those acquisitions will be singles and doubles. They will not be big things at one shot. We're going to make right decisions with our shareholders' money. And we need to balance that well, but we need to make sure also that we can successfully integrate and generate a step change in how we grow that business that we acquired. So we'll be focusing a great deal of our attention in the value that business brings to us that's strategic, but IPS is a good place to start."

I mean, look, we were -- we have -- Fluid Systems really has 2 primary drivers of growth in the fourth quarter and then also as we move to next year, we'll see similar levels of performance in -- based on those 2 drivers. And the first one, I would say, is the infusion systems business. In particular, in the U.S., we had well north of 20% growth in our infusion systems business. And breaking that down, there's 2 components of that. One is the sale of the Spectrum pump, which has recently relaunched and that clearly is capital related. But as I think about the long-term sustainability of the business, really, we were very pleased with the sets associated with that as we had very strong performance in set sales as well, well into double digits. So those were the 2 drivers on the infusion system side. From an IV therapy standpoint, we commented previously about the conditions, the marketplace conditions, some of the actions that we've taken and also continued demand for this important product. And so we did report very solid growth in the IV therapy business as well, well into double digits. And so in combination, these items contributed to, in the U.S. and my growth rates are in relation to the U.S. The Fluid Systems growth that we reported of 27%. So clearly, this was a bright spot for us. We do expect this to continue, but of course, not at the Q4 rates. So we'll see some moderation as we move to the 2016 plan. So overall, we're very pleased with it. Some of it is related to capital spending. But as you know, most hospitals have lacked, for many years, an attractive alternative from a pump standpoint for a variety of different reasons. So we do believe there is some level of pent-up demand. We have a fairly good line of sight, the sales plan for 2016, so this is an area add that I think is really one of the growth drivers for Baxter in 2016 and beyond."

From the retained stake standpoint, there are 2 things that are very clear to us today. First, as you know, we're in the process of finalizing the bank line transaction, which is going to reduce our gross debt by $1.45 billion. That will be completed imminently. The second item is, in this quarter, we expect to contribute more than $600 million in equity to our pension plan. That, of course, is subject to Department of Labor approval. So those things are, in my view, very definitive. As we move on to the remaining transactions, our preliminary plan is to pursue 2 additional transactions. One is an equity-for-debt exchange and the second is an equity-for-equity split off. We currently expect to pursue the debt exchange early in Q2 and the equity exchange closer to midyear. There's going to be a number of factors that lead us to finally size these transactions, but you're right. From a placeholder standpoint, our current view is that we'll use, at Baxalta's current price, a little more than $2 billion to retire debt and a little less than $1 billion to retire equity. But as I said before, these transactions are subject to market conditions, optimal pricing and our objective is to maximize long-term value and optimize economics with respect to these transactions. So as far as definitive plans, I can tell you, these are our very preliminary plans but by no means definitive. We're evaluating what the optimal mix is, so there may be changes to these transactions as we move forward based on the receptivity of the market and a number of other factors. As we finalize plans and execute transactions, clearly, we'll update guidance. But we have enough information today to share with you these preliminary estimates, which provide sort of some balance around the guidance range that we're given. In combination, we expect about a $0.15 benefit this year. There would be some increase to next year in part because the equity-for-equity transaction would occur very close to midyear in this planned assumption and also, the equity-for-debt exchange, we'll have at least a quarter more of benefit rolling into 2017."

So you touched on a number of things that you talked about in San Francisco, including portfolio optimization and improving R&D productivity, improving the overall growth, exit a business and being in the top quartile of shareholder returns. The big part of that is putting this Baxalta stake and ultimately, your balance sheet, to work to create value. You talked about doing more likely a series of smaller deals to achieve those objectives. As you think about that, is the #1 priority to accelerate the overall mix of growth in the company's end markets? Or should we look at it as more ROIC-driven or margin-driven? Maybe just help us think about if you're looking -- if you have targets and if you're looking to do something particularly for the company, is it accelerating the top line?

So what can we do to change the trajectory of the company's top line growth and bottom line? What comes first? So we need to -- we already have embarked on this very extensive operational excellence program to cut costs. We're going to double down on that and become a little bit more aggressive. That will create some momentum as we continue to look for the opportunities at the top line. When you talk about the capital allocation at top line, we have about 4, 5 businesses that we probably get a significant amount of investment from the company on the organic arena. I'm going to talk more about that in May. I don't want to preempt to that now. But also, we're going to invest inorganically in opportunities for those businesses. When we talk about how to hit it well, we want to change -- we want to buy business that are growing faster than our current base business. That is a pretty obvious thing. Second thing is if we can combine that with a good synergistic deal, we'll do it as well. And why do I put a bracket around very large deals? Because very large deals are very difficult to find. We can keep looking for a deal like that. It will take a couple of years versus just creating really good strategy by looking at adjacencies and tapping good businesses with acquisitions that make sense. I don't discuss size being large. But I just think it's much more difficult to encounter that than something else that will create value for almost instantly and you can execute a little faster. So I'm looking at this whole thing as a journey where we make sure that our cost is in place while augment our internal innovation and supplement internal innovation with some really well thought-out acquisitions."

There is an important point to make, which is -- and you know it's about our business, Bob. We have seasonality, which typically, the second half of the year is stronger than the first half, and the fourth quarter is typically one of the strongest margin quarters that we have in large part because of incremental sales performance that naturally occurs. And so as we think about margin performance next year versus this year, I do think it's important to look at the entire year holistically. And if you think about the full year for 2015, we're adding about approximately a 9% margin going to the 11% that we've guided to. So it is a fairly substantial step change improvement in margin. The other point I will make is our Q1 guidance does have the lowest margin of the year. Again, in part driven by the fact that Q1 sales are typically the lightest. I mean, because of all the fixed cost we have in place, there is some absorption that does not occur due to the lower level of sales. So I think those are a couple of important points. By and large, we're very pleased with the margin improvement that this plan indicates. The second half of the year was very important for us in large part because it gave us confidence that we could give solid guidance for 2016 and that we could operate effectively on a standalone basis. But I do think it's important to consider the seasonality and the trending in margin when we think about 2016."

Foreign exchange is about a 1.6-point on a year-over-year basis margin drag, so it's a very substantial -- relative to May at the last -- on a year-over-year basis, it's even more than that. The pension, again, is about 1 point of improvement year-over-year. But then, there a number of other critical items and again, these are the ones that I'm happiest to point out. SG&A savings, we're talking about a 2 percentage point improvement in SG&A. R&D savings, we're talking about a 60-basis-point improvement. And then operationally, because many of the initiatives that we're putting in place from a mix volume standpoint, along with some of our pricing and economic value capture initiatives, along with general business growth, yields approximately a little more than 1 percentage point of margin improvement. So I'll walk you through a number of items there, and there's a lot of moving pieces that take us from the 9% to 11%. But as I say, there are a number of important ones that we can point to operationally that are really driving this improvement that I think, based on the second half of this year, we have confidence in as we move forward."

We need to bring the leverage at the same time that we invest, meaning, we need to accelerate some of our cost reductions. Period. Secondly, our spending in R&D today is adequate for the portfolio as we see in the near and midterm. Meaning, we don't need to spend more money than we're spending today as a matter of mix. And if we need to spend more money, we need to self-fund that and make sure that, that does not impact our earnings. So this is not an investment story where we have an R&D -- a budget that is completely underfunded to deliver an innovation. We just need to do a better job in allocating capital to the right franchise to have the chance to grow faster. So I had measured [ph], for instance, IPS. We'll double down that in IPS to be able to get more molecules to the marketplace. So we're working on plans like this very rapidly. But that is a reallocation of resources. I want to make sure investors are clear that as we work to accelerate our cost reductions to provide for improved bottom line, we will create a mix change in how we spend money to be able to invest in the right things and concurrently look at some good acquisitions that will come in and create a momentum in changing our weighted average market growth rate."

The result of that, of course, is you have a lower drop through -- both in terms of margin and then ultimately in terms of EPS. And then, there is another factor, which is we do have a slightly larger FX impact in the first quarter than we do in later quarters in the year. So roughly 40% of the FX impact on a full year basis occurs in the first quarter of the year. So really, those would be the 2 items that I would point to.

That's an overstatement in terms of the impact on gross -- on operating margin. On plan, it's about 60 basis points, 6-0, which is closer to $60 million of on-plan benefit. But maybe taking a step back to talk about the overall impact of pension. Overall, we expect approximately a $0.14 benefit year-over-year from pension. $0.07 roughly of that relates to the retained stake contribution that we plan to make in the coming month or so. And then the remaining portion, there's a few different pieces. First, the actual discount rate used to measure the liability has increased and the result of that is approximately a $0.035 benefit. Second, as we've evaluated our accounting for our pension plan, we made 3 adjustments. One is we updated the mortality table that we're using. The second is we're now employing the recently approved methodology for accounting for discount rate and that's a benefit. And then the return on asset assumption is an item that we've lowered. So those 3 accounting changes that we've made impact us positively by about $0.02. And then we have some amortized losses that are rolling off, so that's about $0.01. So in combination, we're talking about a $0.14 year-over-year impact. And importantly, this counteracts some of the negatives like the lack of sundry income that we experienced in 2016, along with the significant headwind on foreign exchange. But overall, the pension impact is in that order of magnitude."

I'll provide some brief comments on performance before turning it over to Jay for additional details and an update on our full year outlook. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A. 
So let's get started. Worldwide sales grew 4% on constant currency basis and decreased to 1% on a reported basis. Operational growth was at the high end of our guidance, and we're pleased with the sequential quarterly improvement in sales growth for total Baxter within both the Renal and Hospital Products segments. 
Sales growth was primarily driven by strength in U.S. Fluid Systems and PD businesses, along with strong performance in acute renal service. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share. These results reflect the positive -- a positive sales mix continued expanding discipline and some favorability from foreign exchange versus previous guidance. 
Let me summarize performance by franchise. Please note that I'll be speaking to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchise to provide a clear picture of Baxter's underlying operational 
performance. 
Starting with Hospital Products. Global sales totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of 4%. 
As planned, first quarter sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide totaled $60 million and were similar to the prior period. As a result, sales of cyclophosphamide impacted growth tax rate for the quarter. 
With the Fluid Systems franchise, sales totaled $524 million, up 11%. Growth in the franchise was driven by strength in the U.S, supported by the continued successful launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump, as well as favorable pricing and demand for IV solutions in the U.S. 
We have successfully renegotiated all of our large GPO contracts, including the recent agreement with Health Rest. This contract built upon our partnership with U.S. customers that will ultimately allow us to serve more patients and position Baxter for continued growth. 
Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $556 million, an increase of 3%. After adjusting revenues for our government preparedness over last year, sales in the category increased 6%. Growth was driven by strength across the franchise, including nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. 
This category also includes cyclophosphamide, which as planned, did not impact growth in the quarter. 
Key to growth in our IPS business is a broadening our product offering. Last week, we launched VANCOMYCIN saline in the company's proprietary GALAXY flexible container, which enables unstable molecules to be premixed and ensures stability and operational efficiency at the point of care. VANCOMYCIN saline is the second of 9 molecules that we'll be introducing -- rather, we will be introducing over the next few years, and we recently submitted our third molecule for review with FDA. 
We also continue to expand our nutrition portfolio globally and recently announced the approval of our NUMETA G13 in U.K. and Denmark. This market represents the first of 20 countries where we look to launch this year. NUMETA G13 is a triple chamber parenteral nutrition product focused on meeting the specialized needs of preterm infants, Expanded the formulations of NUMETA will help address an underserved market segment. 
With the Surgical Care, which include -- which includes our anesthesia and BioSurgery products, first quarter revenues totaled $305 million, declining 2%. 
Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower sales of selected noncore BioSurgery products and weaker-than-expected international BioSurgery sales, partially offsetting this impact was mid-single-digit growth of both U.S. surgical sealant and hemostasis products as well as international anesthesia products where we continue to expand the market and capture share. Baxter is now the market leader globally for inhaled anesthetics. 
Surgical Care remains an attractive area, and we are prepared to accelerate the performance to innovation. In the first quarter, we received approvals for expanded indications for HEMOPATCH in the EU and FLOSEAL in Japan. Both offer great utility among surgeons using these hemostatic agents. 
Finally, sales in the other category, which is primarily our pharma business has totaled $92 million. As expected sales declined 14%, resulting from the large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. 
Turning to Renal. Global Renal sales totaled $898 million, up 5%, and we're pleased to see growth accelerates within this business. Performance in the quarter benefited from low double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business as we build on the momentum from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler. The launch is trending better than our expectations with more than 500 AMIA cycles sold in more than 100 patients in treatment. 
The feedback received from clinicians and patients has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly with respect to the benefits associated with our SHARESOURCE through a removed connectivity platform. We look forward to continue to expand this launch and increasingly adoption of home therapies in the U.S. 
The stand out from the quarter was global growth of nearly 20% of our Acute business, driven by increased adoption of extra portfolio therapies, including Baxter's continuous renal therapy for acute injuries. In the relation to underlying market growth, Baxter CRRT business continues to gain market share globally. 
In chronic and hemodialysis, we experienced low single digit growth, a positive reversal from the trend we experienced last year. 
With good momentum from our first quarter performance, the Baxter team is looking forward to our upcoming investor conference on May 9 in New York. We recently completed deep dive portfolio analysis across all businesses, which ash informed us how we must channel our investments within forward. We're well positioned to leverage our greatest opportunities and prepare to retool as necessary. 
I would also point out that we will be hosting an innovation fair prior to the start of the formal presentation, showcasing our exciting new products pipeline. I look forward to seeing many of you on the ninth. 
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then, we'll have some time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Operational sales growth, 4%, came in at the high end of our guidance range and including foreign exchange, sales declined 1%. Walking through the",895,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results. 
Operational sales growth, 4%, came in at the high end of our guidance range and including foreign exchange, sales declined 1%. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 42.3% compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing and a lower negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $620 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis. 
On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 13%, reflecting our ongoing focus on controlling spending and rebasing our cost structure. 
SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta of approximately $25 million in the quarter. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $136 million declined 5% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted R&D spend declined 2% as we continue to balance investment in key programs to support future growth, while reducing infrastructure-related expenses. 
Adjusted operating in the market in the quarter was 10.5% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by the positive gross margin and the operating savings I just referenced. 
Interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter. During this quarter, Baxter retired approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt through the utilization of a portion of our retained Baxalta equity in 2 debt-for-equity exchanges. 
Following these exchanges, the company's gross debt now totals approximately $3.4 billion and our net debt totals approximately $1.15 billion. 
At the end of the quarter, Baxter held 30.5 million Baxalta shares, and we intend to utilize this remaining equity through a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan an then equity-for-equity exchange, which was launched last week. 
We expect to complete utilization of all remaining Baxalta shares during the second quarter. 
Other income totaled $27 million and included foreign exchange gain on balance sheet position of approximately $10 million and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake. 
The adjusted tax rate was 19.8% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.28 to $0.30 per share. 
To decompose this favorability, it was driven by $0.04 of operational strength, $0.02 of benefit from other income and a lower foreign exchange headwinds, which contributed approximately $0.01 relative to original expectations. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying growth of approximately 4%. 
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 1%. 
We expect growth in Hospital Products business of approximately 3% or approximately 5%, excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we now expect sales growth of high single digits for Fluid Systems, driven by the continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we now expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide of $180 million remains unchanged and is based on the assumption that 2 additional competitors enter the market in 2016, the first, by mid-year; and the second, during the latter part of 2016. After adjusting for cyclo, sales are expected to increase low single digits. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we now anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%, reflecting softness we experienced in the first quarter. The growth trajectory for this category is expected to improve as we build upon new indications and geographic expansions. 
And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect the other category to increase 6% to 7%. 
For the Renal business, we continue to expect full year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and Acute businesses and stabilization in our in center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 11.5%, a 50 basis points improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting favorable sales mix, discipline management of expenses and a lower headwind from foreign exchange. 
We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $35 million. 
For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This represents an increase from our original guidance and is driven by incremental strength we're observing within our U.S. business. 
For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 545 million shares. 
Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share as compared to our original guidance of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share. 
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to now exceed $1.4 billion. We expect CapEx of approximately $900 million, which results in more than $500 million improved cash flow. 
Specifically, the second quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to increase approximately 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to include approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.38 to $0.40 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

It's clear, we're very proud of the progress that we made on spending. I think the first quarter is clear evidence of that. But as we move to the latter part of the year, there's a couple of things to be mindful of. First, the TSA income we started recording this in the second half of last year, so that benefit on a year-over-year basis goes away in the second half of the year. And then the second comment is, with respect to restructuring and spending, we did have some benefit in the latter part of last year as we started to implement controls very quickly after the spin-off. And so some of those benefits is not appropriately annualized that performance as we move forward. But it's safe to say, cost as a clear focus for us.

So from our perspective, we have a significant effort in connectivity, wired and wireless, and we have 2 new versions of our pumps coming up in the next 3 years, but we are working diligently on a global platform that we're going to probably have more news in about 6 months down the road. But we have a significant effort, it's a great opportunity for us.

Enabling depth feature doesn't mean that the adoption is going to be there. It just make shares at the hospital to hospital system has the ability to connect with the EMR. Not everyone is ready, but we will be ready as our customers become more diligent about using this feature.

So you have natural momentum of that. The second part is access to the patient. The selective markets in the world, Baxter will make an attempt to connect directly with patients. I have a great example in Canada where the government is really into the PD business. They think PD First is in good policy, not only for the patient, but in terms of the systems in terms of reimbursement and cost for the system, 60% penetration in Canada. So there are other opportunities in North America, and we are not happy not accessing the patient in North America. So we will have creative ways of connecting to the patient through payers, through providers to be able to increase the penetration of PD before increasing the future margins of this business. I have to say that when we look at the chronic renal -- the Acute Renal business, there is a phenomenal business for the company where we are going to probably launch a product platform in critical care based on extra portfolio therapies to accelerate even further the growth of that business, net improve margins."

Those run through the renal segments margins. That's a factor that will go away over time. Related to that, we'll have the benefit of new product launches at a premium price, which will allow us to take margin up in that sense. And then the final point I would make just tactically speaking is -- you'll recall at our investor conference last year, we did comment that there was 150 basis points of incremental manufacturing cost that would experience in the short-term as we look to address regulatory opportunities for us. That impacted our numbers in the second half of last year and all of 2015 and a large component of that related to the Renal business. We do expect some of these costs to sunset overtime.

But what I would say is, over time, we will expect significantly migrate towards AMIA. We're focused on new patient starts as opposed to flipping existing patients. That would be too disruptive. But over time, this will be a larger part of our U.S. business. Frankly, in short term, it's not going to be -- in 2016, it will not be a huge impact on our overall sales. But over the course of this long-range plan, I do expect this to feature very prominently for our company."

As you saw in our press release morning, we reported strong first quarter with both the top line and bottom line results exceeding our expectations. I will provide some brief comments on performance before turning it over to Jay for additional details and an update on our full year outlook. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A. 
So let's get started. Worldwide sales grew 4% on constant currency basis and decreased to 1% on a reported basis. Operational growth was at the high end of our guidance, and we're pleased with the sequential quarterly improvement in sales growth for total Baxter within both the Renal and Hospital Products segments. Sales growth was primarily driven by strength in U.S. Fluid Systems and PD businesses, along with strong performance in acute renal service. They delivered adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share. These results reflect the positive -- a positive sales mix, continued expanding discipline and some favorability from foreign exchange versus previous guidance. 
Let me summarize performance by franchise. Please note that I'll be speaking to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact, for each of the businesses and franchise to provide a clear picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance. Starting with Hospital Products. Global sales totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of 4%. As planned, first quarter sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide totaled $60 million and were similar to the prior period. As a result, sales of cyclophosphamide did not impact the growth rate for the quarter. 
Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales totaled $524 million, up 11%. Growth in the franchise was driven by strength in the U.S., supported by the continued successful launch of the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump as well as favorable pricing and demand for IV solutions in the U.S. We have successfully renegotiated all of our large GPO contracts, including a recent agreement with HealthTrust. This contract's built upon our partnership with U.S. customers that will ultimately allow us to serve more patients and position Baxter for continued growth. 
Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $556 million, an increase of 3%. After adjusting revenues for a government preparedness over last year, sales in the category increased 6%. Growth was driven by strength across the franchise, including nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. This category also includes cyclophosphamide, which, as planned, did not impact growth in the quarter. 
Key to growth in our IPS business is broadening our product offering. Last week, we launched VANCOMYCIN saline in the company's proprietary GALAXY flexible container, which enables unstable molecules to be premixed and ensures the sterility and operational efficiency at the point of care. VANCOMYCIN saline is the second of 9 molecules that we'll be introducing -- rather, we will be introducing over the next few years, and we recently submitted our third molecule for review with FDA. 
We also continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio globally and recently announced the approval of our NUMETA G13 in the U.K. and Denmark. These markets represent the first of 20 countries where we look to launch this year. NUMETA G13 is a triple chamber parenteral nutrition product focused on meeting the specialized needs of preterm infants. Expanding the formulations of NUMETA will help address an underserved market segment. 
With Surgical Care, which include -- which includes our anesthesia and BioSurgery products, first quarter revenues totaled $305 million, declining 2%. Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower sales of selected noncore BioSurgery products and weaker-than-expected international BioSurgery sales. Partially offsetting this impact was mid-single-digit growth of both U.S. surgical sealant and hemostasis products as well as international anesthesia products, where we continue to expand the market and capture share. Baxter is now the market leader globally for inhaled anesthetics. 
Surgical Care remains an attractive area, and we are prepared to accelerate performance through innovation. In the first quarter, we received approvals for expanded indications for HEMOPATCH in the EU and FLOSEAL in Japan. Both offer great utility among surgeons using these hemostatic agents. 
Finally, sales in the other category, which is primarily our pharma partnering business, has totaled $92 million. As expected, sales declined 14%, resulting from a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. 
Turning to Renal. Global Renal sales totaled $898 million, up 5%, and we're pleased to see growth accelerated within this business. Performance in the quarter benefited from low double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business as we built on the momentum from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler. The launch is trending better than our expectations with more than 500 AMIA cyclers sold in more than 100 patients in treatment. The feedback we received from clinicians and patients has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly with respect to the benefits associated with our SHARESOURCE through a removed connectivity platform. We look forward to continuing to expand this launch and increasing the adoption of home therapies in the U.S. 
A standout from the quarter was global growth of nearly 20% of our Acute business, driven by increased adoption of extra portfolio of therapies, including Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injuries. In addition to underlying market growth, Baxter's CRRT business continues to gain market share globally. And in chronic and hemodialysis, we experienced low single digit growth, a positive reversal from the trend we experienced last year. 
With good momentum from our first quarter performance, the Baxter team is looking forward to our upcoming Investor Conference on May 9 in New York. We have recently completed deep dive portfolio analysis across all businesses, which has informed us how we must channel our investments moving forward. We're well positioned to leverage our greatest opportunities and prepare to retool where necessary. I will -- I would also point out that we'll be hosting an innovation fair prior to the start of the formal presentation, showcasing our exciting new product pipeline. I look forward to seeing many of you on the ninth. 
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we'll have some time at the end for questions. Jay?"

Operational sales growth of 4% came in at the high end of our guidance range, and including foreign exchange, sales declined 1%. Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 42.3% compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing and a lower negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $620 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 13%, reflecting our ongoing focus on controlling spending and rebasing our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta of approximately $25 million in the quarter. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $136 million declined 5% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted R&D spend declined 2% as we continue to balance investment in key programs to support future growth while reducing infrastructure-related expenses. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.5% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by the positive gross margin and the operating savings I just referenced. Interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, Baxter retired approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt through the utilization of a portion of our retained Baxalta equity in 2 debt-for-equity exchanges. Following these exchanges, the company's gross debt now totals approximately $3.4 billion and our net debt totals approximately $1.15 billion. 
At the end of the quarter, Baxter held 30.5 million Baxalta shares, and we intend to utilize this remaining equity through a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan and an equity-for-equity exchange, which was launched last week. We expect to complete utilization of all remaining Baxalta shares during the second quarter. 
Other income totaled $27 million and included foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $10 million and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake. The adjusted tax rate was 19.8% for the quarter. 
And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.28 to $0.30 per share. To decompose this favorability, it was driven by $0.04 of operational strength, $0.02 of benefit from other income and a lower foreign exchange headwind, which contributed approximately $0.01 relative to original expectations. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying growth of approximately 4%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 1%. 
We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of approximately 3% or approximately 5%, excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we now expect sales growth of high single digits for Fluid Systems, driven by the continued strength in the U.S. business. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we now expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide of $180 million remains unchanged and is based on the assumption that 2 additional competitors enter the market in 2016: the first, by mid-year; and the second, during the latter part of 2016. After adjusting for cyclo, sales are expected to increase low single digits. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we now anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we experienced in the first quarter. The growth trajectory for this category is expected to improve as we build upon new indications and geographic expansions. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect the other category to increase 6% to 7%. 
For the Renal business, we continue to expect full year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and Acute businesses and the stabilization in our in-center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 11.5%, a 50 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting favorable sales mix, disciplined management of expenses and a lower headwind from foreign exchange. We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $35 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This represents an increase from our original guidance and is driven by incremental strength we're observing within our U.S. business. For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 545 million shares. 
Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share as compared to our original guidance of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share. Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to now exceed $1.4 billion. We expect CapEx of approximately $900 million, which results in more than $500 million improved cash flow. 
Specific to the second quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency, to increase approximately 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.38 to $0.40 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

Look, the -- I think both Joe and I would very quickly acknowledge that 9% of sales for a company of our nature is too high. There are elements that we have to consider as we think about the Baxter business, but there is clear opportunity for us over our long-range plan horizon to improve CapEx spending and to reduce it to a number that is below the 9%. One thing I would point out, Mike, that we didn't really discuss in detail on the fourth quarter call is when we were meeting with you all in May, we highlighted $900 million, on average, for CapEx over the long-range plan, but we did say that the early years would be above the $900 million, implying a number closer to $950 million in the first year of the plan. But we were very pleased with some of the 0-based activity that we did on the CapEx budget to reduce CapEx spending to start the year. And then as we move forward, this is going to be a continued area of focus for us, and our full intent is to drive this down over the plan."

It's clear, we're very proud of the progress that we've made on spending, and I think the first quarter is clear evidence of that. But as we move to the latter part of the year, there's a couple of things to be mindful of. First, the TSA income. We started recording this in the second half of last year. So that benefit on a year-over-year basis goes away in the second half of the year. And then the second comment is, with respect to restructuring and spending, we did have some benefit in the latter part of last year as we started to implement controls very quickly after the spin-off. And so some of those benefits, it's not appropriate to annualize that performance as we move forward. But it's safe to say, cost is a clear focus for us.

They are in the pipeline, and we're going to accelerate them as much as we can as the ability to be approved by the FDA. In terms of technology, we do a great job on that. So logical extension of that would be to go in an area that -- strengthening those for competencies. Now I can't speak from prior -- no, about prior management's strategic decisions. But when I look at this, I see there's a natural migration of our business. Now the competencies to manage a business like this are slightly different.

So from our perspective, we have a significant effort in connectivity, wired and wireless, and we have new -- 2 new versions of our pumps coming out in the next 3 years. But we also working diligently on a global platform that we're going to probably have more news in about 6 months down the road. But we have a significant effort. It's a great opportunity for us. And as we continue to gain market share in our infusion systems, you will see us coming up with new pump versions that will enable that feature. Enabling of the feature doesn't mean that the adoption is going to be there. It just makes sure that the hospital, the hospital system has the ability to connect with the EMR. Not everyone is ready, and -- but we will be ready as our customers become more diligent about using this feature.

And we -- as we have new technology coming about, Theranova, we'll -- hopefully, we'll be able to see that trend being steady. the -- so you have the natural momentum of that. The second part is access to the patient. In selective markets in the world, Baxter will make an attempt to connect direct with the patients. I have a great example in Canada, where the government is really into the PD business. They think PD First is in good policy, not only for the patient, but also for the systems in terms of reimbursement and cost for the system, 60% penetration in Canada. So there are other opportunities in North America, and we're not happy not accessing the patient in North America. So we will have creative ways of connecting to the patient through payers, through providers to be able to increase the penetration of PD, therefore, increasing the future margins of this business. I have to say that when we look at the chronic renal -- the Acute Renal business, that is a phenomenal business for the company, where we're going to probably launch a platform in critical care, based on extra portfolio of therapies, to accelerate even further the growth of that business, thus [ph]  Improve margins."

One is we have been investing in a number of R&D programs over the last year, so VIVIA, AMIA, along with PrisMAX, which are 3 major platform developments. That -- those run through the Renal segment's margins. So that's a factor that will go away over time. Related to that, we'll have the benefit of new product launches at a premium price, which will allow us to take margin up in that sense. And then the final point I would make, just tactically speaking, is you'll recall at our Investor Conference last year, we did comment that there was 150 basis points of incremental manufacturing cost that we'd experience in the short term as we look to address some regulatory opportunities for us. That impacted our numbers in the second half of last year and all of 2015, and a large component of that related to the Renal business. We do expect some of these costs to sunset over time. So in addition to the strategic component that Joe walked you through, I think there are a number of tactical elements that will also support margin in this business."

We're not going to show you everything, but we're going to show a portion of what we think the future holds for Baxter and a significant amount of R&D innovation that is coming through the pipeline. So our commitment to R&D is very strong. We have done and continue to do efficiency programs in R&D in terms of consolidation of sites and infrastructure. Infrastructure does not provide innovation. What provides innovation are people in the right places, developing products for unmet needs and also applications for a specific market. And so what you see in terms of reduction in R&D is more of a realignment of resources across the globe in the right focus and the right products. We're starting to do capital allocation, so we're going to see some movement in R&D, going to see some projects that will be slow down, some that will be doubled down to be able to accelerate. In terms of hard-to-manufacture APIs, we have some capabilities in-house. But we always have, at our disposal, the ability to partner with companies across the globe and acquire companies across the globe. As you know, our balance sheet has good capacity, and we'll be putting that to work for the shareholders' interest. And one of them is the ability to capitalize on our injectable core competencies."

So it's essentially a $0.14 improvement in terms of EPS. Contributing -- there are a number of factors that contribute to that. One is foreign exchange. There's approximately $0.06 of benefit from foreign exchange that we expect to see in the remaining part or over the course of the year. The second piece, though, and frankly, this is the one that I think we're happiest about, relates to operational performance. Our expectation now is that, operationally, we will be $0.06 better than our original expectations. And then there's a number of other puts and takes. Interest and other income related to equity gains and balance sheet gains is approximately $0.04, and that offsets tax rate and share count, which is a negative -- roughly negative $0.03 or $0.04. So those are the primary drivers of the performance. But I would highlight that from our standpoint, as we think about the work that we're doing, both on the cost side and pricing and the mix side, a lot of those margin improvement efforts that we're undertaking, those are reflected in the $0.06 of operational overachievement that I highlighted."

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website. 
Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Conference on May 9 in New York City. At the conference, we will be providing an update on our strategic and financial aspirations along with showcasing our innovative new product pipeline at an innovation fair. More details, along with the link to register for the event, can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

As you saw in our press release morning, we reported strong first quarter with both the top line and bottom line results exceeding our expectations. I will provide some brief comments on performance before turning it over to Jay for additional details and an update on our full year outlook. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A. 
So let's get started. Worldwide sales grew 4% on constant-currency basis and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Operational growth was at the high end of our guidance, and we're pleased with the sequential quarterly improvement in sales growth for total Baxter within both the Renal and Hospital Products segments. Sales growth was primarily driven by strength in U.S. Fluid Systems and PD businesses, along with strong performance in acute renal service. They delivered adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share. These results reflect the positive -- a positive sales mix, continued expanding discipline and some favorability from foreign exchange versus previous guidance. 
Let me summarize performance by franchise. Please note that I'll be speaking to sales growth on a constant-currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchise to provide a clear picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance. 
Starting with Hospital Products. Global sales totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of 4%. As planned, first quarter sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide totaled $60 million and were similar to the prior period. As a result, sales of cyclophosphamide did not impact the growth rate for the quarter. 
Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales totaled $524 million, up 11%. Growth in the franchise was driven by strength in the U.S., supported by the continued successful launch of the SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump as well as favorable pricing and demand for IV solutions in the U.S. We have successfully renegotiated all of our large GPO contracts, including a recent agreement with HealthTrust. These contracts built upon our partnership with U.S. customers that will ultimately allow us to serve more patients and position Baxter for continued growth. 
Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $556 million, an increase of 3%. After adjusting revenues for government preparedness over last year, sales in the category increased 6%. Growth was driven by strength across the franchise, including nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. This category also includes cyclophosphamide, which, as planned, did not impact growth in the quarter. 
Key to growth in our IPS business is broadening our product offering. Last week, we launched VANCOMYCIN saline in the company's proprietary GALAXY flexible container, which enables unstable molecules to be premixed and ensures the sterility and operational efficiency at the point of care. VANCOMYCIN saline is the second of 9 molecules that we'll be introducing -- rather, we will be introducing over the next few years, and we recently submitted our third molecule for review with FDA. 
We also continue to expand our nutrition portfolio globally and recently announced the approval of our NUMETA G13 in the U.K. and Denmark. These markets represent the first of 20 countries where we look to launch this year. NUMETA G13 is a triple chamber parenteral nutrition product focused on meeting the specialized needs of preterm infants. Expanding the formulations of NUMETA will help address an underserved market segment. 
With this Surgical Care, which include -- which includes our anesthesia and BioSurgery products, first quarter revenues totaled $305 million, declining 2%. Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower sales of selected noncore BioSurgery products and weaker-than-expected international BioSurgery sales. Partially offsetting this impact was mid-single-digit growth of both U.S. surgical sealant and hemostasis products as well as international anesthesia products, where we continue to expand the market and capture share. Baxter is now the market leader globally for inhaled anesthetics. 
Surgical Care remains an attractive area, and we are prepared to accelerate performance through innovation. In the first quarter, we received approvals for expanded indications for HEMOPATCH in the EU and FLOSEAL in Japan. Both offer great utility among surgeons using these hemostatic agents. 
Finally, sales in the Other category, which is primarily our pharma partnering business, has totaled $92 million. As expected, sales declined 14%, resulting from a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. 
Turning to Renal. Global Renal sales totaled $898 million, up 5%, and we're pleased to see growth accelerate within this business. Performance in the quarter benefited from low double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business as we built on the momentum from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler. The launch is trending better than our expectations with more than 500 AMIA cyclers sold and more than 100 patients in treatment. The feedback we received from clinicians and patients has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly with respect to the benefits associated with our SHARESOURCE 2-way remote connectivity platform. We look forward to continuing to expand this launch and increasing the adoption of home therapies in the U.S. 
A standout from the quarter was global growth of nearly 20% of our acute business, driven by increased adoption of extra portfolio therapies, including Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injuries. In addition to underlying market growth, Baxter's CRRT business continues to gain market share globally. And in chronic and hemodialysis, we experienced low single digit growth, a positive reversal from the trend we experienced last year. 
With good momentum from our first quarter performance, the Baxter team is looking forward to our upcoming investor conference on May 9 in New York. We've recently completed deep-dive portfolio analysis across all businesses, which has informed us how we must channel our investments moving forward. We're well positioned to leverage our greatest opportunities and prepare to retool where necessary. I will -- I would also point out that we'll be hosting an innovation fair prior to the start of the formal presentation, showcasing our exciting new product pipeline. I look forward to seeing many of you on the 9th. 
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we'll have some time at the end for questions. Jay?"
254571,329405557,963274,"Baxter International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Operational sales growth of 4% came in at the high end of our guidance range, and including foreign exchange, sales declined 1%. Walking through the r",895,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Operational sales growth of 4% came in at the high end of our guidance range, and including foreign exchange, sales declined 1%. Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 42.3% compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing and a lower negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $620 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 13%, reflecting our ongoing focus on controlling spending and rebasing our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta of approximately $25 million in the quarter. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $136 million declined 5% versus the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted R&D spend declined 2% as we continued to balance investment in key programs to support future growth while reducing infrastructure-related expenses. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.5% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by the positive gross margin and the operating savings I just referenced. Interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, Baxter retired approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt through the utilization of a portion of our retained Baxalta equity in 2 debt-for-equity exchanges. Following these exchanges, the company's gross debt now totals approximately $3.4 billion and our net debt totals approximately $1.15 billion. 
At the end of the quarter, Baxter held 30.5 million Baxalta shares, and we intend to utilize this remaining equity through a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan and an equity-for-equity exchange which was launched last week. We expect to complete utilization of all remaining Baxalta shares during the second quarter. 
Other income totaled $27 million and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $10 million and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake. The adjusted tax rate was 19.8% for the quarter. 
And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.28 to $0.30 per share. To decompose this favorability, it was driven by $0.04 of operational strength, $0.02 of benefit from other income and a lower foreign exchange headwind, which contributed approximately $0.01 relative to original expectations. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant-currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying growth of approximately 4%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 1%. 
We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of approximately 3% or approximately 5% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we now expect sales growth of high single digits for Fluid Systems, driven by the continued strength in the U.S. business. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we now expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide of $180 million remains unchanged and is based on the assumption that 2 additional competitors enter the market in 2016: the first, by midyear; and the second, during the latter part of 2016. After adjusting for cyclo, sales are expected to increase low single digits. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we now anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2% reflecting the softness we experienced in the first quarter. The growth trajectory for this category is expected to improve as we build upon new indications and geographic expansions. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect the other category to increase 6% to 7%. 
For the Renal business, we continue to expect full year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses and the stabilization in our in-center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 11.5%, a 50 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting favorable sales mix, disciplined management of expenses and a lower headwind from foreign exchange. We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $35 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This represents an increase from our original guidance and is driven by incremental strength we're observing within our U.S. business. For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 545 million shares. 
Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share as compared to our original guidance of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share. Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to now exceed $1.4 billion. We expect CapEx of approximately $900 million, which results in more than $500 million improved cash flow. 
Specific to the second quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency, to increase approximately 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.38 to $0.40 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

But we were very pleased with some of the 0-based activity that we did on the CapEx budget to reduce CapEx spending to start the year.

So I want to just reassure our investors that we have a significant amount of focus in this technology. Our base business, FLOSEAL, TISSEEL, COSEAL, those are great products and doing very well.

It's clear, we're very proud of the progress that we've made on spending, and I think the first quarter is clear evidence of that. But as we move to the latter part of the year, there's a couple things to be mindful of. First, the TSA income. We started recording this in the second half of last year. So that benefit on a year-over-year basis goes away in the second half of the year. And then the second comment is, with respect to restructuring and spending, we did have some benefit in the latter part of last year as we started to implement controls very quickly after the spinoff. And so some of those benefits, it's not appropriate to annualize that performance as we move forward. But it's safe to say, cost is a clear focus for us. I think the organization has taken this mandate, and really, we are going after this aggressively. We're pleased with the progress, and the first quarter is evidence of that."

So logical extension of that would be to go in an area that -- strengthening those for competencies. Now I can't speak from prior -- no, about prior management's strategic decisions. But when I look at this, I see there's a natural migration of our business. Now the competencies to manage a business like this are slightly different. And we're going to make sure that we have that in-house, and we're going to acquire that to be able to be even more successful. But this is the area of tremendous attractiveness for us, and I want to make sure that we are focused on that. But with all that said, the opportunistic nature of acquisitions will drive how we're going to approach this market."

And we do have some tougher comps, particularly in the fourth quarter, where in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a very strong performance in the Renal business. So that's one where I think there's some tougher comps, and we'll continue to watch this. But as we look at the long-range plan that we've shared, acceleration in the Renal business is a very important component of our long-term success.

But we also working diligently on a global platform that we're going to probably have more news in about 6 months down the road. But we have a significant effort. It's a great opportunity for us. And as we continue to gain market share in our infusion systems, you will see us coming up with new pump versions that will enable that feature. Enabling of the feature doesn't mean that the adoption is going to be there. It just makes sure that the hospital or the hospital system has the ability to connect with the EMR. Not everyone is ready, and -- but we will be ready as our customers become more diligent about using this feature. I just want to underscore the fact that our AMIA and CLARIA PD cyclers, both of them operate with a very sophisticated cloud-based system for communication between condition and patients.

And we -- as we have new technology coming about, Theranova, we'll -- hopefully, we'll be able to see that trend being steady. the -- so you have the natural momentum of that. The second part is access to the patient. In selective markets in the world, Baxter will make an attempt to connect direct with the patients. I have a great example in Canada where the government is really into the PD business. They think PD First is a good policy, not only for the patient but also for the system in terms of reimbursement and cost for the system, 60% penetration in Canada. So there are other opportunities in North America, and we're not happy not accessing the patient in North America. So we will have creative ways of connecting to the patient through payers, through providers to be able to increase the penetration of PD, therefore, increasing the future margins of this business. I have to say that when we look at the chronic renal -- the acute Renal business, that is a phenomenal business for the company, where we're going to probably launch a platform in critical care based on extra portfolio of therapies to accelerate even further the growth of that business -- give [ph]  Improved margins."

One is we have been investing in a number of R&D programs over the last year, so VIVIA, AMIA, along with PrisMAX, which are 3 major platform developments. That -- those run through the Renal segment's margins. So that's a factor that will go away over time. Related to that, we'll have the benefit of new product launches at a premium price, which will allow us to take margin up in that sense. And then the final point I would make, just tactically speaking, is you'll recall at our Investor Conference last year, we did comment that there was 150 basis points of incremental manufacturing cost that we'd experience in the short term as we look to address some regulatory opportunities for us. That impacted our numbers in the second half of last year and all of 2015 and a large component of that related to the Renal business. We do expect some of these costs to sunset over time. So in addition to the strategic component that Joe walked you through, I think there are a number of tactical elements that will also support margin in this business."

What provides innovation are people in the right places, developing products for unmet needs and also applications for a specific market.

There's approximately $0.06 of benefit from foreign exchange that we expect to see in the remaining part or over the course of the year. The second piece, though, and frankly, this is the one that I think we're happiest about, relates to operational performance. Our expectation now is that, operationally, we will be $0.06 better than our original expectations. And then there's a number of other puts and takes. Interest and other income related to equity gains and balance sheet gains is approximately $0.04, and that offsets tax rate and share count, which is a negative -- roughly negative $0.03 or $0.04.

The first one is a true strategy with disciplined capital allocation, so what program is really going to make -- through the company and give us big needle movers. The other thing is to impart the organization to develop what I call the singles and doubles and have more of a global entrepreneurial approach to the singles and doubles so we can benefit from all of them instead of funneling everything to a very complex and centralized capital allocation process. So we're doing that. We understand the categories of investment. We understand what buckets, and this is what we're going to talk to you guys next week. In terms of across opportunity, I just appointed a Chief Transformation Officer for the company. He's been with the company for a while, very well respected and understands the company deeply. He reports directly to me. And underneath this person, Robert Felicelli, we have all the cost transformation to simplify the company, to understand our back office and how to make more effective and more efficient areas of spending. We're going to -- no, we going to talk more in depth next week, 0-based budget, 0-based spending, 0-based organization. We're going very hard at this because I think there's an opportunity to free up some real good cash and turn this back to the investors but also, a bit of that, turn back into investment programs to make our company grow faster.

This is our first earnings announcement since our May Investor Conference, and the strategies we outlined at that time are clearly gaining traction. We are making steady progress in our efforts to enhance our financial performance through our disciplined focus on portfolio and innovation management, operational excellence and capital allocation. As you've seen in our press release, Baxter delivered strong topline and bottom-line results in the second quarter, exceeding expectations. 
I will share a few comments on our progress and then turn it over to Jay who will provide more details on the quarter and our updated financial outlook. After that, we will open the call for Q&A.
So let's get started. 
Baxter's worldwide sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% on a reported basis. Sales growth was driven by a strong performance in the U.S. systems, U.S. dialysis and global acute-care renal therapies. On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, reflected a benefit of better than expected sales growth, favorable product mix and the positive impact of our continuing business transformation efforts.
Now I'll briefly walk you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where we speak to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding foreign exchange, to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.
Global sales for hospital products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 7%. Excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide sales, hospital product sales increased 13% in the U.S. and 9% globally.
Now to break our hospital products at the franchise level. Sales in fluid systems were $586 million, up 15%. Growth continues to reflect the strong launch of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion system in the U.S. where we continued to gain market share, plus favorable demand in pricing in U.S. for IV solutions.
Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, increasing 4%. Growth, excluding cyclophosphamide, was up 8%, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by a solid performance across nutritional products, Pharma injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. With surgical care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery new products, sales totaled $347 million, up 5% year-over-year. We continued to view biosurgery as an attractive opportunity for growth through both innovation and geographic expansion. In the quarter, biosurgery sales increased mid-single digits globally. Sales continued to be impacted by lower sales of selected non-core biosurgery products, active fuse and daily strips, which depressed the growth in the quarter by approximately 2 percentage points. As we discussed at our May Investor Conference, we continued to focus on strengthening this portfolio through the introduction of new products and delivery devices, expanded indications and continued geographic expansion. During the quarter, we expanded the launch of, our advanced surgical to Brazil, Mexico and New Zealand. Provides services these markets in new ready to use option that has brought indications as an advanced surgical patch.
Our line of inhaled anesthetics continued to lead the market globally, with second quarter sales up 7%, globally driven by double-digit growth internationally where we continued to leverage our array of high quality well trusted anesthetics as a platform for continued geographic expansion.
During the quarter, revenues in the biopharma services partnering business totaled $124 million, a decline of 5% as expected. As previously mentioned, growth in the business has been impacted by customer electing to take manufacturing in-house.
Next, turning to our renal business. Global renal sales were $965 million, up 4%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. dialysis business where our highly innovative APD cycler featuring share sourced 2-way[ph] online connectivity, continues to build momentum in the marketplace. There are already more than 500 patients of AMIA in the U.S. today which have provided a well over 30,000 treatments taking advantage of our cloud-based platform for remote patient therapy management.
In addition, during the second quarter, AMIA with shares source was also approved in Canada, representing a new frontier for growth. Renal growth in the quarter also benefited from a strong growth in acute business, driven by increased market adoption for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRTT RRT as a treatment for acute kidney injuries. Performance in the quarter also benefited from a strong flu season and competitive supply issues. We are very excited about the opportunities for this business, which remains one of our fastest-growing areas and an active area of focus moving forward. Our leading flex platform was recently approved in China. And we've initiated launch of our press lung local carbon dioxide removable device in France, Germany and Sweden.
Growth in the business declined in the core as we continued to take a targeted approach to how we manage this business, including being selective of market and standards we need to participate and to support our objective of improving profitability in this business. 
Before concluding, I would share a quick leadership update. Over the past few weeks, there were outstanding executives have joined Baxter leadership team. This include Joseph, the new appointed President of our Renal business, our new Vice President of Corporate Communications, Scott Trachtman, our new Vice President of operations; and finally, our Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. And Andy will lead Baxter's efforts to accelerate activities in the area of strategy and business development to augment our growth aspirations. The entire team, those you met in May and our most recent additions share my passion For Baxter's mission and a sense of urgency to drive transformation to pursue a top quartile performance. I have the utmost confidence in them as and as highly unified team to deliver of the potential that lies ahead for the company and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we will have time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our second quarter results. It's another important building block as we look to achieve our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 6% in the quarter, and on a reported basis, sales grew 4%. Growth came in 2 points above our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in fluid systems, acute renal and anesthesia. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. 
Adjusted gross margin of 43.8% also compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix and improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $663 million and decreased 11% on a reported basis. This represents a 440 basis point year-over-year improvement. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the rebasing of our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta shire. 
TSA income totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these services ramps down. We expect TSA income in the second half of 2016 to be approximately $50 million compared to $65 million in the second half of 2015.
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $150 million increased to 1% versus the prior year. As we have previously announced, we discontinued our investment in the home hemodialysis program in the second quarter. We plan to reinvest that spending into new programs in PD, biosurgery and other initiatives to fuel future growth.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.3% and compares favorably to our expectations, driven by increased sales, positive product mix and continued discipline around expense management. This represents a 530 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015.
Interest expense was $11 million in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of lower debt balances resulting from the utilization of the Baxalta retained stake to retire approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt. Interest expense in the quarter was also impacted by a one-time reclassification of capitalized interest from other interests.
During the second quarter, Baxter completed its disposition of the retained Baxalta equity through a contribution to its U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $700 million and an equity for equity exchange which reduced Baxter's outstanding share count by approximately 11 million. 
Adjusted other income totaled $13[ph] million in the quarter and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $3 million and dividend income of approximately $7 million associated with our former Baxalta equity stake. 
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.06 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to slightly slower than expected cyclophosphamide sales in the quarter.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. 
Starting with sales. On a constant-currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year's sales for Baxter to increase between 3% and 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase 1% to 2%. We expect growth in the hospital products business of 3% to 4% or 5% to 6% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide.
Within the hospital products franchise, we now expect sales growth of low double digits for fluid systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide and now expect full year sales of $190 million, with the assumptions that additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%. 
And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect PPS and other to decline low single digits, reflecting a change in our manufacturing service agreement with Shire. Selective products we have previously been manufacturing on their behalf will now be transitioned to self manufacture by shire. 
For the renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 3% to 4%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our incensed HD business.
Moving down the P&L. 
We now expect an operating margin of approximately 12%, 100 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting increased sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5% to 21%. We expect the tax rate in second half of the year to increase as the first half benefited from certain discrete items.
For the full year, we anticipate an average share count in the range of 545 to 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2015 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share.
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million, resulting in more than $500 million in free cash flow.
Specific to the third quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to increase 3% to 4%.

We don't comment specifically on targets as we want to make sure that that we'll get there first and don't get to pay too much for them, but we are very disciplined in that area. We've been looking at significant amount of opportunities. I just reviewed yesterday, we have probably more than 15 different opportunities in our pipeline. But I have to say that we also walk away from 4 deals in the last 90 days. They were too expensive. And we've got to make sure that we have the discipline to execute. We could execute those deals internally. We had absolutely the right teams to get them done. But the price was too high and somebody else is willing to pay more money for that asset. If we don't see a way there, we're not going to be competitive on prices up deals. I tell you, our focus is to execute, and we have -- and Andy as part of my operating team. Also, raise the profile of the M&A in our company, and we're working hard to provide those as we continued to progress in creating operational opportunities for the company, as well as organic opportunities. Our balance sheet is pristine at this moment in time. And so one thing about M&A doesn't preclude us of buying shares back. If shares back, doesn't preclude us from doing M&A. I think we need to have a balanced approach and we can probably both of them if we do it correctly."

Generally, you're right, it was a great quarter from a sales perspective. You look at businesses like the U.S. fluid systems, as you pointed out, and we saw a north of 30% growth in the U.S. Just thinking about that business for a second, there is really 2 primary components to it. One is the infusion systems business, and that's really driven by sales on the Spectrum pump, along with sales of the attendant set. So once you install a pump, you have this set that ride along with that. Our sets growth in the quarter was north of 20%, and then the infusion systems overall growth was north of 30%. And then on the other side, we have the IV therapy business in this particular area and that also grew north of 30%. In the case of IV therapy, it was a balanced mix of price and volume that drove the growth. The other area where we saw some pricing in the portfolio is in the area of U.S. PD where we did see some opportunities to capture value. But beyond that, it's a fairly stable pricing environment. I wouldn't say that there are massive or very significant changes to price beyond those 2 areas that I've referenced."

I think from the first half to the second half, there are a number of drivers of change. One is we do have a cyclo impact. In particular in the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see around $40 million of year-over-year decline related to cyclo on the sales line. As it relates to other areas in terms of the sales growth, we are taking a very disciplined approach across the portfolio. So as we look at areas where that downturn the right economic return for us, we will very much walk away from particular tenders or businesses. And so in the fourth quarter of this year, there is probably another $30 million to $40 million of low margin sales that we choose to forgo. And then final, the other comment I would make, on the third quarter relates to last year, we did have order in the third quarter of last year that makes a tough comparable, that was about $20 million. So if you adjust for those items, I think the sales sort of makes -- is more explainable. Overall, as we think about the guidance on EPS in the second half, if you will go back the last quarter's earnings call, the implied second half guidance was $0.85 to $0.91 in earnings per share in the second half. As we think about today, our current view is $0.87 to $0.92. So essentially, we've raised the midpoint of the second half guidance by about $0.015. And which you have to realize that there a couple of drags on the second half number. The tax rate is slightly higher than our expectations, in part because of profitability coming in higher tax jurisdictions, so that's about 1 point And the share count is a little bit higher, I should say, $0.01. And then the share count is a little bit higher as well in the second half of the year, so that's about $0.01. We do see a benefit of cyclo of about $0.01, but the ongoing organic base performance that we anticipate improving in the second half is about $0.03 relative to the last time we shared guidance. So overall, I think it's a story of continued momentum, but there are some factors that slow second half relative to first half."

I mean from an overall gross margin standpoint, clearly, we were pleased with the result in the quarter. And as we think about what drove margin in the second quarter and what drives it to the balance of the year, gross margin that is, there is the price, net price positive impact that we've seen in the quarter. So that's one element. Now importantly, we've signed many of our agreements. We've concluded many of the agreements in a variety of our businesses. So as we move to next year, we don't expect to see the same level of price or economic value capture that we have experienced, but there are still some opportunities for pricing. The other element in the second quarter of that was, from my standpoint, very exciting was the area of mix. And so I commented earlier on 20% growth in sets. Sets carry a higher margin than the corporate average. We talked about the acute business which was just a star performer in the quarter. That too carries a higher margin in the corporate average. We also saw a good growth coming out of anesthesia and nutrition. This idea of accelerating the growth of our higher margin products, that's something that we expect to continue for the balance of this long-range planning period. And that will be one of the contributors that takes us to our aspiration of the 17% to 18% operating margin by 2020. The last comment I would make is, generally speaking, we saw a very solid volumes in the first and second quarters, and its accelerated sales growth does have a positive absorption impact on the entire manufacturing and distribution network which allows us to benefit from higher margins by absorbing more costs. So it really was a confluence of events. We do expect to see continued margin improvements moving forward."

What I would say as we look for the full year cash flow forecast is the probability of achieving our forecast has increased based on the 2 quarters that we have under our belts. I'm very pleased with the performance. At the Investor Day, we talked about a number of important initiatives that we are embarking on. We just started a days payable project. And one of the comments I made at the Investor Day is the ratio between days payable and days receivable, day sales outstanding, doesn't quite work for us. It's a real opportunity. And I will tell you the early signs of some of these projects are going very well. But the reason that we haven't changed guidance on cash flow is a lot of our cash flow is back end loaded due to normal seasonality patterns. And until I get a little bit better line of sight to help Q3 emerges and expectations on Q4, it is a bit premature to raise the cash flow guidance, but I will tell you that the probability of achievement has increased. The other thing I will say is, we have been really focus on CapEx and -- so this is an area where we believe that there is opportunity for us. The 9% of sales is something that we are striving very aggressively to improve. We have long-term plans to do so, but that's another area that as we move towards the end of the year, that may be another area that we update. So on balance, I feel quite good about how the cash flow story is shaping up for our company. And frankly, from a free cash flow standpoint, this is a real opportunity for us not, only this year but moving forward."

Outside the U.S., we reported 3% growth internationally. And what I would say is, emerging markets, roughly mid-single digits growth. We did have lower growth in China in the quarter, so low-single digits, in large part, u will recall, we exited certain tenders for PD where the margins weren't attractive to us, so there was that overhang on our overall business in emerging markets and in China.

So as we think about the sustainability of this particular aspect, there should be a steady grower for the next several years, in part because of the contracts that we discussed, but also in part because of continued volume that we look to bring to the U.S. In the other rough[ph]we have of the business, the infusion systems area, there is 2 component pieces to this. The larger one today relates to pump sales, so we've had great success with pump business and we continued to perform in line with the expectations or better than with the expectations that we've shared with investors over the last year on pump placements. But then the other benefit is as we place pumps, going with those pumps is a noncapital sale, and that's the set piece, right? So our sets were up, as I said earlier, north of 20% in the quarter, just a very solid element. This becomes more of an annuity or an ongoing stream of business that's related to pumps. And so I would say that's a more sustainable business than the capital sales which are a little bit lumpier in nature, if you will. Overall though, we feel confident that the business will grow, I believe, north of 10% on a full year basis globally. And then moving forward for the next 5 years, this 3 to 4 kind of mid-single digit type growth is what we can expect to see from fluid systems."

And there were a variety of reasons, but it was not meaningful. But when you talk about missing cyclo sales relative to expectations by $5 million, $7 million, that has an impact on both gross margin and EPS. So the margin that we saw was, even in excess from a pure operational standpoint, but look, there are 2 primary factors, right? One is price, so we did see some price benefit in the quarter. But another -- and again, this is the more sort of exciting area as I look at the business, it's the area of mix. So when you have our sets business or acute business, which is $400 million business, our anesthesia business which is, I believe, north of $700 million, our nutrition business, which is also a very healthy sized business for us, when you have roughly 20-ish -- 20% of your portfolio rolling at a faster rate than the corporate average, and when that has a much higher average margin than the corporate average, it really is a benefit that you see on the gross margin line. In our case, that's something that we experienced in the second quarter. Now turning to the rest of the year, we do expect to see some of that continued benefit from the accelerated growth of those higher-margin businesses. But then there is also a secondary impact, which I referenced earlier, which is as you plant fill up with incremental volume, there is additional absorption that's occurred, the manufacturing network becomes more utilized, so you do see an attendant absorption benefit on the cost profile which also impacts margin. So second quarter, great. You see price and mix playing coming to a bare. Moving forward, we'll have price mix and volume, and that's why we've been able to increase the guidance in the second half of the year."

Overall, from a volume standpoint, we don't expect an impact from some of the macro challenges we are seeing in Europe. Most of our product lines are more steady stream from a unit standpoint, so we don't really anticipate an impact in that sense. From a foreign exchange standpoint, really, we have a number of hedges and opportunities that we have. So as it relates to the U.K., we have roughly 5% of our sales in the U.K. We do have a manufacturing plant in the U.K. that provides natural hedge against fluctuations in that currency. And then in the Eurozone area, we have a number of plants. So as the euro moves, we do have natural offsets to sales, the currency fluctuations in that market as well. But the other thing that we do is, we use synthetic hedges or derivatives, principally options, to hedge foreign currency exposure. And we have a well disciplined approach where we hedge out up to 5 or 6 quarters. We hedge roughly 20% per quarter. And we use options which really caps the downside associated with those instruments. Now for us, as we evaluated the Brexit situation leading up to that particular event, we actually did a couple of things. We increased our exposure or increased our derivative positions on the pound and increased our derivative positions on the euro as well as an insurance policy to ensure that there will be no adverse impact this year or next year. And so the result of that is, despite the movement in the pound and the euro, we really offset some of the translational impact of the P&L with gains associated with those derivatives that we put in place, and we're very pleased with the situation that we're currently in. The other item that we did is, as the yen strengthened, we did take the opportunity to increase some of our exposure, again, using options so that the downside is limited to the yen. So we hedged some of our incremental yen positions at basically 100 to $1. Again, a trade that we were pleased with and situated as well for both this year and next year from a foreign exchange risk standpoint."

But as we have seen growing and coming up in product development, this for us now the focus outside the U.S. with a global product line, and I think we have that strategy and the products line-up to do so, so we'll be coming out soon with new products that will create momentum outside U.S. and protect our base."

This is our first earnings announcement since our May Investor Conference, and the strategies we outlined at that time are clearly gaining traction. We are making steady progress in our efforts to enhance our financial performance through our disciplined focus on portfolio and innovation management, operational excellence and capital allocation. As you've seen in our press release, Baxter delivered strong topline and bottom-line results in the second quarter, exceeding expectations. 
I will share a few comments on our progress and then turn it over to Jay who will provide more details on the quarter and our updated financial outlook. After that, we will open the call for Q&A.
So let's get started. 
Baxter's worldwide sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% on a reported basis. Sales growth was driven by a strong performance in the U.S. Fluid Systems, U.S. Peritoneal Dialysis and global acute care renal therapies. On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, reflected a benefit of better than expected sales growth, favorable product mix and the positive impact of our continuing business transformation efforts.
Now I'll briefly walk you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where we speak to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding foreign exchange, to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.
Global sales for hospital products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 7%. Excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide sales, hospital product sales increased 13% in the U.S. and 9% globally.
Now to break our hospital products at the franchise level. Sales in fluid systems were $586 million, up 15%. Growth continues to reflect the strong launch of the SIGMA Spectrum infusion system in the U.S., where we continued to gain market share, plus favorable demand in pricing in U.S. for IV solutions.
Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, increasing 4%. Growth, excluding cyclophosphamide, was up 8%, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by a solid performance across nutritional products, Pharma injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. With surgical care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, sales totaled $347 million, up 5% year-over-year. We continued to view biosurgery as an attractive opportunity for growth through both innovation and geographic expansion. In the quarter, biosurgery sales increased mid-single digits globally. Sales continued to be impacted by lower sales of selected non-core biosurgery products, active fuse and daily strips, which depressed the growth in the quarter by approximately 2 percentage points. As we discussed at our May Investor Conference, we continued to focus on strengthening this portfolio through the introduction of new products and delivery devices, expanded indications and continued geographic expansion. During the quarter, we expanded the launch of HEMOPATCH, our advanced surgical patch to Brazil, Mexico and New Zealand. HEMOPATCH provides surgeries in these markets in new ready-to-use option that has broad indications as an advanced surgical patch.
Our line of inhaled anesthetics continued to lead the market globally, with second quarter sales up 7%, globally driven by double-digit growth internationally where we continued to leverage our array of high-quality well-trusted anesthetics as a platform for continued geographic expansion.
During the quarter, revenues in the biopharma services partnering business totaled $124 million, a decline of 5% as expected. As previously mentioned, growth in the business has been impacted by customer electing to take manufacturing in-house.
Next, turning to our renal business. Global renal sales were $965 million, up 4%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, where our highly innovative AMIA APD cycler featuring SHARESOURCE 2-way online connectivity continues to build momentum in the marketplace. There are already more than 500 patients on AMIA in the U.S. today, which have provided a well over 30,000 treatments taking advantage of our cloud-based platform for remote patient therapy management.
In addition, during the second quarter, AMIA with SHARESOURCE was also approved in Canada, representing a new frontier for growth. Renal growth in the quarter also benefited from a strong growth in acute business, driven by increased market adoption for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT as a treatment for acute kidney injuries. Performance in the quarter also benefited from a strong flu season and competitive supply issues. We're very excited about the opportunities for this business, which remains one of our fastest-growing areas and an active area of focus moving forward. Our leading Prismaflex platform was recently approved in China. And we've initiated launch of our PrismaLung low-flow carbon dioxide removal device in France, Germany and Sweden.
Growth in the in-center HD business declined in the core as we continued to take a targeted approach to how we manage this business, including being selective of our one market and tenders we need to participate and to support our objective of improving profitability in this business. 
Before concluding, I would share a quick leadership update. Over the past few weeks, there were outstanding executives have joined Baxter's senior leadership team. These include Giuseppe Accogli, the new appointed President of our Renal business; [indiscernible] our new Vice President of Corporate Communications; Scott [indiscernible], Vice President of operations; and finally, Andy Kidd, our Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. And Andy will lead Baxter's effort to accelerate activities in the area of strategy and business development to augment our growth aspirations. The entire team, those you met in May and our most recent additions share my passion for Baxter's mission and a sense of urgency to drive transformation to pursue a top quartile performance. I have the utmost confidence in them as [indiscernible] and as a highly unified team to deliver on the potential that lies ahead for the company and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we will have time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results. It's another important building block as we look to achieve our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 6% in the quarter, and on a reported basis, sales grew 4%. Growth came in 2 points above our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in fluid systems, acute renal and anesthesia. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. 
Adjusted gross margin of 43.8% also compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix and improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $663 million and decreased 11% on a reported basis. This represents a 440 basis points year-over-year improvement. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the rebasing of our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta-Shire. 
TSA income totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these services ramps down. We expect TSA income in the second half of 2016 to be approximately $50 million compared to $65 million in the second half of 2015.
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $150 million increased to 1% versus the prior year. As we had previously announced, we discontinued our investment in the VIVIA home hemodialysis program in the second quarter. We plan to reinvest that spending into new programs in PD, biosurgery and other initiatives to fuel future growth.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.3% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by increased sales, positive product mix and continued discipline around expense management. This represents a 530 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2015.
Interest expense was $11 million in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of lower debt balances resulting from the utilization of the Baxalta retained stake to retire approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt. Interest expense in the quarter was also impacted by a one-time reclassification of capitalized interest from other to interests.
During the second quarter, Baxter completed its disposition of the retained Baxalta equity through a contribution to its U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $700 million and an equity for equity exchange, which reduced Baxter's outstanding share count by approximately 11 million. 
Adjusted other income totaled $30 million in the quarter and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $3 million and dividend income of approximately $7 million associated with our former Baxalta equity stake. 
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.06 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to slightly slower than expected cyclophosphamide sales in the quarter.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. 
Starting with sales. On a constant-currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year's sales for Baxter to increase between 3% and 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase 1% to 2%. We expect growth in the hospital products business of 3% to 4% or 5% to 6% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide.
Within the hospital products franchise, we now expect sales growth of low double digits for fluid systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide and now expect full year sales of $190 million, with the assumptions that additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%. 
And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect PPS and other to decline low single digits, reflecting a change in our manufacturing service agreement with Shire. Selective products we had previously been manufacturing on their behalf will now be transitioned to self manufacture by Shire. 
For the renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 3% to 4%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business.
Moving down to P&L. 
We now expect an operating margin of approximately 12%, 100 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting increased sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5% to 21%. We expect the tax rate in second half of the year to increase as the first half benefited from certain discrete items.
For the full year, we anticipate an average share count in the range of 545 to 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2015 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share.
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million, resulting in more than $500 million in free cash flow.
Specific to the third quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve 2% to 3%. And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.43 to $0.45 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

We've been looking at significant amount of opportunities. I just reviewed yesterday, we have probably more than 15 different opportunities in our pipeline. But I have to say that we also walked away from 4 deals in the last 90 days. They were too expensive. And we've got to make sure that we have the discipline to execute. We could execute those deals internally. We had absolutely the right teams to get them done. But the price was too high and somebody else is willing to pay more money for that asset. If we don't see a way there, we're not going to be competitive on prices up deals. I tell you, our focus is to execute, and we have -- having Andy Kidd as part of my operating team. Also, raise the profile of the M&A jobs in our company, and we're working very hard to find those as we continued to progress in creating operational opportunities for the company, as well as organic opportunities. Our balance sheet is pristine at this moment in time. And so one thing about M&A doesn't preclude us of buying shares back. If shares back, doesn't preclude us from doing M&A.

One is the infusion systems business, and that's really driven by sales of the Spectrum pump, along with sales of the attendant sets. So once you install a pump and you have this sets that ride along with that. Our sets growth in the quarter was north of 20%, and then the infusion systems overall growth was north of 30%. And then on the other side, we have the IV therapy business in this particular area and that also grew north of 30%. In the case of IV therapy, it was a balanced mix of price and volume that drove the growth. The other area where we saw some pricing in the portfolio is in the area of U.S. PD where we did see some opportunities to capture value. But beyond that, it's a fairly stable pricing environment.

The only thing I would add is, we do see some pockets of price pressure in the portfolio. And so, in some instances, there are offsets to price increases that we see. In certain markets, for example, where we see dialyzer pricing or other particular product areas, there are certain areas where we do see price pressure. So it is a balance, and it's hard to answer the question across the board."

I mean, I think, from the first half to the second half, there are a number of drivers of change. One is, we do have a cyclo impact. In particular in the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see around $40 million of year-over-year decline related to cyclo on the sales line. As it relates to other areas in terms of sales growth, we are taking a very disciplined approach across the portfolio. So as we look at areas where that downturn the right economic return for us, we will very much walk away from particular tenders or businesses. And so in the fourth quarter of this year, there is probably another $30 million to $40 million of low margin sales that we choose to forgo. And then final, the other comments I would make on the third quarter relates to Protopam last year. We did have a Protopam order in the third quarter of last year that makes a tough comparable, that was about $20 million. So if you adjust for those items, I think the sales sort of makes -- is more explainable. Overall, as we think about the guidance on EPS in the second half, if you were to go back to last quarter's earnings call, the implied second half guidance was $0.85 to $0.91 in earnings per share in the second half. As we think about today, our current view is $0.87 to $0.92. So essentially, we've raised the midpoint of the second half guidance by about $0.015. And which you have to realize that there are a couple of drags on the second half number. The tax rate is slightly higher than our expectations, in part because of profitability coming in higher tax jurisdictions, so that's about 1 point And the share count is a little bit higher, I should say, $0.01. And then the share count is a little bit higher as well in the second half of the year, so that's about $0.01. We do see a benefit of cyclo of about $0.01, but the ongoing organic base performance that we anticipate improving in the second half is about $0.03 relative to the last time we shared guidance. So overall, I think it's a story of continued momentum, but there are some factors that will slow second half relative to first half."

I mean from an overall gross margin standpoint, clearly, we were pleased with the result in the quarter. And as we think about what drove margin in the second quarter and what drives it to the balance of the year, gross margin that is, there is the price, net price positive impact that we've seen in the quarter. So that's one element. Now importantly, we've signed many of our agreements. We've concluded many of the agreements in a variety of our businesses. So as we move to next year, we don't expect to see the same level of price or economic value capture that we have experienced, but there are still some opportunities for pricing. The other element in the second quarter that was, from my standpoint, very exciting was the area of mix. And so I commented earlier on 20% growth in sets. Sets carry a higher margin than the corporate average. We talked about the acute business, which was just a star performer in the quarter. That too carries a higher margin in the corporate average. We also saw a good growth coming out of anesthesia and nutrition. This idea of accelerating the growth of our higher margin products, that's something that we expect to continue for the balance of this long-range planning period. And that will be one of the contributors that takes us to our aspiration of the 17% to 18% operating margin by 2020. The last comment I would make is, generally speaking, we saw very solid volumes in the first and second quarters, and it's accelerated sales growth does have a positive absorption impact on the entire manufacturing and distribution network, which allows us to benefit from higher margins by absorbing more costs. So it really was a confluence of events. We do expect to see continued margin improvements moving forward."

I'm very pleased with the performance. At the Investor Day, we talked about a number of important initiatives that we are embarking on. We just started a days payable project. And one of the comments I made at the Investor Day is the ratio between days payable and days receivable, day sales outstanding, doesn't quite work for us, it's a real opportunity. And I will tell you the early signs of that some of these projects are going very well. But the reason that we haven't changed guidance on cash flow is a lot of our cash flow is back-end loaded due to normal seasonality patterns. And until I get a little bit better line of sight to how Q3 emerges and expectations on Q4, it is a bit premature to raise the cash flow guidance, but I will tell you that the probability of achievement has increased. The other thing I will say is, we have been really focus on CapEx and -- so this is an area where we believe that there is opportunity for us. The 9% of sales is something that we are striving very aggressively to improve. We have long-term plans to do so, but that's another area that as we move towards the end of the year, that may be another area that we update. So on balance, I feel quite good about how the cash flow story is shaping up for our company.

So there were a number of factors that sets the conditions up for success in the U.S. that allowed us to overachieve our expectations and deliver the 10% growth. Outside the U.S., we reported 3% growth internationally. And what I would say is, emerging markets, roughly mid-single digits growth. We did have lower growth in China in the quarter, so low-single digits, in large part, u will recall, we exited certain tenders for PD where the margins weren't attractive to us, so there was that overhang on our overall business in emerging markets and in China. We do expect to sunset that after this quarter, so we'll see an acceleration, we expect to see in emerging markets in the Q3, Q4 timeframe.

I mean, look, overall, fluid systems business, we anticipate over the next 5 years to be a 3% to 4% grower, although I look at this particular quarter, it's a very solid data point in terms of growth and adoption that we were pleased with. Thinking about the performance of the business, it's important to decompose it into a couple of different segments, right? One is the ID business, and we are working very hard to bring additional volumes to the market. We're very focused on delivering. So as we think about the sustainability of this particular aspect, this should be a steady grower for the next several years, in part because of the contracts that we discussed, but also in part because of continued volume that we look to bring to the U.S. In the other rough we have of the business, the infusion systems area, there's 2 component pieces to this. The larger one today relates to pump sales, so we've had great success with pump business and we continued to perform in line with the expectations or better than with the expectations that we've shared with investors over the last year on pump placements. But then the other benefit is as we place pumps, going with those pumps is a noncapital sale, and that's the set piece, right? So our sets were up, as I said earlier, north of 20% in the quarter, just a very solid element. This becomes more of an annuity or an ongoing stream of business that's related to pumps. And so I would say that's a more sustainable business than the capital sales which are a little bit lumpier in nature, if you will. Overall though, we feel confident that the business will grow, I believe, north of 10% on a full year basis globally. And then moving forward for the next 5 years, this 3 to 4 kind of mid-single digit type growth is what we can expect to see from fluid systems."

And there were a variety of reasons, but it was not meaningful. But when you talk about missing cyclo sales relative to expectations by $5 million, $7 million, that has an impact on both gross margin and EPS. So the margin that we saw was, even in excess from a pure operational standpoint, but look, there are 2 primary factors, right? One is price, so we did see some price benefit in the quarter. But another -- and again, this is the more sort of exciting area as I look at the business, it's an area of mix. So when you have our sets business or acute business, which is $400 million business, our anesthesia business which is, I believe, north of $700 million, our nutrition business, which is also a very healthy size business for us, when you have roughly 20-ish -- 20% of your portfolio rolling at a faster rate than the corporate average, and when that has a much higher average margin than the corporate average, it really is a benefit that you see on the gross margin line. In our case, that's something that we experienced in the second quarter. Now turning to the rest of the year, we do expect to see some of that continued benefit from the accelerated growth of those higher-margin businesses. But then there is also a secondary impact, which I referenced earlier, which is as your plants fill up with incremental volume, there is additional absorption that's occurred, the manufacturing network becomes more utilized, so you do see an attendant absorption benefit on the cost profile, which also impacts margin.

We have somebody in charge of that who reports directly to Paul Vibert, our President of International. A couple of notable areas, we just launched a big pump in Italy and Europe, that was a local initiative. The elastomeric business is active outside the U.S. and we have the right products on parts of Europe, which was launched, that's a good pickup in margin and sales for the group. We also have a plan to bring China to $1 billion by 2021, which is now much shorter than they're in LRT. So that brings growth up to close to 10%. So we're very excited about that. It was also done local China for China, a significant amount of change in direction and mix of products with the parts of the business refocusing nutrition was China, which is a great opportunity, and introducing biosurgery in China, which we don't have today. So these are just 2 examples. I can give you a great example in Brazil and Columbia where we launched in our ringer product and with big sales in 3 years of $15 million, it's highly profitable. So we have significant amount of programs going on in the company to sustain organic growth, driven by more discipline in cadence of launching products and have products available for the rest of the world. We didn't do particularly a good driving launching in products on a global basis and we reinvigorated that. And we have so many good products and good invention and innovation in-house. So those are really exciting and creating momentum in the company."

So we have those capabilities in-house. We'll look at some of these deals, and we don't see the price, the coherence between pricing them. And I think when we don't see the coherence and does not meet our expectations, we have very established guidelines with our board. They reflect our best interest of our shareholders. I would say we will not step into those deals. We walked away from another deal. They had a significant difference between us and a foreign party was strengthened by the company.

Overall, from a volume standpoint, we don't expect an impact from some of the macro challenges we're seeing in Europe. Most of our product lines are more steady stream from a unit standpoint, so we don't really anticipate an impact in that sense. From a foreign exchange standpoint, really, we have a number of hedges and opportunities that we have. So as it relates to the U.K., we have roughly 5% of our sales in the U.K. We do have a manufacturing plant in the U.K. that provides natural hedge against fluctuations in that currency. And then in the Eurozone area, we have a number of plants. So as the euro moves, we do have natural offsets to sales, the currency fluctuations in that market as well. But the other thing that we do is, we use synthetic hedges or derivatives, principally options, to hedge foreign currency exposure. And we have a well disciplined approach where we hedge out up to 5 or 6 quarters. We hedge roughly 20% per quarter. And we use options which really caps the downside associated with those instruments. Now for us, as we evaluated the Brexit situation leading up to that particular event, we actually did a couple of things. We increased our exposure or increased our derivative positions on the pound and increased our derivative positions on the euro as well as an insurance policy to ensure that there will be no adverse impact this year or next year. And so the result of that is, despite the movement in the pound and the euro, we really offset some of the translational impact of the P&L with gains associated with those derivatives that we put in place, and we're very pleased with the situation that we're currently in. The other item that we did is, as the yen strengthened, we did take the opportunity to increase some of our exposure, again, using options so that the downside is limited to the yen. So we hedged some of our incremental yen positions at basically JPN 100 to $1. Again, a trade that we were pleased with and situated as well for both this year and next year from a foreign exchange risk standpoint."

We're able to supply products for our patients.

We've just launched several different programs in biosurgery. And lastly, our point of care is now being fully funded as we are planning to come into the U.S. in about 3 years with our new point of care to provide patients with on-demand manufacture of peritoneal dialysis solution in the home. So we'll use up their money. That's one of the reasons that didn't flow, will not flow to the bottom line. We just have better uses for their money. Very consistent with our capital allocation policy, as well as we see great opportunity across the board, in many organic opportunities. And one last to mention is IPS, actually, we accelerated all the molecules that were slated for '19, '20, '21 to come earlier and that program costs money and we're funding that as well with some of the [ph] TTM money. So a great organic opportunity in the company, could not pass the opportunity of putting money in the right places."

This is our first earnings announcement since our May Investor Conference, and the strategies we outlined at that time are clearly gaining traction. We are making steady progress in our efforts to enhance our financial performance through our disciplined focus on portfolio and innovation management, operational excellence and capital allocation. As you've seen in our press release, Baxter delivered strong topline and bottom-line results in the second quarter, exceeding expectations. 
I will share a few comments on our progress and then turn it over to Jay who will provide more details on the quarter and our updated financial outlook. After that, we will open the call for Q&A.
So let's get started. 
Baxter's worldwide sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% on a reported basis. Sales growth was driven by a strong performance in the U.S. Fluid Systems, U.S. Peritoneal Dialysis and global acute care renal therapies. On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, reflecting a benefit of better than expected sales growth, favorable product mix and the positive impact of our continuing business transformation efforts.
Now I'll briefly walk you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where we speak to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding foreign exchange, to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.
Global sales for hospital products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 7%. Excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide sales, hospital product sales increased 13% in the U.S. and 9% globally.
Now to break out hospital products at the franchise level. Sales in fluid systems were $586 million, up 15%. Growth continues to reflect the strong launch of the SIGMA Spectrum infusion system in the U.S., where we continued to gain market share, plus favorable demand in pricing in U.S. for IV solutions.
Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, increasing 4%. Growth, excluding cyclophosphamide, was up 8%, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by solid performance across nutritional products, Pharma injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. With surgical care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, sales totaled $347 million, up 5% year-over-year. We continued to view biosurgery as an attractive opportunity for growth through both innovation and geographic expansion. In the quarter, biosurgery sales increased mid-single digits globally. Sales continued to be impacted by lower sales of selected non-core biosurgery products, Actifuse and Peri-Strips, which depressed the growth in the quarter by approximately 2 percentage points. As we discussed at our May Investor Conference, we continued to focus on strengthening this portfolio through the introduction of new products and delivery devices, expanded indications and continued geographic expansion. 
During the quarter, we expanded the launch of HEMOPATCH, our advanced surgical patch to Brazil, Mexico and New Zealand. HEMOPATCH provides surgeons in these markets in new ready-to-use option that has broad indications as an advanced surgical patch.
Our line of inhaled anesthetics continued to lead the market globally, with second quarter sales up 7%, globally driven by double-digit growth internationally where we continued to leverage our array of high-quality well-trusted anesthetics as a platform for continued geographic expansion.
During the quarter, revenues in the biopharma services partnering business totaled $124 million, a decline of 5% as expected. As previously mentioned, growth in the business has been impacted by a customer electing to take manufacturing in-house.
Next, turning to our renal business. Global renal sales were $965 million, up 4%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, where our highly innovative AMIA APD cycler featuring SHARESOURCE 2-way online connectivity continues to build momentum in the marketplace. There are already more than 500 patients on AMIA in the U.S. today, which have provided a well over 30,000 treatments taking advantage of our cloud-based platform for remote patient therapy management.
In addition, during the second quarter, AMIA with SHARESOURCE was also approved in Canada, representing a new frontier for growth. Renal growth in the quarter also benefited from a strong growth in acute business, driven by increased market adoption for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT as a treatment for acute kidney injuries. Performance in the quarter also benefited from a strong flu season and competitive supply issues. We're very excited about the opportunities for this business, which remains one of our fastest-growing areas and an active area of focus moving forward. Our leading Prismaflex platform was recently approved in China. And we've initiated launch of our PrismaLung low-flow carbon dioxide removal device in France, Germany and Sweden.
Growth in the in-center HD business declined in the core as we continued to take a targeted approach to how we manage this business, including being selective about what market and tenders we need to participate and to support our objective of improving profitability in this business. 
Before concluding, I would share a quick leadership update. Over the past few weeks, several outstanding executives have joined Baxter's senior leadership team. These include Giuseppe Accogli, the new appointed President of our Renal business; Stacey Eisen [ph], our new Vice President of Corporate Communications; Scott Pleau, our new Vice President of Operations; and finally, Andy Kidd, our Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. And Andy will lead Baxter's effort to accelerate activities in the area of strategy and business development to augment our growth aspirations. The entire team, those you met in May and our most recent additions share my passion for Baxter's mission and a sense of urgency to drive transformation to pursue a top quartile performance. I have the utmost confidence in them as individuals and as a highly unified team to deliver on the potential that lies ahead for the company and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we will have time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results. It's another important building block as we look to achieve our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 6% in the quarter, and on a reported basis, sales grew 4%. Growth came in 2 points above our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in fluid systems, acute renal and anesthesia. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. 
Adjusted gross margin of 43.8% also compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix and improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $663 million and decreased 11% on a reported basis. This represents a 440 basis points year-over-year improvement. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the rebasing of our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta-Shire. 
TSA income totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these services ramps down. We expect TSA income in the second half of 2016 to be approximately $50 million compared to $65 million in the second half of 2015.
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $150 million increased to 1% versus the prior year. As we had previously announced, we discontinued our investment in the VIVIA home hemodialysis program in the second quarter. We plan to reinvest that spending into new programs in PD, biosurgery and other initiatives to fuel future growth.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.3% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by increased sales, positive product mix and continued discipline around expense management. This represents a 530 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2015.
Interest expense was $11 million in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of lower debt balances resulting from the utilization of the Baxalta retained stake to retire approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt. Interest expense in the quarter was also impacted by a one-time reclassification of capitalized interest from other to interest.
During the second quarter, Baxter completed its disposition of the retained Baxalta equity through a contribution to its U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $700 million and an equity for equity exchange, which reduced Baxter's outstanding share count by approximately 11 million. 
Adjusted other income totaled $13 million in the quarter and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $3 million and dividend income of approximately $7 million associated with our former Baxalta equity stake. 
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.06 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to slightly slower than expected cyclophosphamide sales in the quarter.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. 
Starting with sales. On a constant-currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase between 3% and 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase 1% to 2%. We expect growth in the hospital products business of 3% to 4% or 5% to 6% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide.
Within the hospital products franchise, we now expect sales growth of low double digits for fluid systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide and now expect full year sales of $190 million, with the assumptions that additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%. 
And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to decline low single digits, reflecting a change in our manufacturing service agreement with Shire. Selected products we had previously been manufacturing on their behalf will now be transitioned to self-manufacture by Shire. 
For the renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 3% to 4%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business.
Moving down to P&L. 
We now expect an operating margin of approximately 12%, 100 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting increased sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5% to 21%. We expect the tax rate in second half of the year to increase as the first half benefited from certain discrete items.
For the full year, we anticipate an average share count in the range of 545 to 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share.
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million, resulting in more than $500 million in free cash flow.
Specific to the third quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve 2% to 3%. And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.43 to $0.45 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

We've been looking at significant amount of opportunities. I just reviewed yesterday, we have probably more than 15 different opportunities in our pipeline. But I have to say that we also walked away from 4 deals in the last 90 days. They were too expensive. And we've got to make sure that we have the discipline to execute. We could execute those deals internally. We had absolutely the right teams to get them done. But the price was too high and somebody else is willing to pay more money for that asset. If we don't see a way there, we're not going to be competitive on prices up [ph] deals. I tell you, our focus is to execute, and we have -- having Andy Kidd as part of my operating team, also raised the profile of the M&A jobs in our company, and we're working very hard to find those as we continue to progress in creating operational opportunities for the company, as well as organic opportunities. Our balance sheet is pristine at this moment in time. And so one thing about M&A doesn't preclude us of buying shares back. If shares back, doesn't preclude us from doing M&A.

You look at businesses like the U.S. fluid systems, as you pointed out, and we saw a north of 30% growth in the U.S. Just thinking about that business for a second, there is really 2 primary components to it. One is the infusion systems business, and that's really driven by sales of the Spectrum pump, along with sales of the attendant sets. So once you install a pump and you have the sets that ride along with that. Our sets growth in the quarter was north of 20%, and then the infusion systems overall growth was north of 30%. And then on the other side, we have the IV therapy business in this particular area and that also grew north of 30%. In the case of IV therapy, it was a balanced mix of price and volume that drove the growth. The other area where we saw some pricing in the portfolio is in the area of U.S. PD where we did see some opportunities to capture value. But beyond that, it's a fairly stable pricing environment. I wouldn't say that there are massive or very significant changes to price beyond those 2 areas that I've referenced."

I mean, I think, from the first half to the second half, there are a number of drivers of change. One is, we do have a cyclo impact. In particular in the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see around $40 million of year-over-year decline related to cyclo on the sales line. As it relates to other areas in terms of sales growth, we are taking a very disciplined approach across the portfolio. So as we look at areas where -- that don't earn the right economic return for us, we will very much walk away from particular tenders or businesses. And so in the fourth quarter of this year, there is probably another $30 million to $40 million of low margin sales that we choose to forgo. And then final, the other comments I would make on the third quarter relates to Protopam last year. We did have a Protopam order in the third quarter of last year that makes a tough comparable, that was about $20 million. So if you adjust for those items, I think the sales sort of makes -- is more explainable. Overall, as we think about the guidance on EPS in the second half, if you were to go back to last quarter's earnings call, the implied second half guidance was $0.85 to $0.91 in earnings per share in the second half. As we think about today, our current view is $0.87 to $0.92. So essentially, we've raised the midpoint of the second half guidance by about $0.015. And what you have to realize that there are a couple of drags on the second half number. The tax rate is slightly higher than our expectations, in part because of profitability coming in higher tax jurisdictions, so that's about 1 point. And the share count is a little bit higher -- I should say, $0.01. And then the share count is a little bit higher as well in the second half of the year, so that's about $0.01. We do see a benefit of cyclo of about $0.01, but the ongoing organic base performance that we anticipate improving in the second half is about $0.03 relative to the last time we shared guidance. So overall, I think it's a story of continued momentum, but there are some factors do will slow second half relative to first half."

The other element in the second quarter that was, from my standpoint, very exciting was the area of mix. And so I commented earlier on 20% growth in sets. Sets carry a higher margin than the corporate average. We talked about the acute business, which was just a star performer in the quarter. That too carries a higher margin than the corporate average. We also saw a good growth coming out of anesthesia and nutrition. This idea of accelerating the growth of our higher margin products, that's something that we expect to continue for the balance of this long-range planning period. And that will be one of the contributors that takes us to our aspiration of the 17% to 18% operating margin by 2020. The last comment I would make is, generally speaking, we saw very solid volumes in the first and second quarters, and this accelerated sales growth does have a positive absorption impact on the entire manufacturing and distribution network, which allows us to benefit from higher margins by absorbing more costs. So it really was a confluence of events. We do expect to see continued margin improvements moving forward."

Yes, from a cash flow standpoint, you'll see in the 10-Q when we report it, we're finalizing cash flow for the quarter with PwC working very closely, but we are pleased with the second quarter performance. What I would say as we look for the full year cash flow forecast is the probability of achieving our forecast has increased based on the 2 quarters that we have under our belts. I'm very pleased with the performance. At the Investor Day, we talked about a number of important initiatives that we are embarking on. We just started a days payable project. And one of the comments I made at the Investor Day is the ratio between days payable and days receivable, day sales outstanding, doesn't quite work for us, it's a real opportunity. And I will tell you the early signs of that some of these projects are going very well. But the reason that we haven't changed guidance on cash flow is a lot of our cash flow is back-end loaded due to normal seasonality patterns. And until I get a little bit better line of sight to how Q3 emerges and expectations on Q4, it is a bit premature to raise the cash flow guidance, but I will tell you that the probability of achievement has increased. The other thing I will say is, we have been really focus on CapEx and -- so this is an area where we believe that there is opportunity for us. The 9% of sales is something that we are striving very aggressively to improve. We have long-term plans to do so, but that's another area that as we move towards the end of the year, that may be another area that we update. So on balance, I feel quite good about how the cash flow story is shaping up for our company. And frankly, from a free cash flow standpoint, this is a real opportunity for us not, only this year but moving forward."

And then finally, the acute business has seen outstanding growth in the U.S., in part benefiting from a flu season that extended and was a bit more acute than we previously expected. So there were a number of factors that set the conditions up for success in the U.S. that allowed us to overachieve our expectations and deliver the 10% growth. Outside the U.S., we reported 3% growth internationally. And what I would say is, emerging markets, roughly mid-single digits growth. We did have lower growth in China in the quarter, so low-single digits, in large part, you'll recall, we exited certain tenders for PD where the margins weren't attractive to us, so there was that overhang on our overall business in emerging markets and in China. We do expect to sunset that after this quarter, so we'll see an acceleration, we expect to see in emerging markets in the Q3, Q4 timeframe.

I mean, look, overall, fluid systems business, we anticipate over the next 5 years to be a 3% to 4% grower, although I look at this particular quarter, it's a very solid data point in terms of growth and adoption that we were pleased with. Thinking about the performance of the business, it's important to decompose it into a couple of different segments, right? One is the ID business, and we are working very hard to bring additional volumes to the market. We're very focused on delivering. So as we think about the sustainability of this particular aspect, this should be a steady grower for the next several years, in part because of the contracts that we discussed, but also in part because of continued volume that we look to bring to the U.S. In the other rough we have of the business, the infusion systems area, there's 2 component pieces to this. The larger one today relates to pump sales, so we've had great success with pump business and we continued to perform in line with the expectations or better than with the expectations that we've shared with investors over the last year on pump placements. But then the other benefit is as we place pumps, going with those pumps is a noncapital sale, and that's the set piece, right? So our sets were up, as I said earlier, north of 20% in the quarter, just a very solid element. This becomes more of an annuity or an ongoing stream of business that's related to pumps. And so I would say that's a more sustainable business than the capital sales which are a little bit lumpier in nature, if you will. Overall though, we feel confident that the business will grow, I believe, north of 10% on a full year basis globally. And then moving forward for the next 5 years, this 3 to 4 kind of mid-single digit type growth is what we can expect to see from fluid systems."

And there were a variety of reasons, but it was not meaningful. But when you talk about missing cyclo sales relative to expectations by $5 million, $7 million, that has an impact on both gross margin and EPS. So the margin that we saw was, even in excess from a pure operational standpoint, but look, there are 2 primary factors, right? One is price, so we did see some price benefit in the quarter. But another -- and again, this is the more sort of exciting area as I look at the business, it's an area of mix. So when you have our sets business or acute business, which is $400 million business, our anesthesia business which is, I believe, north of $700 million, our nutrition business, which is also a very healthy size business for us, when you have roughly 20-ish -- 20% of your portfolio growing at a faster rate than the corporate average, and when that has a much higher average margin than the corporate average, it really is a benefit that you see on the gross margin line. In our case, that's something that we experienced in the second quarter. Now turning to the rest of the year, we do expect to see some of that continued benefit from the accelerated growth of those higher-margin businesses. But then there is also a secondary impact, which I referenced earlier, which is as your plants fill up with incremental volume, there is additional absorption that's occurred, the manufacturing network becomes more utilized, so you do see an attendant absorption benefit on the cost profile, which also impacts margin. So second quarter, great. You see price and mix play come into bear. Moving forward, we'll have price mix and volume, and that's why we've been able to increase the guidance in the second half of the year."

Ahead of answering my question, I will say to you that, that there are very few areas of growth if you think about health care and about the targets. The multiples in EBITDA are skyrocketing in some areas, go figure out why. But just saw a couple of deals, one that just got concluded in the U.S., a front end, a generics company, the multiples are extremely high for capability more than anything else because the company did not make any products. So we have those capabilities in-house. We'll look at some of these deals, and we don't see the price, the coherence between pricing them. And I think when we don't see the coherence and does not meet our expectations, we have very established guidelines with our board. They reflect our best interest of our shareholders. I would say we will not step into those deals. We walked away from another deal. They had a significant difference between us and a foreign party was strengthened by the company. There is not a deal that is important enough that will make us spend our shareholders' money in vain. So we're going to continue to pursue, there are a couple deals on the table right now that we think are actionable. We're pursuing them, but we're going to always keep our eyes on value."

Overall, from a volume standpoint, we don't expect an impact from some of the macro challenges we're seeing in Europe. Most of our product lines are more steady stream from a unit standpoint, so we don't really anticipate an impact in that sense. From a foreign exchange standpoint, really, we have a number of hedges and opportunities that we have. So as it relates to the U.K., we have roughly 5% of our sales in the U.K. We do have a manufacturing plant in the U.K. that provides natural hedge against fluctuations in that currency. And then in the Eurozone area, we have a number of plants. So as the euro moves, we do have natural offsets to sales, the currency fluctuations in that market as well. But the other thing that we do is, we use synthetic hedges or derivatives, principally options, to hedge foreign currency exposure. And we have a well disciplined approach where we hedge out up to 5 or 6 quarters. We hedge roughly 20% per quarter. And we use options which really caps the downside associated with those instruments. Now for us, as we evaluated the Brexit situation leading up to that particular event, we actually did a couple of things. We increased our exposure or increased our derivative positions on the pound and increased our derivative positions on the euro as well as an insurance policy to ensure that there will be no adverse impact this year or next year. And so the result of that is, despite the movement in the pound and the euro, we really offset some of the translational impact of the P&L with gains associated with those derivatives that we put in place, and we're very pleased with the situation that we're currently in. The other item that we did is, as the yen strengthened, we did take the opportunity to increase some of our exposure, again, using options so that the downside is limited to the yen. So we hedged some of our incremental yen positions at basically JPN 100 to $1. Again, a trade that we were pleased with and situated as well for both this year and next year from a foreign exchange risk standpoint."

I would say, when we move away from emerging markets, developed markets, such as Australia, a very strong growth, good performance and we see our markets there for areas like hospital admissions, we see that via our compounding business there that is doing very well, no issues. I would say, Europe is always a point of attention with very slow growth in most of the 5 large countries in Europe, with some exceptions in parts of -- probably even in Spain, we see a little bit of growth there, but it's a market that we are being very careful with how we compete.

So it's a very good underlying market growth. Second is, there was a supply issue in the marketplace, primarily in the U.S., and Baxter is always there for our customers. We're able to supply products for our patients. And by doing this so, we were able to help our hospitals, as well as create some momentum and potential conversion opportunities of those accounts, because not all of them probably will go back to the original manufacturer who was in that quarter and shorten the market. So we'll be able to pick that up in the near future. So it is a great business for us, hence, our ability to continue to tag other technologies like PrismaLung and the other things that we've spoken in May at our Investor Day because it's a real door opener into the ICU for us."

This is our first earnings announcement since our May Investor Conference, and the strategies we outlined at that time are clearly gaining traction. We are making steady progress in our efforts to enhance our financial performance through our disciplined focus on portfolio and innovation management, operational excellence and capital allocation. As you've seen in our press release, Baxter delivered strong topline and bottom-line results in the second quarter, exceeding expectations. 
I will share a few comments on our progress and then turn it over to Jay who will provide more details on the quarter and our updated financial outlook. After that, we will open the call for Q&A.
So let's get started. 
Baxter's worldwide sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% on a reported basis. Sales growth was driven by a strong performance in the U.S. Fluid Systems, U.S. Peritoneal Dialysis and global acute care renal therapies. On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, reflecting a benefit of better than expected sales growth, favorable product mix and the positive impact of our continuing business transformation efforts.
Now I'll briefly walk you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where we speak to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding foreign exchange, to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.
Global sales for hospital products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 7%. Excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide sales, hospital product sales increased 13% in the U.S. and 9% globally.
Now to break out hospital products at the franchise level. Sales in fluid systems were $586 million, up 15%. Growth continues to reflect the strong launch of the SIGMA Spectrum infusion system in the U.S., where we continued to gain market share, plus favorable demand in pricing in U.S. for IV solutions.
Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, increasing 4%. Growth, excluding cyclophosphamide, was up 8%, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by solid performance across nutritional products, Pharma injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services. With surgical care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, sales totaled $347 million, up 5% year-over-year. We continued to view biosurgery as an attractive opportunity for growth through both innovation and geographic expansion. In the quarter, biosurgery sales increased mid-single digits globally. Sales continued to be impacted by lower sales of selected non-core biosurgery products, Actifuse and Peri-Strips, which depressed the growth in the quarter by approximately 2 percentage points. As we discussed at our May Investor Conference, we continued to focus on strengthening this portfolio through the introduction of new products and delivery devices, expanded indications and continued geographic expansion. 
During the quarter, we expanded the launch of HEMOPATCH, our advanced surgical patch to Brazil, Mexico and New Zealand. HEMOPATCH provides surgeons in these markets in new ready-to-use option that has broad indications as an advanced surgical patch.
Our line of inhaled anesthetics continued to lead the market globally, with second quarter sales up 7%, globally driven by double-digit growth internationally where we continued to leverage our array of high-quality well-trusted anesthetics as a platform for continued geographic expansion.
During the quarter, revenues in the biopharma services partnering business totaled $124 million, a decline of 5% as expected. As previously mentioned, growth in the business has been impacted by a customer electing to take manufacturing in-house.
Next, turning to our renal business. Global renal sales were $965 million, up 4%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, where our highly innovative AMIA APD cycler featuring SHARESOURCE 2-way online connectivity continues to build momentum in the marketplace. There are already more than 500 patients on AMIA in the U.S. today, which have provided a well over 30,000 treatments taking advantage of our cloud-based platform for remote patient therapy management.
In addition, during the second quarter, AMIA with SHARESOURCE was also approved in Canada, representing a new frontier for growth. Renal growth in the quarter also benefited from a strong growth in acute business, driven by increased market adoption for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT as a treatment for acute kidney injuries. Performance in the quarter also benefited from a strong flu season and competitive supply issues. We're very excited about the opportunities for this business, which remains one of our fastest-growing areas and an active area of focus moving forward. Our leading Prismaflex platform was recently approved in China. And we've initiated launch of our PrismaLung low-flow carbon dioxide removal device in France, Germany and Sweden.
Growth in the in-center HD business declined in the core as we continued to take a targeted approach to how we manage this business, including being selective about what market and tenders we need to participate and to support our objective of improving profitability in this business. 
Before concluding, I would share a quick leadership update. Over the past few weeks, several outstanding executives have joined Baxter's senior leadership team. These include Giuseppe Accogli, the new appointed President of our Renal business; Stacey Eisen [ph], our new Vice President of Corporate Communications; Scott Pleau, our new Vice President of Operations; and finally, Andy Kidd, our Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. And Andy will lead Baxter's effort to accelerate activities in the area of strategy and business development to augment our growth aspirations. The entire team, those you met in May and our most recent additions share my passion for Baxter's mission and a sense of urgency to drive transformation to pursue a top quartile performance. I have the utmost confidence in them as individuals and as a highly unified team to deliver on the potential that lies ahead for the company and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we will have time at the end for questions. Jay?"

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results. It's another important building block as we look to achieve our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 6% in the quarter, and on a reported basis, sales grew 4%. Growth came in 2 points above our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in fluid systems, acute renal and anesthesia. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. 
Adjusted gross margin of 43.8% also compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix and improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $663 million and decreased 11% on a reported basis. This represents a 440 basis points year-over-year improvement. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the rebasing of our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta-Shire. 
TSA income totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these services ramps down. We expect TSA income in the second half of 2016 to be approximately $50 million compared to $65 million in the second half of 2015.
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $150 million increased to 1% versus the prior year. As we had previously announced, we discontinued our investment in the VIVIA home hemodialysis program in the second quarter. We plan to reinvest that spending into new programs in PD, biosurgery and other initiatives to fuel future growth.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.3% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by increased sales, positive product mix and continued discipline around expense management. This represents a 530 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2015.
Interest expense was $11 million in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of lower debt balances resulting from the utilization of the Baxalta retained stake to retire approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt. Interest expense in the quarter was also impacted by a one-time reclassification of capitalized interest from other to interest.
During the second quarter, Baxter completed its disposition of the retained Baxalta equity through a contribution to its U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $700 million and an equity for equity exchange, which reduced Baxter's outstanding share count by approximately 11 million. 
Adjusted other income totaled $13 million in the quarter and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $3 million and dividend income of approximately $7 million associated with our former Baxalta equity stake. 
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.06 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to slightly slower than expected cyclophosphamide sales in the quarter.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. 
Starting with sales. On a constant-currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase between 3% and 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase 1% to 2%. We expect growth in the hospital products business of 3% to 4% or 5% to 6% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide.
Within the hospital products franchise, we now expect sales growth of low double digits for fluid systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide and now expect full year sales of $190 million, with the assumptions that additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%. 
And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to decline low single digits, reflecting a change in our manufacturing service agreement with Shire. Selected products we had previously been manufacturing on their behalf will now be transitioned to self-manufacture by Shire. 
For the renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 3% to 4%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business.
Moving down to P&L. 
We now expect an operating margin of approximately 12%, 100 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting increased sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5% to 21%. We expect the tax rate in second half of the year to increase as the first half benefited from certain discrete items.
For the full year, we anticipate an average share count in the range of 545 to 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share.
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million, resulting in more than $500 million in free cash flow.
Specific to the third quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve 2% to 3%. And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.43 to $0.45 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

We've been looking at significant amount of opportunities. I just reviewed yesterday, we have probably more than 15 different opportunities in our pipeline. But I have to say that we also walked away from 4 deals in the last 90 days. They were too expensive. And we've got to make sure that we have the discipline to execute. We could execute those deals internally. We had absolutely the right teams to get them done. But the price was too high and somebody else is willing to pay more money for that asset. If we don't see a way there, we're not going to be competitive on prices up [ph] deals. I tell you, our focus is to execute, and we have -- having Andy Kidd as part of my operating team, also raised the profile of the M&A jobs in our company, and we're working very hard to find those as we continue to progress in creating operational opportunities for the company, as well as organic opportunities. Our balance sheet is pristine at this moment in time. And so one thing about M&A doesn't preclude us of buying shares back. If shares back, doesn't preclude us from doing M&A.

Generally, you're right, it was a great quarter from a sales perspective. You look at businesses like the U.S. fluid systems, as you pointed out, and we saw a north of 30% growth in the U.S. Just thinking about that business for a second, there is really 2 primary components to it. One is the infusion systems business, and that's really driven by sales of the Spectrum pump, along with sales of the attendant sets. So once you install a pump and you have the sets that ride along with that. Our sets growth in the quarter was north of 20%, and then the infusion systems overall growth was north of 30%. And then on the other side, we have the IV therapy business in this particular area and that also grew north of 30%. In the case of IV therapy, it was a balanced mix of price and volume that drove the growth. The other area where we saw some pricing in the portfolio is in the area of U.S. PD where we did see some opportunities to capture value. But beyond that, it's a fairly stable pricing environment. I wouldn't say that there are massive or very significant changes to price beyond those 2 areas that I've referenced."

I mean, I think, from the first half to the second half, there are a number of drivers of change. One is, we do have a cyclo impact. In particular in the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see around $40 million of year-over-year decline related to cyclo on the sales line. As it relates to other areas in terms of sales growth, we are taking a very disciplined approach across the portfolio. So as we look at areas where -- that don't earn the right economic return for us, we will very much walk away from particular tenders or businesses. And so in the fourth quarter of this year, there is probably another $30 million to $40 million of low margin sales that we choose to forgo. And then final, the other comments I would make on the third quarter relates to Protopam last year. We did have a Protopam order in the third quarter of last year that makes a tough comparable, that was about $20 million. So if you adjust for those items, I think the sales sort of makes -- is more explainable. Overall, as we think about the guidance on EPS in the second half, if you were to go back to last quarter's earnings call, the implied second half guidance was $0.85 to $0.91 in earnings per share in the second half. As we think about today, our current view is $0.87 to $0.92. So essentially, we've raised the midpoint of the second half guidance by about $0.015. And what you have to realize that there are a couple of drags on the second half number. The tax rate is slightly higher than our expectations, in part because of profitability coming in higher tax jurisdictions, so that's about 1 point. And the share count is a little bit higher -- I should say, $0.01. And then the share count is a little bit higher as well in the second half of the year, so that's about $0.01. We do see a benefit of cyclo of about $0.01, but the ongoing organic base performance that we anticipate improving in the second half is about $0.03 relative to the last time we shared guidance. So overall, I think it's a story of continued momentum, but there are some factors do will slow second half relative to first half."

And as we think about what drove margin in the second quarter and what drives it to the balance of the year, gross margin that is, there is the price, net price positive impact that we've seen in the quarter. So that's one element. Now importantly, we've signed many of our agreements. We've concluded many of the agreements in a variety of our businesses. So as we move to next year, we don't expect to see the same level of price or economic value capture that we have experienced, but there are still some opportunities for pricing. The other element in the second quarter that was, from my standpoint, very exciting was the area of mix. And so I commented earlier on 20% growth in sets. Sets carry a higher margin than the corporate average. We talked about the acute business, which was just a star performer in the quarter. That too carries a higher margin than the corporate average. We also saw a good growth coming out of anesthesia and nutrition. This idea of accelerating the growth of our higher margin products, that's something that we expect to continue for the balance of this long-range planning period. And that will be one of the contributors that takes us to our aspiration of the 17% to 18% operating margin by 2020. The last comment I would make is, generally speaking, we saw very solid volumes in the first and second quarters, and this accelerated sales growth does have a positive absorption impact on the entire manufacturing and distribution network, which allows us to benefit from higher margins by absorbing more costs. So it really was a confluence of events. We do expect to see continued margin improvements moving forward."

What I would say as we look for the full year cash flow forecast is the probability of achieving our forecast has increased based on the 2 quarters that we have under our belts. I'm very pleased with the performance. At the Investor Day, we talked about a number of important initiatives that we are embarking on. We just started a days payable project. And one of the comments I made at the Investor Day is the ratio between days payable and days receivable, day sales outstanding, doesn't quite work for us, it's a real opportunity. And I will tell you the early signs of that some of these projects are going very well. But the reason that we haven't changed guidance on cash flow is a lot of our cash flow is back-end loaded due to normal seasonality patterns. And until I get a little bit better line of sight to how Q3 emerges and expectations on Q4, it is a bit premature to raise the cash flow guidance, but I will tell you that the probability of achievement has increased. The other thing I will say is, we have been really focus on CapEx and -- so this is an area where we believe that there is opportunity for us. The 9% of sales is something that we are striving very aggressively to improve. We have long-term plans to do so, but that's another area that as we move towards the end of the year, that may be another area that we update. So on balance, I feel quite good about how the cash flow story is shaping up for our company.

So we have slowed down the price erosion in dialyzers. So all in all, the company is looking at price neutral to slightly positive going forward versus any negative price pressure or erosion. So just again, price neutral to positive going forward."

And then the U.S. PD business also benefits from AMIA and also some of the execution that we are seeing overall in the U.S. PD business. And then finally, the acute business has seen outstanding growth in the U.S., in part benefiting from a flu season that extended and was a bit more acute than we previously expected. So there were a number of factors that set the conditions up for success in the U.S. that allowed us to overachieve our expectations and deliver the 10% growth. Outside the U.S., we reported 3% growth internationally. And what I would say is, emerging markets, roughly mid-single digits growth. We did have lower growth in China in the quarter, so low-single digits, in large part, you'll recall, we exited certain tenders for PD where the margins weren't attractive to us, so there was that overhang on our overall business in emerging markets and in China. We do expect to sunset that after this quarter, so we'll see an acceleration, we expect to see in emerging markets in the Q3, Q4 timeframe. So those would be a few of the overall comments I would make on that."

I mean, look, overall, fluid systems business, we anticipate over the next 5 years to be a 3% to 4% grower, although I look at this particular quarter, it's a very solid data point in terms of growth and adoption that we were pleased with. Thinking about the performance of the business, it's important to decompose it into a couple of different segments, right? One is the ID business, and we are working very hard to bring additional volumes to the market. We're very focused on delivering. So as we think about the sustainability of this particular aspect, this should be a steady grower for the next several years, in part because of the contracts that we discussed, but also in part because of continued volume that we look to bring to the U.S. In the other rough we have of the business, the infusion systems area, there's 2 component pieces to this. The larger one today relates to pump sales, so we've had great success with pump business and we continued to perform in line with the expectations or better than with the expectations that we've shared with investors over the last year on pump placements. But then the other benefit is as we place pumps, going with those pumps is a noncapital sale, and that's the set piece, right? So our sets were up, as I said earlier, north of 20% in the quarter, just a very solid element. This becomes more of an annuity or an ongoing stream of business that's related to pumps. And so I would say that's a more sustainable business than the capital sales which are a little bit lumpier in nature, if you will. Overall though, we feel confident that the business will grow, I believe, north of 10% on a full year basis globally. And then moving forward for the next 5 years, this 3 to 4 kind of mid-single digit type growth is what we can expect to see from fluid systems."

And there were a variety of reasons, but it was not meaningful. But when you talk about missing cyclo sales relative to expectations by $5 million, $7 million, that has an impact on both gross margin and EPS. So the margin that we saw was, even in excess from a pure operational standpoint, but look, there are 2 primary factors, right? One is price, so we did see some price benefit in the quarter. But another -- and again, this is the more sort of exciting area as I look at the business, it's an area of mix. So when you have our sets business or acute business, which is $400 million business, our anesthesia business which is, I believe, north of $700 million, our nutrition business, which is also a very healthy size business for us, when you have roughly 20-ish -- 20% of your portfolio growing at a faster rate than the corporate average, and when that has a much higher average margin than the corporate average, it really is a benefit that you see on the gross margin line. In our case, that's something that we experienced in the second quarter. Now turning to the rest of the year, we do expect to see some of that continued benefit from the accelerated growth of those higher-margin businesses. But then there is also a secondary impact, which I referenced earlier, which is as your plants fill up with incremental volume, there is additional absorption that's occurred, the manufacturing network becomes more utilized, so you do see an attendant absorption benefit on the cost profile, which also impacts margin. So second quarter, great. You see price and mix play come into bear. Moving forward, we'll have price mix and volume, and that's why we've been able to increase the guidance in the second half of the year."

Overall, from a volume standpoint, we don't expect an impact from some of the macro challenges we're seeing in Europe. Most of our product lines are more steady stream from a unit standpoint, so we don't really anticipate an impact in that sense. From a foreign exchange standpoint, really, we have a number of hedges and opportunities that we have. So as it relates to the U.K., we have roughly 5% of our sales in the U.K. We do have a manufacturing plant in the U.K. that provides natural hedge against fluctuations in that currency. And then in the Eurozone area, we have a number of plants. So as the euro moves, we do have natural offsets to sales, the currency fluctuations in that market as well. But the other thing that we do is, we use synthetic hedges or derivatives, principally options, to hedge foreign currency exposure. And we have a well disciplined approach where we hedge out up to 5 or 6 quarters. We hedge roughly 20% per quarter. And we use options which really caps the downside associated with those instruments. Now for us, as we evaluated the Brexit situation leading up to that particular event, we actually did a couple of things. We increased our exposure or increased our derivative positions on the pound and increased our derivative positions on the euro as well as an insurance policy to ensure that there will be no adverse impact this year or next year. And so the result of that is, despite the movement in the pound and the euro, we really offset some of the translational impact of the P&L with gains associated with those derivatives that we put in place, and we're very pleased with the situation that we're currently in. The other item that we did is, as the yen strengthened, we did take the opportunity to increase some of our exposure, again, using options so that the downside is limited to the yen. So we hedged some of our incremental yen positions at basically JPN 100 to $1. Again, a trade that we were pleased with and situated as well for both this year and next year from a foreign exchange risk standpoint."

We are very disciplined in pricing, but we see that market being more tenuous than the rest of the developed markets."

So it's a very good underlying market growth. Second is, there was a supply issue in the marketplace, primarily in the U.S., and Baxter is always there for our customers. We're able to supply products for our patients. And by doing this so, we were able to help our hospitals, as well as create some momentum and potential conversion opportunities of those accounts, because not all of them probably will go back to the original manufacturer who was in that quarter and shorten the market. So we'll be able to pick that up in the near future. So it is a great business for us, hence, our ability to continue to tag other technologies like PrismaLung and the other things that we've spoken in May at our Investor Day because it's a real door opener into the ICU for us."

I will begin this morning by sharing some comments on our performance and progress. Then I will turn it over to Jay who will take a closer look at the financials and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. After that, we'll open up for Q&A. 
We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We continue to see momentum building across the organization as we implement the strategies outlined at our investor conference to enhance financial performance through reshaping our portfolio, transforming our cost structure and effectively deploying capital. 
As you saw in our press release, Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. These results were driven by continued strong performance of Fluid Systems in U.S. and peritoneal dialysis and acute renal therapies globally. 
Adjusting Baxter's results for the impact of cyclophosphamide and last year's $20 million order of PROTOPAM, sales in the quarter increased 6% globally. 
On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share. This reflects the benefit of solid sales growth, along with our ongoing focus on expense management and operational excellence. 
Now take you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where I will address sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance. 
Global sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 3%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, Hospital Products sales advanced 7% globally, reflecting 13% growth in the U.S. and 1% growth internationally. 
Now to break out Hospital Products at a franchise level. Sales in Fluid Systems totaled $576 million, up 11%. These results reflect continued strength in the U.S., driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions, along with strong growth in accesses [ph] resulting from the ongoing successful launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM.  Note that this quarter, we anniversary the launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM, which is continuing to drive solid performance and increased market share. 
Next, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, decreasing 4%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, sales increased 6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by U.S. nutrition, which benefited from strong sales of vitamins and amino acids, as well as our recently launched premixed generic injectable, Cefazolin and VANCOMYCIN saline. In addition, this quarter, we launched NUMETA G13E in Europe. This expand our NUMETA pediatric line with the only ready-to-use triple-chamber IV nutrition product for preterm infants.  NUMETA utilizes Baxter's proprietary olive oil-based lipid, which has been shown to be immunoneutral, thereby reducing the risk of inflammation for the patient. Baxter is the only manufacturer to utilize olive oil-based lipids as part of our multichambered nutritional product offering. 
Moving to Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products. Third quarter sales totaled $320 million. Global growth in the quarter was flat to the prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in biosurgery, offset by lower sales of anesthesia products. Anesthesia was impacted by the timing of certain governmental austerity measures in Europe and the timing of certain shipments internationally. 
Our industry-leading inhaled anesthetics portfolio continues to represent a solid platform for future growth and global expansion. 
Finally, in Hospital Products. BioPharma Solutions, our contract manufacturing business, generated sales of $122 million, an increase of 15%. This growth reflects the benefit of an easier comp for the prior year, along with increased customer demand for products produced in our cytotoxic manufacturing facility in Germany. 
Turning next to our Renal business. Renal sales were $977 million globally, up 6%. This reflects ongoing momentum in peritoneal dialysis or PD, which delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth internationally. PD growth is being driven by an expanding patient base, favorable pricing in U.S. and the ongoing launches of our new APD cycler, AMIA in the U.S. and HOMECHOICE CLARIA outside the U.S. These systems feature our innovative SHARESOURCE technology, which was also recently approved in Japan. SHARESOURCE will be a defining feature for our new Kaguya APD cycler in Japan, which we expect to gain local market approval shortly. 
Additionally, Q3 results reflect the positive impact of our acute renal business, which delivered double-digit growth globally. This reflects growing global demand for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT, which we're well positioned to address with our market-leading Prismaflex platform. Acute care is a fast-growing market where we have a substantial opportunity to serve patients and clinicians with high-value products. So this will remain a growing area of emphasis as we look ahead. 
Growth in Renal was somewhat offset by performance in in-center hemodialysis. We're taking a deliberate approach to improving profitability in our HD business. As you may have seen in our press release yesterday, we launched our novel and proprietary HDx therapy, enabled by our differentiated Theranova dialyzer. 
HDx therapy with Theranova has the potential to improve outcomes and raise the standard of treatment for end-stage renal disease patients. It has just launched in France, Australia and New Zealand and will launch in several other Western European markets before the end of the year. 
That's a brief snapshot of our Q3 results. I would like to close my comments by putting our quarterly performance in a broader, strategic context.  At our investor conference in May, we identified 3 critical drivers that would elevate our performance to top quartile levels: portfolio innovation management; operational excellent -- excellence rather,  excellence; capital allocation. [ph] The results we have seen year-to-date reflect the progress we have made across these 3 levers. 
In portfolio and innovation management, we have selectively exited products from certain global markets when our presence and potential are no longer in line with our go-forward strategy, while ensuring these markets continue to have alternate care options available for the patients. 
We have also continued our candid assessment of legacy [ph] R&D. This continues [ph] several programs either in noncore areas or where our prospects did not merit projected resources and demands.  Choices like these are enabling us to refocus our investment on high-potential, high-value R&D and on a more strategic sales and marketing opportunities in biosurgery, PD nutrition, premixed injectables and more. 
The third quarter results to a [ph] pivotal quarter in our cost transformation efforts. In recent months, we have executed plans to rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure or sale of a number of facilities in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. These actions will streamline and simplify our operations and better position us to manage costs while continuing to address patient and customer needs across the globe. 
And earlier this month, we began a wave of organizational restructuring in our global commercial operations and certain other functions, which was the outcome of a rigorous zero-based organizational assessment. These streamlining is expected to generate a higher-performing organization, along with cost savings that we contemplated in our May investor conference. 
Efforts like this support a leaner cost base and, again, the opportunity to channel [ph] investment in new ways. Innovation is our -- is, of course, the most crucial ingredient in our ongoing success. And you will continue to see capital allocation choices that reinvest [ph] in the business to bolster R&D as well as ongoing sustainable top line growth and margin expansion.  And as you have heard me say repeatedly, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities in our core growth areas and high-potential adjacencies. Any likely [ph] news in this front should be interpreted as a sign of our discipline in assessing deals with strategic fit and financial merit. 
So in sum, our success this quarter represents significant progress on our strategic journey. And while we are pleased, we're not satisfied. We will continue to make progress on our journey to transform Baxter into a top-quartile company. 
And with that, I will turn over to Jay who will walk you through the financials. Then we'll open it up for your questions."

Walking through the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 44.9% represents an improvement of more than 100 basis points over the prior year, driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and favorable manufacturing performance in the quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $611 million and decreased 9% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the benefit from lower pension expense. 
TSA income totaled approximately $25 million in the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as need for these services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. 
During the third quarter, we did report a charge of approximately $130 million for restructuring activities, of which approximately $100 million was related to employee termination costs, which are expected to generate over $100 million of annual savings once fully implemented. As Joe mentioned, these actions were initiated earlier this month and were contemplated in the long-term financial guidance we provided in May. We will continue to optimize our cost structure as we move forward. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. While we did benefit in the quarter from the discontinuation of selected [ph] programs, we expect to begin redeploying that spend in areas like biosurgery and premixed injectables beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by positive product mix, lower R&D spend and the benefit of our initiatives to control spending and reduce expenses. This represents a 480 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense was $14 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and executed a $1.6 billion 3-tranche debt offering consisting of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes. Proceeds from this offering were used to retire a series of existing bonds maturing in the near to intermediate term as well as pay off all of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the transaction, Baxter's bond maturity profile increased from an average of 9 years to 15 years, and our average coupon rate declined by nearly 1%. 
Adjusted other income totaled $4 million in the quarter, primarily resulting from a foreign exchange gain on a balance sheet position. The adjusted tax rate was 22% for the quarter, slightly higher than expectations, driven by earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.43 to $0.45 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.11 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to a higher share count and tax rate. 
Along with our equity-for-equity exchange, which we executed in the latter part of the second quarter, during the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $40 million or approximately 1 million shares during the quarter. These repurchases were more than offset by higher-than-expected option-related [ph] dilution given Baxter's stock performance during the quarter. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales. On a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%. 
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 2%. We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 3% to 4% or approximately 5%, excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of low double digits for Fluid Systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline versus the prior year, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclo and now expect full year sales of $210 million with the assumption that no additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016.  After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales were expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS or 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of both cyclo and PROTOPAM. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow approximately 1%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to increase low single digits. 
For the Renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 4% to 5%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 13%, a 100 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance and a 200 basis point improvement relative to our original guidance. This increase is driven by improved sales and [ph] ongoing discipline [ph] management of expenses. 
We expect interest expense to total approximately $70 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $55 million, which does not reflect -- which does reflect a benefit of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to the disposition of an equity investment. 
For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 21%, driven by the expected mix of earnings. For full year 2016, we anticipate an average share count of 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.88 to $1.91 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share. 
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion and CapEx of approximately $800 million, resulting in approximately $650 million in free cash flow. This represents an increase of 30% from our original guidance of $500 million. 
We're applying the same discipline to managing capital expenditures as we are to our expense base, which has resulted in a benefit of approximately $100 million in lower CapEx for the year. In addition, we have kicked -- we have initiated programs focused on improving our days payable and days receivable ratios, which will benefit operating cash flow going forward. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The growth does represent a deceleration from previous quarters given our previously announced decision to exit select markets outside the U.S.  The collective impact of these exits impacted top line by approximately 1 percentage point. In addition, lower cyclo sales compared to the prior year also negatively impacted top line by approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter.  Adjusting for these 2 factors, growth in the quarter would be approximately 4%, which is in line with our long-term projections. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share. This guidance reflects increased investments in R&D and incremental investments in SG&A. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

Good morning, David, so as far as the fourth quarter goes, overall, we were obviously very pleased with the margin performance in the third quarter. So 16% represents the highest quarterly margin target that we've achieved the since the spinoff. As we move to Q4, we do expect a slight downtick on the operating margin of the business and really, there's a couple of drivers to that. One is, we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments in both biosurgery and remixed injectables, as I mentioned. So that will be 1 factor that increases the R&D spending relative to our current level. And then the second item relates to SG&A. We do expect a slight uptick as well in SG&A in the fourth quarter as a percent of sales. There's a couple of factors going on there. One is we do have historic seasonality, so if you look at Baxter over the last many years, we have normally have an up tick in spending in the fourth quarter. We do expect that to repeat. And then the second factor that's going on with respect to SG&A is one of the topics we discussed in our May investor conference relates to what we call local initiatives. The idea that given the diverse geographic portfolio that we have in place and the product portfolio, we really have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by unlocking some of the entrepreneurial spirit outside of the U.S. But frankly, that comes with it an SG&A cost. So over the course of the last quarter, we have approved a number of investment initiatives, which we will we believe will benefit 2017 and '18 but do have a slight cost associated with them. So for these reasons, we do expect a slight downtick as it relates to the overall margin. But again, feel very confident in the operational performance. As we look to 2017, I think, it's too early to get into forecast for 2017. What I can tell you is in our May investor conference, we shared a series of projections for 2018 and 2020. And it is clear, the the data points that we have point to [ph] performance relative to those expectations. So we have a higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers and exceed those numbers today than we did when we shared them in May of 2016."

One of the numbers that I think, the team is most proud of is the cash and free cash flow performance. As I mentioned, in the script, the increase it from $500 million to $650 million and really there's a couple of different components to that. One is, operating cash flow, we're raising approximately $50 million. And this is an area where I believe that will be more substantial benefit from some of the programs that we've initiative this year in future years. So we're spending a lot of time as a team on working capital. Days payable, day sales outstanding an inventory, how can we drive that down? And those are balances that you don't switch on overnight. That over time, with to recur in focus, you can drive real result in these categories. So we don't really have much benefit this year but 2017, we think, own I didn't, he will expect to some meaningful working capital improvements. Where we were able to drive an impact this year and frankly I believe this will be sustainable, A's in CapEx. We did a couple of things this year, which I think, provided a very real benefit. First, we did as 0 based budget for CapEx, which we review quarterly with our senior leadership team space our top Executive of the company sitdown on a quarterly basis. And the result of that is twofold, 1, we did cancel a number of low value-added programs but second, for every single program that we have, the challenge to the team was how can we do this more cost-effectively? And the results were very, very impressive. So the second piece relates to an incentive change that we put in place at the beginning of the year. For our top employees, we have a short-term incentive plan for the top several thousand employees. And last year, there was no cash flow component to this. This year, recognizing the challenge that we face with CapEx being 9% of sales, we installed a free cash flow trigger for our short-term incentive plan by focusing on free cash flow now, we have are either organization geared and charging towards drive improvements in this important metric. So while that's harder to quantify, I believe that, that's paid a real dividend in our numbers and creativity as we think about addressing CapEx spending. But frankly, this is 1 area where, I believe, we have achieved a new normal and will continue to drive performance from here."

And I would say it was contributing to it for gross margin, SG&A leverage and some R&D leverage. From a gross margin standpoint, let's start with that. There were a number of factors in play. We've talked a lot about this concept of portfolio management and business mix and upgrading the business mix. And as we look at the Q3 results from Baxter, you start to see that story playing out. So for example, we saw a very strong performance in our U.S. hospital business in the Sunseri and access. Our sets in the United States grew approximately 20%. That simple business mix factor contributed to our margin. And as we increase the install base in the United States of SIGMA SPECTRUM, we'll continue to benefit from this mix factor as it moves forward. From an international standpoint, you'll see that we have lower Fluid Systems sales. But in areas like, Renal in particular, where we had double-digit acute growth and PD growth, where we are very focused on accelerating growth, those are 2 good margin areas that provided uplift from a business mix standpoint. And finally, from a business mix standpoint, you heard Joe comment earlier in this call about how we're going to manage incent HD for profitability, very focused on driving this. So while that business had lower sales, it had a business mix and from our standpoint, the focus on profitability. Those are the 3 examples from a gross margin standpoint where business mix played an impact. The second comment related to gross margin is manufacturing and performance. Overall, we had solid manufacturing performance. We have good volumes in Q2 and Q3. The result of that is a P&L benefit from a manufacturing standpoint. We'll expect to continue driving manufacturing performance going forward. This is a real area of focus for us. How can we effectively you device our facilities. In Joe's prepared remarks, you heard him reference, we've closed or sold a number of facilities over the course of this year. That leads to better leverage of the network. The final piece related to gross margin is this idea of how can we think creatively about our business arrangements, either through pricing or being thoughtful about the services that we provide. A simple example of this is we're really focusing our U.S. Renal business on limiting the amount of overnight shipping that occurs. For us, that has historically been a real cost that we won and it's impacted our margin by focusing on that, were able to drive a better margin. So those are the 3 drivers that have impacted our gross margin. Moving to our in the. We made a couple of tough decisions over the course of this year with respect to project, a project like VIVIA. And so as a result of that, we saw lower R&D spending in the quarter. Now to my earlier comment, I do expect an uptick in this as we start to reinvest in some exciting new areas for us that have near term paybacks than the VIVIA project. But in the quarter, this idea of rigorous capital allocation did play out in the are in the spend. And then finally, from the SG&A standpoint, I would make a couple of comments here. First, this idea of zero-based spending challenging every single dollar that we have in place. That's something that the company has other up dead from a process standpoint. So was we went through our budgeting process this year, we had a very rigorous zero-based spending approach, zero-based organization approach in place applying these techniques to our cost structure. But I think beyond that, culturally, the entire organization is incredibly aware of spending and driving results. The number of ideas that we're generating from our organization at large with respect to simplification, with respect to savings ideas is remarkable. And that simple phenomena has played out in our SG&A numbers for the quarter."

While we don't -- we're not anticipating an incremental competitor in cyclophosphamide, we do expect a lower level than prior years, down about $20 million or roughly 1 point of growth to $45 million in the quarter. So that's a deceleration that we've expected and kind of consistent with how we thought about things. As we look at the other area that, that has impacted our Q4 results, we have always talked about this idea of rigorously going through our portfolio and ensuring that every single sale that we make is one that contributes positively to the economics of Baxter. And so in support of that, we did walk away from roughly $130 million in sales on an annual basis, which amounts to roughly 1 point of growth impact in the quarter. Now the good news is this has limited to no impact on the bottom line. The sales were essentially breakeven and we've been able to eliminate all the cost associated with those sales. So while on the bottom line there's no impact, it does impact the top line a bit. If I were to adjust for these 2 factors, the 2% growth would be more like our normal expected run rate growth of 4%."

First thing we did was completely reallocate capital. If I show today to you the dollars invested by franchise in the company versus 12 months ago, you see a significant difference. We are doubling down in areas like BioSurgery. It's going to take us a couple of years though pickup momentum with her because we fell behind a couple of different things but we're looking at some M&A augmentation for the short term. We also are doubling down in the PD business. In fact in our peritoneal dialysis business, we have great confidence that we're going to unveil a very different model of doing business in some parts of the world. We're working with Bayer at this moment and I think that will be a very interesting way of expanding the use of PD, which has proven to be economically and from the access point of view, a better way forward for the patient and for the system. And with SHARESOURCE, we're going to continue to invest there. I see us very focused on the M&A area associated with organic growth in our generic injectables business. We think we have a platform of opportunity at the moment plus our internal growth and shins in terms of new molecules, which were accelerating. so all of these gives me the confidence that we can achieve 4% to 5% in a couple of years. I tell you, though, we are trimming our portfolio where we're moving a significant amount of unprofitable dollars, which would boost our 2017 bottom line. But clearly the portfolio and simply simplifying Baxter is also part of the playbook. So the playbook is innovation, really good capital allocation practices use capital dollars in the way that it was different in the past. As you can see, our free cash flow numbers will allow us to generate more profitability for the company. And lastly, when we talk about transformations, not just cost reduction and reduction of personnel but also the complete restructuring of the company in terms of its processes, Baxter grew up to be a very complicated company with a lot of SKUs, and we're working very hard to the office of the business transformation to redo that. So that accumulation of factors give us a the good odds of hitting the numbers. We just need to continue forth with a lot of tenacity to achieve what we set forth to do."

Do we have price increases? We do have rights increases like many companies. But the sustainability, what I see in the long term is neutral to possible prices, so I want to make that very clear. The other thing is how do you sustain that top line with transforming the gross margin contribution and participating in markets that have higher growth rates that are current 1 is using the playbook we're using today. So going into premixed and going into perhaps the manufacturing of very difficult to make APIs, give us gross margins much, much different than we current today have in terms of average for the company. So we will double down on that. So Jay's comments in the very beginning about redeploying of R&D in the fourth quarter is actually doubling down in all the programs that we have in bringing new molecules to premix using our capabilities we call the galaxy. Looking into adjacencies and doubling the amount of R&D in by surgery is another sustainable way of being in this business. Creating local initiatives that we are in right now, we have more than probably 70 local initiatives in all countries. Remember, Baxter is 60% outside U.S. sales, and we have put in place a franchises system at a company that completely took away the ability of our local and regional businesses to operate a little bit more independent. And we have great opportunities and we total the significant amount of money in the next 3 to 4 years that will sustain our top line. Revamping our R&D organization to be more focused by business than focusing so it is significant amount of things we're doing, not related directly to price but eventually place a rolling pricing because your mix will be different, the products have higher margin. And we'll change the profile of the company. It's not an easy thing to do, but we're working very hard to do it right. Hence, one of the things that we have rushed doing was acquiring companies. We want to make sure, that we have is disciplined to acquire companies where it matters and be strategically accretive to our business."

But based on what I did in my past and looking at what we're doing today, there is a vast difference in our approach and I totally believe that our people be able to do what we set forth to do and the that we serve are even better. So things are coming together very well. One thing I want to give ready to Baxter and a Baxter management and Baxter employees is once we set our comp to the right direction here, they really execute very quickly. I was surprised how much momentum we've got out of simplification and savings. So the folks of our company have done a phenomenal job embracing these changes and those are not easy changes to make. So in summary, we are happy with the result. And satisfied, by the way. And it just gives us confidence that probably we will overachieve on our long-range plan targets."

And so while there weren't one-timers in place, we do expect to see a what I call downtick, you called 200 to 300 basis points of deterioration in the fourth quarter, which I think, is fair. And like as I said, there is a couple of factors, right? It's probably split roughly evenly between R&D and SG&A. From an R&D standpoint, one of the areas we really want to accelerate and we recognize investments today will yield dividends in a couple of years relates to biosurgery. So we started to accelerate spending there. There are a number of programs that will begin in earnest in the fourth quarter that will facilitate that. And then to Joe's comment earlier, the point of care, another very exciting development for us there's a lot of benefits for the patients. It's great program for us also allows us to run a capital lights model relative to the story way of delivering PD solutions to patients. So very exciting developments for the have cost associated with them. With expect to see that impact our margins by 1 point roughly. And then SG&A it's may be a little bit more than that. For us, Q3 was a low level of SG&A spending. The Q4 number, we're expecting to move back up to roughly the Q2 level pick. We would historically, expect this go get Q4 uptick. Q3 is typically a lower SG&A spend quarter part because of the August month, which is a holiday in many parts of the world. So for us, we're being prudent and thinking about an uptick in spending to occur in the fourth quarter. But then to the last point, we've got to accelerate top line, that is a clear charge of our entire company. And that takes some investments as well. We have empowered our international organization to be in spending on a number of initiatives. There's no impact of the sales letter related to these of note in 2016. But these investments will start to pay dividends and sell fund in '17 and '18. So very exciting development there, good investments to make, we track and monitor these investments in a monthly and quarterly basis. But in combination, the elements of lead to deterioration, slight deterioration from this 16% level. Having said all of that to Joe's point, we shared some projections in May of 2016 from margin in 2018, we said 14% to 15%. In 2020, we said 17% to 18%. We have a higher likelihood of overachieving those numbers as we sit here today. That's clear."

So we look at the India India business we made some decisions related to IVs and PD. In Turkey, we look at our clinics business, along with the ID business there. But on balance, I would say slightly more of an impact -- slightly more of an impact in Renal than it was in the hospital business. To be clear, we've had outstanding performance in the U.S. hospital business, right? The 6% growth has been quite good and internationally, the growth is below that. And so you asked great question, which is how do we accelerate growth outside the U.S? The US has benefited from a number of factors, which are not quite present internationally. We've had the benefit of a new product launch. The SIGMA Spectrum pump. We've had a very solid performance coming from our nutrition business, and we have seen sort of adequate performance coming out of our Surgical Care business. That the real standout performance comes from the U.S. Fluid Systems business. Outside the U.S., we have not had a benefit of a product launch like we had in the U.S. And so for us, how do we address some new products perhaps from a business development standpoint outside the U.S. For example, in the Fluid Systems business, that's a real challenge and opportunity for us as we look to accelerate performance outside the U.S. In addition, our nutrition business, which in the quarter in the United States grow in double digits grew in low single digits outside the U.S. And so for us, another real area of focus has been accelerating the nutrition performance outside the U.S. and that will continue to be an area where we'll invest. Some of the investment initiatives are targeting nutrition growth outside the U.S. So those are a few of the factors. I mean, it's kind the difficult question to answer in the sense that it really is multiproduct, multi geography. But it's safe to say that accelerating performance, Renal outside the U.S. has an outstanding performance, 5% for the quarter, that was a very solid performance for us. Accelerating hospital outside the United States becomes a core area of focus for us in in particular as we move into 2017."

Then I will turn it over to Jay who will take a closer look at the financials and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. After that, we'll open up for Q&A. 
We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We continue to see momentum building across the organization as we implement the strategies outlined at our investor conference to enhance financial performance through reshaping our portfolio, transforming our cost structure and effectively deploying capital. 
As you saw in our press release, Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. These results were driven by continued strong performance of Fluid Systems in U.S. and peritoneal dialysis and acute renal therapies globally. 
Adjusting Baxter's results for the impact of cyclophosphamide and last year's $20 million order of PROTOPAM, sales in the quarter increased 6% globally. 
On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share. This reflects the benefit of solid sales growth, along with our ongoing focus on expense management and operational excellence. 
Now take you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where I will address sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance. 
Global sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 3%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, Hospital Products sales advanced 7% globally, reflecting 13% growth in the U.S. and 1% growth internationally. 
Now to break out Hospital Products at a franchise level. Sales in Fluid Systems totaled $576 million, up 11%. These results reflect continued strength in the U.S., driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions, along with strong growth in access sets resulting from the ongoing successful launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM. Note that this quarter, we anniversary the launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM, which is continuing to drive solid performance and increased market share. 
Next, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, decreasing 4%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, sales increased 6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by U.S. nutrition, which benefited from strong sales of vitamins and amino acids, as well as our recently launched premixed generic injectable, Cefazolin and VANCOMYCIN saline. In addition, this quarter, we launched NUMETA G13E in Europe. This expand our NUMETA pediatric line with the only ready-to-use triple-chamber IV nutrition product for preterm infants. NUMETA utilizes Baxter's proprietary olive oil-based lipid, which has been shown to be immunoneutral, thereby reducing the risk of inflammation for the patient. Baxter is the only manufacturer to utilize olive oil-based lipids as part of our multichambered nutritional product offering. 
Moving to Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products. Third quarter sales totaled $320 million. Global growth in the quarter was flat to the prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in biosurgery, offset by lower sales of anesthesia products. Anesthesia was impacted by the timing of certain governmental austerity measures in Europe and the timing of certain shipments internationally. 
Our industry-leading inhaled anesthetics portfolio continues to represent a solid platform for future growth and global expansion. 
Finally, in Hospital Products. BioPharma Solutions, our contract manufacturing business, generated sales of $122 million, an increase of 15%. This growth reflects the benefit of an easier comp for the prior year, along with increased customer demand for products produced in our cytotoxic manufacturing facility in Germany. 
Turning next to our Renal business. Renal sales were $977 million globally, up 6%. This reflects ongoing momentum in peritoneal dialysis or PD, which delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth internationally. PD growth is being driven by an expanding patient base, favorable pricing in U.S. and the ongoing launches of our new APD cycler, AMIA in the U.S. and HOMECHOICE CLARIA outside the U.S. These systems feature our innovative SHARESOURCE technology, which was also recently approved in Japan. SHARESOURCE will be a defining feature for our new Kaguya APD cycler in Japan, which we expect to gain local market approval shortly. 
Additionally, Q3 results reflect the positive impact of our acute renal business, which delivered double-digit growth globally. This reflects growing global demand for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT, which we're well positioned to address with our market-leading Prismaflex platform. Acute care is a fast-growing market where we have a substantial opportunity to serve patients and clinicians with high-value products. So this will remain a growing area of emphasis as we look ahead. 
Growth in Renal was somewhat offset by performance in in-center hemodialysis. We're taking a deliberate approach to improving profitability in our HD business. As you may have seen in our press release yesterday, we launched our novel and proprietary HDx therapy, enabled by our differentiated Theranova dialyzer. 
HDx therapy with Theranova has the potential to improve outcomes and raise the standard of treatment for end-stage renal disease patients. It has just launched in France, Australia and New Zealand and will launch in several other Western European markets before the end of the year. 
That's a brief snapshot of our Q3 results. I would like to close my comments by putting our quarterly performance in a broader, strategic context. At our investor conference in May, we identified 3 critical drivers that would elevate our performance to top quartile levels: portfolio innovation management; operational excellent -- excellence rather, excellence; capital allocation. The results we have seen year-to-date reflect the progress we have made across these 3 levers. 
In portfolio and innovation management, we have selectively exited products from certain global markets when our presence and potential are no longer in line with our go-forward strategy, while ensuring these markets continue to have alternate care options available for the patients. 
We have also continued our candid assessment of legacy R&D, discontinuing several programs either in noncore areas or where our prospects did not merit projected resources and demands. Choices like these are enabling us to refocus our investment on high-potential, high-value R&D and on a more strategic sales and marketing opportunities in biosurgery, PD and nutrition, premixed injectables and more. 
The third quarter results to a pivotal quarter in our cost transformation efforts. In recent months, we have executed plans to rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure or sale of a number of facilities in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. These actions will streamline and simplify our operations and better position us to manage costs while continuing to address patient and customer needs across the globe. 
And earlier this month, we began a wave of organizational restructuring in our global commercial operations and certain other functions, which was the outcome of a rigorous zero-based organizational assessment. These streamlining is expected to generate a higher-performing organization, along with cost savings that we contemplated in our May investor conference. 
Efforts like this support a leaner cost base and, again, the opportunity to channel investment in new ways. Innovation is our -- is, of course, the most crucial ingredient in our ongoing success. And you will continue to see capital allocation choices that reinvest in the business to bolster R&D as well as ongoing sustainable top line growth and margin expansion. And as you have heard me say repeatedly, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities in our core growth areas and high-potential adjacencies. Any likely news in this front should be interpreted as a sign of our discipline in assessing deals with strategic fit and financial merit. 
So in sum, our success this quarter represents significant progress on our strategic journey. And while we are pleased, we're not satisfied. We will continue to make progress on our journey to transform Baxter into a top-quartile company. 
And with that, I will turn over to Jay who will walk you through the financials. Then we'll open it up for your questions."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter. And on a reporte",1249,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter. And on a reported basis, sales grew 3%. Growth came in at the high end of our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in PD and nutrition therapies. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 44.9% represents an improvement of more than 100 basis points over the prior year, driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and favorable manufacturing performance in the quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $611 million and decreased 9% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the benefit from lower pension expense. 
TSA income totaled approximately $25 million in the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as need for these services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. 
During the third quarter, we did report a charge of approximately $130 million for restructuring activities, of which approximately $100 million was related to employee termination costs, which are expected to generate over $100 million of annual savings once fully implemented. As Joe mentioned, these actions were initiated earlier this month and were contemplated in the long-term financial guidance we provided in May. We will continue to optimize our cost structure as we move forward. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. While we did benefit in the quarter from the discontinuation of selected programs, we expect to begin redeploying that spend in areas like biosurgery and premixed injectables beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by positive product mix, lower R&D spend and the benefit of our initiatives to control spending and reduce expenses. This represents a 480 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense was $14 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and executed a $1.6 billion 3-tranche debt offering consisting of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes. Proceeds from this offering were used to retire a series of existing bonds maturing in the near to intermediate term as well as pay off all of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the transaction, Baxter's bond maturity profile increased from an average of 9 years to 15 years, and our average coupon rate declined by nearly 1%. 
Adjusted other income totaled $4 million in the quarter, primarily resulting from a foreign exchange gain on a balance sheet position. The adjusted tax rate was 22% for the quarter, slightly higher than expectations, driven by earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.43 to $0.45 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.11 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to a higher share count and tax rate. 
Along with our equity-for-equity exchange, which we executed in the latter part of the second quarter, during the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $40 million or approximately 1 million shares during the quarter. These repurchases were more than offset by higher-than-expected option-related dilution given Baxter's stock performance during the quarter. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales. On a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%. 
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 2%. We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 3% to 4% or approximately 5%, excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of low double digits for Fluid Systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline versus the prior year, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclo and now expect full year sales of $210 million with the assumption that no additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales were expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS or 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of both cyclo and PROTOPAM. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow approximately 1%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to increase low single digits. 
For the Renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 4% to 5%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 13%, a 100 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance and a 200 basis point improvement relative to our original guidance. This increase is driven by improved sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses. 
We expect interest expense to total approximately $70 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $55 million, which does not reflect -- which does reflect a benefit of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to the disposition of an equity investment. 
For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 21%, driven by the expected mix of earnings. For full year 2016, we anticipate an average share count of 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.88 to $1.91 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share. 
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion and CapEx of approximately $800 million, resulting in approximately $650 million in free cash flow. This represents an increase of 30% from our original guidance of $500 million. 
We're applying the same discipline to managing capital expenditures as we are to our expense base, which has resulted in a benefit of approximately $100 million in lower CapEx for the year. In addition, we have kicked -- we have initiated programs focused on improving our days payable and days receivable ratios, which will benefit operating cash flow going forward. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The growth does represent a deceleration from previous quarters given our previously announced decision to exit select markets outside the U.S. The collective impact of these exits impacted top line by approximately 1 percentage point. In addition, lower cyclo sales compared to the prior year also negatively impacted top line by approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter. Adjusting for these 2 factors, growth in the quarter would be approximately 4%, which is in line with our long-term projections. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share. This guidance reflects increased investments in R&D and incremental investments in SG&A. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

So as far as the fourth quarter goes, overall, we were obviously very pleased with the margin performance in the third quarter. So 16% represents the highest quarterly margin target that we've achieved since the spinoff. As we move to Q4, we do expect a slight downtick in the operating margin of the business, and really, there's a couple of drivers of that. One is we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments in both biosurgery and premixed injectables, as I mentioned. And so that will be one factor that increases the R&D spending relative to our current level. And then the second item relates to SG&A. We do expect a slight uptick as well in SG&A in the fourth quarter as a percent of sales. There's a couple of factors going on there. One is we do have historic seasonality. So if you look at Baxter over the last many years, we have -- we normally have an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We do expect that to repeat. And then the second factor that's going on with respect to SG&A is one of the topics we discussed in our May investor conference relates to what we call local initiatives, the idea that given the diverse geographic portfolio that we have in place and the product portfolio, we really have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by unlocking some of the entrepreneurial spirit outside the U.S. But frankly, that comes with it an SG&A cost. And so over the course of the last quarter, we have approved a number of investment initiatives, which we will -- we believe will benefit 2017 and '18 but do have a slight cost associated with them. So for these reasons, we do expect a slight downtick as it relates to the overall margin but, again, feel very confident in the operational performance. The -- as we look to 2017, I think it's too early to get into forecast for 2017. What I can tell you is in our May investor conference, we shared a series of projections for 2018 and 2020. And it is clear, the data points that we have point to accelerated performance relative to those expectations. So we have a higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers and exceed those numbers today than we did when we shared them in May of 2016."

We're -- one of the numbers that I think the team is most proud of is the cash -- the free cash flow performance. As I mentioned in the script, we're increasing it from $500 million to $650 million, and really, there's a couple of different components to that. One is operating cash flow, we're raising approximately $50 million. And this is an area where I believe there will be more substantial benefits from some of the programs that we've initiated this year in future years. So we're spending a lot of time as a team on working capital. Days payable, days sales outstanding and the inventory, how can we drive that down? And those are balances that you don't switch on overnight. But over time, with rigor and focus, you can drive real result in these categories. So we don't really have much benefit this year. But 2017, '18, '19, you'll expect to see some meaningful working capital improvements. Where we were able to drive an impact this year, and frankly, I believe this will be sustainable, is in CapEx. We did a couple of things this year which I think provided a very real benefit. First, we did a zero-based budget for CapEx, which we review quarterly with our senior leadership team. So our top executives at the company sit down on a quarterly basis, and the result of that is twofold. One, we did cancel a number of low value-adding programs, but second, for every single program that we had, the challenge to the team was, how can we do this more cost-effectively? And the results were very, very impressive. So the second piece relates to an incentive change that we put in place at the beginning of the year. For our top employees, we have a short-term incentive plan for the top several thousand employees. And last year, there was no cash flow component to this. This year, recognizing the challenge that we faced, with CapEx being 9% of sales, we installed a free cash flow trigger for our short-term incentive plan. By focusing on free cash flow now, we have our entire organization geared and charging towards driving improvements in this important metric. So while that's harder to quantify, I believe that that's paid a real dividend in our numbers and creativity as we think about addressing CapEx spending. But frankly, this is one area where I believe we have achieved a new normal and will continue to drive performance from here."

And I would say it was -- contributing to it were gross margin, SG&A leverage and some R&D leverage. From a gross margin standpoint, let's start with that. There were a number of factors in play. We've talked a lot about this concept of portfolio management and business mix and upgrading the business mix. And as we look at the Q3 results from Baxter, you start to see that story playing out. So for example, we saw a very strong performance in our U.S. hospital business in the sets area and access. Our sets in the United States grew approximately 20%. That simple business mix factor contributed to our margin. And as we increase the installed base in the United States of SIGMA SPECTRUM, we'll continue to benefit from this mix factor as it moves forward. From an international standpoint, you'll see that we have lower Fluid Systems sales. But in areas like Renal in particular, where we had double-digit acute growth, and PD growth, where we've been very focused on accelerating growth, those are 2 good-margin areas that provide an uplift from a business mix standpoint. And finally, from a business mix standpoint, you heard Joe comment earlier in this call about how we're going to manage in-center HD for profitability, very focused on driving this. So while that business had lower sales, it had a business mix and, from our standpoint, focus on profitability. Those are the 3 examples from a gross margin standpoint where business mix played an impact. The second comment related to gross margin is manufacturing and performance. Overall, we had solid manufacturing performance. We had good volumes in Q2 and Q3. The result of that is a P&L benefit from a manufacturing standpoint. We'll expect to continue driving manufacturing performance going forward. This is a real area of focus for us, how can we utilize our facilities? In Joe's prepared remarks, you heard him reference, we've closed or sold a number of facilities over the course of this year. That leads to better leveraging of the network. The final piece related to gross margin is this idea of, how can we think creatively about our business arrangements, either through pricing or being thoughtful about the services that we provide? A simple example of this is we're really focused in our U.S. Renal business on limiting the amount of overnight shipping that occurs. For us, that has historically been a real cost that we've borne, and it's impacted our margin. By focusing on that, we're able to drive a better margin. So those are the 3 drivers that have impacted our gross margin. Moving to R&D. We made a couple of tough decisions over the course of this year with respect to project -- a project like VIVIA. And so as a result of that, we saw lower R&D spending in the quarter. Now to my earlier comment, I do expect an uptick in this as we start to reinvest in some exciting new areas for us that have nearer-term paybacks than the VIVIA project. But in the quarter, this idea of rigorous capital allocation did play out in the R&D spend. And then finally, from the SG&A standpoint, I would make a couple of comments here. First, this idea of zero-based spending, challenging every single dollar that we have in place, that's something that the company has adopted from a process standpoint. So as we went through our budgeting process this year, we had a very rigorous zero-based spending approach, a zero-based organization approach in place, applying these techniques to our cost structure. But I think beyond that, culturally, the entire organization is incredibly aware of spending and driving results. The number of ideas that we're generating from our organization at large with respect to simplification, with respect to savings ideas is remarkable. And that simple phenomena has played out in our SG&A numbers for the quarter."

So overall, there's essentially 2 drivers of the deceleration in the fourth quarter. One is cyclo. While we don't -- we're not anticipating an incremental competitor in cyclophosphamide, we do expect lower levels than prior years, down about $20 mill",223,"Yes. So overall, there's essentially 2 drivers of the deceleration in the fourth quarter. One is cyclo. While we don't -- we're not anticipating an incremental competitor in cyclophosphamide, we do expect lower levels than prior years, down about $20 million or roughly 1 point of growth to $45 million in the quarter. So that's a deceleration that we've expected and kind of consistent with how we thought about things. As we look at the other area that has impacted our Q4 results, we have always talked about this idea of rigorously going through our portfolio and ensuring that every single sale that we make is one that contributes positively to the economics of Baxter. And so to -- in support of that, we did walk away from roughly $130 million in sales on an annual basis, which amounts to roughly 1 point of growth impact in the quarter. Now the good news is this has limited to no impact on the bottom line. The sales were essentially break-even, and we've been able to eliminate all the costs associated with those sales. So while, on the bottom line, there's no impact, it does impact the top line a bit. If I were to adjust for these 2 factors, the 2% growth would be more like our normal expected run rate growth of 4%."

First thing we did was completely reallocate capital. If I show today to you the dollars invested by franchise in the company versus 12 months ago, you see a significant difference. We are doubling down in areas like biosurgery. It's going to take us a couple of years to pick up momentum there because we fell behind in a lot of different things, but we are looking at some M&A augmentation for the short term. We also are doubling down in the PD business. In peritoneal dialysis business, I have great confidence that we're going to unveil a very different model of doing business in some parts of the world. We are working with payers at this moment, and I think that would be a very interesting way of expanding the use of PD, which has proven to be, economically and from the access point of view, a better way forward for the patient and for the system. And with SHARESOURCE, we're going to continue to invest there. I see us very focused on the M&A area associated with organic growth in our generic injectable business. We think we have a platform opportunity at the moment, plus our internal growth engines in terms of new molecules, which we're accelerating. so all of this gives me the confidence that we can achieve 4% to 5% in a couple of years. I tell you, we are trimming our portfolio where we're moving a significant amount of unprofitable dollars, which will boost our 2017 bottom line, but cleaning up the portfolio and simplifying Baxter is also part of the playbook. So the playbook is innovation, really good capital allocation practices, use of capital dollars in a way that was different in the past. As you can see, our free cash flow numbers will allow us to generate more profitability for the company. And lastly, when we talk about transformation, it's not just cost reduction and reduction of personnel, but it's also the complete restructuring of the company in terms of its processes. Baxter grew up to be a very complicated company with a lot of SKUs, and we're working very hard to the office of the business transformation to redo that. So that accumulation of factors give us pretty good odds of hitting the numbers. We just need to continue forth with a lot of tenacity to achieve what we set forth to do."

Do we have price increases? We do have price increases like many companies. But the sustainability, what I see in the long term, is neutral to slight positive on pricing. So I want to make that very clear. The other thing is, how do you sustain that top line with transforming the gross margin contribution and participating in markets that have higher growth rates than our current one is, is using the playbook we're using today. So going into premixed and going into perhaps the manufacturing of very difficult-to-make APIs give us gross margins much, much different than we current today have in terms of average for the company. So we will double down on that. So Jay's comments in the very beginning about redeploying of R&D in the fourth quarter is actually doubling down in all the programs that we have in bringing new molecules to premix using our capability of -- we call the GALAXY. Looking into adjacencies and doubling the amount of R&D in biosurgery is another sustainable way of being in this business. Creating local initiatives, that we are, and right now, we have more than probably 70 local initiatives in all countries. Remember, Baxter is 60% outside U.S. sales, and we had put in place a franchise system at the company that completely took away the ability of our local and regional businesses to operate a little bit more independent. And we have great opportunities and will total the significant amount of money in the next 3 to 4 years that will sustain our top line, revamping our R&D organization to be more focused by business than focus in overall commerce. So there's a significant amount of things we're doing. They are not related directly to price but eventually place a rolling pricing because your mix will be different, the products have higher margin, and we'll change the profile of the company. It's not an easy thing to do, but we're working very hard to do it right. Hence, one of the things that we haven't rushed into doing was acquiring companies. We want to make sure that we have the discipline to acquire the companies where it matters and be strategically accretive to our business."

But based on what I did in my past and looking at what we're doing today, there is a vast difference in our approach, and I truly believe that our people will be able to do what we set forth to do at the savings that we set or even better. So things are coming together very well. One thing I want to give credit to Baxter and the Baxter management and Baxter employees is once we set our compass to the right direction here, they really execute very quickly. I was surprised how much momentum we've got out of simplification and savings. So the folks of our company have done a phenomenal job embracing these changes, and those are not easy changes to make. So in summary, we are happy with the result and satisfied, by the way, and it gives us confidence that probably we will overachieve on our long-range plan targets."

And so while there weren't onetimers in place, we do expect to see a -- what I call downtick. You called 200 to 300 basis points of deterioration in the fourth quarter, which I think is fair. There's -- and I -- as I said, there's a couple of factors, right? It's probably split roughly evenly between R&D and SG&A. From an R&D standpoint, one of the areas we really want to accelerate and we recognize investments today will yield dividends in a couple of years relates to biosurgery. So we started to accelerate spending there. There are a number of programs that will begin in earnest in the fourth quarter that will facilitate that. And then to Joe's comment earlier, this point of care, another very exciting development for us. It's got a lot of benefits for the patients. It's a great program for us. It also allows us to run a capital-light model relative to the historic way of delivering PD solutions to patients. So very exciting developments, but they have a cost associated with them. We do expect to see that impact our margin by 1 point roughly. And then SG&A, it's maybe a little bit more than that. For us, Q3 was a low level of SG&A spending. The Q4 number, we're expecting to move back up to roughly the Q2 level. We would historically expect to see a Q4 uptick. Q3 is typically a lower SG&A spend quarter in part because of the August month, which is a holiday in many parts of the world. So for us, we're being prudent and thinking about an uptick in spending to occur in the fourth quarter. But then to the last point, we've got to accelerate the top line. That is a clear charge of our entire company, and that takes some investments as well. We have empowered our international organization to begin spending on a number of initiatives. There's no impact on the sales line related to these of note in 2016, but these investments will start to pay dividends and self-fund in '17 and '18. So very exciting development there, good investments to make. We track and monitor these investments on a monthly and quarterly basis. But in combination, these elements lead to a deterioration -- slight deterioration from this 16% level. Having said all of that, to Joe's point, we shared some projections in May of 2016. For margin in 2018, we said 14% to 15%. In 2020, we said 17% to 18%. We have a higher likelihood of overachieving those numbers as we sit here today. That's clear."

Look, the overall hospital business, as far as the exits that took place, it actually was slightly tilted towards Renal. So we looked at the India business. We made some decisions related to IVs in PD. In Turkey, we looked at our clinics business along with the IV business there. But on balance, I would say slightly more of an impact in the -- slightly more of an impact in Renal than it was in the hospital business. To be clear, we've had outstanding performance in the U.S. hospital business, right? The 6% growth has been quite good, and internationally, the growth is below that. And so you asked a great question, which is, how do we accelerate growth outside the U.S.? The U.S. has benefited from a number of factors which are not quite present internationally. We've had the benefit of a new product launch, the SIGMA SPECTRUM pump. We've had very solid performance coming from our new Nutrition business, and we've seen sort of adequate performance coming out of our Surgical Care business. But the real standout performance comes from the U.S. Fluid Systems business. Outside the U.S., we have not had the benefit of a product launch like we've had in the U.S. And so for us, how do we address some new products perhaps from a business development standpoint outside the U.S.? For example, in the Fluid Systems business, that's a real challenge and opportunity for us as we look to accelerate performance outside the U.S. In addition, our Nutrition business, which in the quarter in the United States grew in double digits, grew in low single digits outside the U.S. And so for us, another real area of focus has been accelerating the nutrition performance outside the U.S., and that will continue to be an area where we'll invest. Some of the investment initiatives are targeting nutrition growth outside the U.S. So those are a few of the factors. I mean, it's kind of a difficult question to answer in the sense that it really is multiproduct, multi-geography. But it's safe to say that accelerating performance -- Renal outside the U.S. has seen outstanding performance. 5% for the quarter, that was a very solid performance for us. Accelerating the hospital outside the United States becomes a core area of focus for us in, in particular as we move to 2017."

We are extremely disciplined when it comes to how we look at our shareholders' money. And the ability to drive value is fundamentally important to us. So at the moment, we are looking at 3 specific targets that we think have good value for the company. The competition sometimes is irrational about how people are paying for some of the targets, and we don't go there. We don't want to be part of that group. We want to make sure that everything that we pay for has a way of paying back to the company and to the shareholders. So we are very diligent. I meet with the team every month.

We're doing business in locations that we should not be doing business. We've been there for a long time, but it has not panned out to be a good business. And the worst thing that we can have is to keep a business afloat that is -- on the marginal contribution is eroding value to the company. So we will take the measures that we want to take and make sure that anything that we do, we will have the intentions of making the company stronger in the future. So for us, to deliver our bottom line, we will have to take some of these business out of -- no, off-line, and I have no problems with that. At the same time, we are very focused in investing in the right R&D programs to be able to create the momentum to bring the top line to the 3% to 4%, eventually 4% to 5%. So there's -- this is -- our job #1 right now is to work on top line growth. But we will revamp and repurpose our portfolio so we are not here sitting 3, 4 years from today with massive unwanted businesses that we should have taken action before."

I will begin this morning by sharing some comments on our performance and progress. Then I will turn it over to Jay who will take a closer look at the financials and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. After that, we'll open up for Q&A. 
We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We continue to see momentum building across the organization as we implement the strategies outlined at our investor conference to enhance financial performance through reshaping our portfolio, transforming our cost structure and effectively deploying capital. 
As you saw in our press release, Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. These results were driven by continued strong performance of Fluid Systems in U.S. and peritoneal dialysis and acute renal therapies globally. 
Adjusting Baxter's results for the impact of cyclophosphamide and last year's $20 million order of PROTOPAM, sales in the quarter increased 6% globally. 
On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share. This reflects the benefit of solid sales growth, along with our ongoing focus on expense management and operational excellence. 
Now take you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where I will address sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance. 
Global sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 3%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, Hospital Products sales advanced 7% globally, reflecting 13% growth in the U.S. and 1% growth internationally. 
Now to break out Hospital Products at a franchise level. Sales in Fluid Systems totaled $576 million, up 11%. These results reflect continued strength in the U.S., driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions, along with the strong growth in Access sets resulting from the ongoing successful launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM. Note that this quarter, we anniversary the launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM, which is continuing to drive solid performance and increased market share. 
Next, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, decreasing 4%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, sales increased 6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by U.S. nutrition, which benefited from strong sales of vitamins and amino acids, as well as our recently launched premixed generic injectable, Cefazolin and VANCOMYCIN saline. In addition, this quarter, we launched NUMETA G13E in Europe. These expand our NUMETA pediatric line with the only ready-to-use triple-chamber IV nutrition product for preterm infants. NUMETA utilizes Baxter's proprietary olive oil-based lipid, which has been shown to be immunoneutral, thereby reducing the risk of inflammation for the patient. Baxter is the only manufacturer to utilize olive oil-based lipids as part of our multichambered nutritional product offering. 
Moving to Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products. Third quarter sales totaled $320 million. Global growth in the quarter was flat to the prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in biosurgery, offset by lower sales of anesthesia products. Anesthesia was impacted by the timing of certain government austerity measures in Europe and the timing of certain shipments internationally. 
Our industry-leading inhaled anesthetics portfolio continues to represent a solid platform for future growth and global expansion. 
Finally, in Hospital Products. BioPharma Solutions, our contract manufacturing business, generated sales of $122 million, an increase of 15%. This growth reflects the benefit of an easier comp for the prior year, along with increased customer demand for products produced in our cytotoxic manufacturing facility in Germany. 
Turning next to our Renal business. Renal sales were $977 million globally, up 6%. This reflects ongoing momentum in peritoneal dialysis or PD, which delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth internationally. PD growth is being driven by an expanding patient base, favorable pricing in U.S. and the ongoing launches of our new APD cycler, AMIA in the U.S. and HOMECHOICE CLARIA outside the U.S. These systems feature our innovative SHARESOURCE technology, which was also recently approved in Japan. SHARESOURCE will be a defining feature for our new Kaguya APD cycler in Japan, which we expect to gain local market approval shortly. 
Additionally, Q3 results reflect the positive impact of our acute renal business, which delivered double-digit growth globally. This reflects growing global demand for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT, which we're well positioned to address with our market-leading Prismaflex platform. Acute care is a fast-growing market where we have a substantial opportunity to serve patients and clinicians with high-value products. So this will remain a growing area of emphasis as we look ahead. 
Growth in Renal was somewhat offset by performance in in-center hemodialysis. We're taking a deliberate approach to improving profitability in our HD business. As you may have seen in our press release yesterday, we launched our novel and proprietary HDx therapy, enabled by our differentiated Theranova dialyzer. 
HDx therapy with Theranova has the potential to improve outcomes and raise the standard of treatment for end-stage renal disease patients. It has just launched in France, Australia and New Zealand and will launch in several other Western European markets before the end of the year. 
That's a brief snapshot of our Q3 results. I would like to close my comments by putting our quarterly performance in a broader, strategic context. At our investor conference in May, we identified 3 critical drivers that would elevate our performance to top quartile levels: portfolio innovation management; operational excellent -- excellence rather, excellence; capital allocation. The results we have seen year-to-date reflect the progress we have made across these 3 levers. 
In portfolio and innovation management, we have selectively exited products from certain global markets when our presence and potential were no longer in line with our go-forward strategy, while ensuring these markets continue to have alternate care options available for the patients. 
We have also continued our candid assessment of legacy R&D, discontinuing several programs either in noncore areas or where our prospects did not merit projected resources and demands. Choices like these are enabling us to refocus our investment on high-potential, high-value R&D and on a more strategic sales and marketing opportunities in biosurgery, PD and nutrition, premixed injectables and more. 
The third quarter results to a pivotal quarter in our cost transformation efforts. In recent months, we have executed plans to rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure or sale of a number of facilities in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. These actions will streamline and simplify our operations and better position us to manage costs while continuing to address patient and customer needs across the globe. 
And earlier this month, we began a wave of organizational restructuring in our global commercial operations and certain other functions, which was the outcome of a rigorous zero-based organizational assessment. This streamlining is expected to generate a higher-performing organization, along with cost savings that we contemplated in our May investor conference. 
Efforts like this support a leaner cost base and, again, the opportunity to channel investment in new ways. Innovation is our -- is, of course, the most crucial ingredient in our ongoing success. And you will continue to see capital allocation choices that reinvest in the business to bolster R&D as well as ongoing sustainable top line growth and margin expansion. And as you have heard me say repeatedly, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities in our core growth areas and high-potential adjacencies. Any likely news on this front should be interpreted as a sign of our discipline in assessing deals with strategic fit and financial merit. 
So in sum, our success this quarter represents significant progress on our strategic journey. And while we are pleased, we're not satisfied. We will continue to make progress on our journey to transform Baxter into a top-quartile company. 
And with that, I will turn over to Jay who will walk you through the financials. Then we'll open it up for your questions."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter. And on a reporte",1251,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter. And on a reported basis, sales grew 3%. Growth came in at the high end of our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in PD and nutrition therapies. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 44.9% represents an improvement of more than 100 basis points over the prior year, driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and favorable manufacturing performance in the quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $611 million and decreased 9% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the benefit from lower pension expense. 
TSA income totaled approximately $25 million in the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as need for these services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. 
During the third quarter, we did report a charge of approximately $130 million for restructuring activities, of which approximately $100 million was related to employee termination costs, which are expected to generate over $100 million of annual savings once fully implemented. As Joe mentioned, these actions were initiated earlier this month and were contemplated in the long-term financial guidance we provided in May. We will continue to optimize our cost structure as we move forward. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. While we did benefit in the quarter from the discontinuation of selected programs, we expect to begin redeploying that spend in areas like biosurgery and premixed injectables beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by positive project -- product mix, lower R&D spend and the benefit of our initiatives to control spending and reduce expenses. This represents a 480 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense was $14 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and executed a $1.6 billion 3-tranche debt offering consisting of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes. Proceeds from this offering were used to retire a series of existing bonds maturing in the near to intermediate term as well as pay off all of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the transaction, Baxter's bond maturity profile increased from an average of 9 years to 15 years, and our average coupon rate declined by nearly 1%. 
Adjusted other income totaled $4 million in the quarter, primarily resulting from a foreign exchange gain on a balance sheet position. The adjusted tax rate was 22% for the quarter, slightly higher than expectations, driven by earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.43 to $0.45 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.11 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to a higher share count and tax rate. 
Along with our equity-for-equity exchange, which we executed in the latter part of the second quarter, during the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $40 million or approximately 1 million shares during the quarter. These repurchases were more than offset by higher-than-expected option-related dilution given Baxter's stock performance during the quarter. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales. On a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%. 
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 2%. We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 3% to 4% or approximately 5%, excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of low double digits for Fluid Systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline versus the prior year, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclo and now expect full year sales of $210 million with the assumption that no additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS or 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of both cyclo and PROTOPAM. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow approximately 1%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to increase low single digits. 
For the Renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 4% to 5%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 13%, a 100 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance and a 200 basis point improvement relative to our original guidance. This increase is driven by improved sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses. 
We expect interest expense to total approximately $70 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $55 million, which does not reflect -- which does reflect a benefit of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to the disposition of an equity investment. 
For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 21%, driven by the expected mix of earnings. For full year 2016, we anticipate an average share count of 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.88 to $1.91 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share. 
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion and CapEx of approximately $800 million, resulting in approximately $650 million in free cash flow. This represents an increase of 30% from our original guidance of $500 million. 
We're applying the same discipline to managing capital expenditures as we are to our expense base, which has resulted in a benefit of approximately $100 million in lower CapEx for the year. In addition, we have kicked -- we have initiated programs focused on improving our days payable and days receivable ratios, which will benefit operating cash flow going forward. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The growth does represent a deceleration from previous quarters given our previously announced decision to exit select markets outside the U.S. The collective impact of these exits impact top line by approximately 1 percentage point. In addition, lower cyclo sales compared to the prior year also negatively impact top line by approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter. Adjusting for these 2 factors, growth in the quarter would be approximately 4%, which is in line with our long-term projections. 
And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share. This guidance reflects increased investments in R&D and incremental investments in SG&A. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

So as far as the fourth quarter goes, overall, we were obviously very pleased with the margin performance in the third quarter. So 16% represents the highest quarterly margin target that we've achieved since the spinoff. As we move to Q4, we do expect a slight downtick in the operating margin of the business, and really, there's a couple of drivers of that. One is we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments in both biosurgery and premixed injectables, as I mentioned. And so that will be one factor that increases the R&D spending relative to our current level. And then the second item relates to SG&A. We do expect a slight uptick as well in SG&A in the fourth quarter as a percent of sales. There's a couple of factors going on there. One is we do have historic seasonality. So if you look at Baxter over the last many years, we have -- we normally have an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We do expect that to repeat. And then the second factor that's going on with respect to SG&A is one of the topics we discussed in our May investor conference relates to what we call local initiatives, the idea that given the diverse geographic portfolio that we have in place and the product portfolio, we really have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by unlocking some of the entrepreneurial spirit outside the U.S. But frankly, that comes with it an SG&A cost. And so over the course of the last quarter, we have approved a number of investment initiatives, which we will -- we believe will benefit 2017 and '18 but do have a slight cost associated with them. So for these reasons, we do expect a slight downtick as it relates to the overall margin but, again, feel very confident in the operational performance. The -- as we look to 2017, I think it's too early to get into forecast for 2017. What I can tell you is in our May investor conference, we shared a series of projections for 2018 and 2020. And it is clear, the data points that we have point to accelerated performance relative to those expectations. So we have a higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers and exceed those numbers today than we did when we shared them in May of 2016."

We're -- one of the numbers that I think the team is most proud of is the cash -- the free cash flow performance. As I mentioned in the script, we're increasing it from $500 million to $650 million, and really, there's a couple of different components to that. One is operating cash flow, we're raising approximately $50 million. And this is an area where I believe there will be more substantial benefits from some of the programs that we've initiated this year in future years. So we're spending a lot of time as a team on working capital. Days payable, days sales outstanding and the inventory, how can we drive that down? And those are balances that you don't switch on overnight. But over time, with rigor and focus, you can drive real result in these categories. So we don't really have much benefit this year. But 2017, '18, '19, you'll expect to see some meaningful working capital improvements. Where we were able to drive an impact this year, and frankly, I believe this will be sustainable, is in CapEx. We did a couple of things this year which I think provided a very real benefit. First, we did a zero-based budget for CapEx, which we review quarterly with our senior leadership team. So our top executives at the company sit down on a quarterly basis, and the result of that is twofold: One, we did cancel a number of low value-adding programs, but second, for every single program that we had, the challenge to the team was, how can we do this more cost-effectively? And the results were very, very impressive. So the second piece relates to an incentive change that we put in place at the beginning of the year. For our top employees, we have a short-term incentive plan for the top several thousand employees. And last year, there was no cash flow component to this. This year, recognizing the challenge that we faced, with CapEx being 9% of sales, we installed a free cash flow trigger for our short-term incentive plan. By focusing on free cash flow now, we have our entire organization geared and charging towards driving improvements in this important metric. So while that's harder to quantify, I believe that that's paid a real dividend in our numbers and creativity as we think about addressing CapEx spending. But frankly, this is one area where I believe we have achieved a new normal and will continue to drive performance from here."

And I would say it was -- contributing to it were gross margin, SG&A leverage and some R&D leverage. From a gross margin standpoint, let's start with that. There were a number of factors in play. We've talked a lot about this concept of portfolio management and business mix and upgrading the business mix. And as we look at the Q3 results from Baxter, you start to see that story playing out. So for example, we saw a very strong performance in our U.S. hospital business in the sets area and Access. Our sets in the United States grew approximately 20%. That simple business mix factor contributed to our margin. And as we increase the installed base in the United States of SIGMA SPECTRUM, we'll continue to benefit from this mix factor as it moves forward. From an international standpoint, you'll see that we have lower Fluid Systems sales. But in areas like Renal in particular, where we had double-digit acute growth, and PD growth, where we've been very focused on accelerating growth, those are 2 good-margin areas that provide an uplift from a business mix standpoint. And finally, from a business mix standpoint, you heard Joe comment earlier in this call about how we're going to manage in-center HD for profitability, very focused on driving this. So while that business had lower sales, it had a business mix and, from our standpoint, focus on profitability. Those are the 3 examples from a gross margin standpoint where business mix played an impact. The second comment related to gross margin is manufacturing and performance. Overall, we had solid manufacturing performance. We had good volumes in Q2 and Q3. The result of that is a P&L benefit from a manufacturing standpoint. We'll expect to continue driving manufacturing performance going forward. This is a real area of focus for us. How can we effectively utilize our facilities? In Joe's prepared remarks, you heard him reference, we've closed or sold a number of facilities over the course of this year. That leads to better leveraging of the network. The final piece related to gross margin is this idea of, how can we think creatively about our business arrangements, either through pricing or being thoughtful about the services that we provide? A simple example of this is we're really focused in our U.S. Renal business on limiting the amount of overnight shipping that occurs. For us, that has historically been a real cost that we've borne, and it's impacted our margin. By focusing on that, we're able to drive a better margin. So those are the 3 drivers that have impacted our gross margin. Moving to R&D. We made a couple of tough decisions over the course of this year with respect to project -- a project like VIVIA. And so as a result of that, we saw lower R&D spending in the quarter. Now to my earlier comment, I do expect an uptick in this as we start to reinvest in some exciting new areas for us that have nearer-term paybacks than the VIVIA project. But in the quarter, this idea of rigorous capital allocation did play out in the R&D spend. And then finally, from the SG&A standpoint, I would make a couple of comments here. First, this idea of zero-based spending, challenging every single dollar that we have in place, that's something that the company has adopted from a process standpoint. So as we went through our budgeting process this year, we had a very rigorous zero-based spending approach, a zero-based organization approach in place, applying these techniques to our cost structure. But I think beyond that, culturally, the entire organization is incredibly aware of spending and driving results. The number of ideas that we're generating from our organization at large with respect to simplification, with respect to savings ideas is remarkable. And that simple phenomena has played out in our SG&A numbers for the quarter."

So overall, there's essentially 2 drivers of the deceleration in the fourth quarter. One is cyclo. While we don't -- we're not anticipating an incremental competitor in cyclophosphamide, we do expect lower levels than prior years, down about $20 million or roughly 1 point of growth to $45 million in the quarter. So that's a deceleration that we've expected and kind of consistent with how we thought about things. As we look at the other area that has impacted our Q4 results, we have always talked about this idea of rigorously going through our portfolio and ensuring that every single sale that we make is one that contributes positively to the economics of Baxter. And so to -- in support of that, we did walk away from roughly $130 million in sales on an annual basis, which amounts to roughly 1 point of growth impact in the quarter. Now the good news is this has limited to no impact on the bottom line. The sales were essentially break-even, and we've been able to eliminate all the costs associated with those sales. So while, on the bottom line, there's no impact, it does impact the top line a bit. If I were to adjust for these 2 factors, the 2% growth would be more like our normal expected run rate growth of 4%."

First thing we did was completely reallocate capital. If I show today to you the dollars invested by franchise in the company versus 12 months ago, you see a significant difference. We are doubling down in areas like biosurgery. It's going to take us a couple of years to pick up momentum there because we fell behind in a lot of different things, but we are looking at some M&A augmentation for the short term. We also are doubling down in the PD business. In peritoneal dialysis business, I have great confidence that we're going to unveil a very different model of doing business in some parts of the world. We are working with payers at this moment, and I think that would be a very interesting way of expanding the use of PD, which has proven to be, economically and from the Access point of view, a better way forward for the patient and for the system. And with SHARESOURCE, we're going to continue to invest there. I see us very focused on the M&A area associated with organic growth in our generic injectable business. We think we have a platform opportunity at the moment, plus our internal growth engines in terms of new molecules, which we're accelerating. So all of this gives me the confidence that we can achieve 4% to 5% in a couple of years. I tell you, we are trimming our portfolio where we're moving a significant amount of unprofitable dollars, which will boost our 2017 bottom line, but cleaning up the portfolio and simplifying Baxter is also part of the playbook. So the playbook is innovation, really good capital allocation practices, use of capital dollars in a way that was different in the past. As you can see, our free cash flow numbers will allow us to generate more profitability for the company. And lastly, when we talk about transformation, it's not just cost reduction and reduction of personnel, but it's also the complete restructuring of the company in terms of its processes. Baxter grew up to be a very complicated company with a lot of SKUs, and we're working very hard to the office of the business transformation to redo that. So that accumulation of factors give us pretty good odds of hitting the numbers. We just need to continue forth with a lot of tenacity to achieve what we set forth to do."

Do we have price increases? We do have price increases like many companies. But the sustainability, what I see in the long term, is neutral to slight positive on pricing. So I want to make that very clear. The other thing is, how do you sustain that top line with transforming the gross margin contribution and participating in markets that have higher growth rates than our current one is, is using the playbook we're using today. So going into premixed and going into perhaps the manufacturing of very difficult-to-make APIs give us gross margins much, much different than we current today have in terms of average for the company. So we will double down on that. So Jay's comments in the very beginning about redeploying of R&D in the fourth quarter is actually doubling down in all the programs that we have in bringing new molecules to premix using our capability of -- we call the GALAXY. Looking into adjacencies and doubling the amount of R&D in biosurgery is another sustainable way of being in this business. Creating local initiatives, that we are, and right now, we have more than probably 70 local initiatives in all countries. Remember, Baxter is 60% outside U.S. sales, and we had put in place a franchise system at the company that completely took away the ability of our local and regional businesses to operate a little bit more independent. And we have great opportunities that will total a significant amount of money in the next 3 to 4 years that will sustain our top line, revamping our R&D organization to be more focused by business than focus in overall commerce. So there's a significant amount of things we're doing. They are not related directly to price but eventually place a rolling pricing because your mix will be different, the products have higher margin, and we'll change the profile of the company. It's not an easy thing to do, but we're working very hard to do it right. Hence, one of the things that we haven't rushed into doing was acquiring companies. We want to make sure that we have the discipline to acquire the companies where it matters and be strategically accretive to our business."

But based on what I did in my past and looking at what we're doing today, there is a vast difference in our approach, and I truly believe that our people will be able to do what we set forth to do at the savings that we set or even better. So things are coming together very well. One thing I want to give credit to Baxter and the Baxter management and Baxter employees is once we set our compass to the right direction here, they really execute very quickly. I was surprised how much momentum we got out of simplification and savings. So the folks of our company have done a phenomenal job embracing these changes, and those are not easy changes to make. So in summary, we are happy with the result and satisfied, by the way, and this gives us confidence that probably we will overachieve on our long-range plan targets."

And so while there weren't onetimers in place, we do expect to see a -- what I call downtick, you called 200 to 300 basis points of deterioration in the fourth quarter, which I think is fair. There's -- and I -- as I said, there's a couple of factors, right? It's probably split roughly evenly between R&D and SG&A. From an R&D standpoint, one of the areas we really want to accelerate and we recognize investments today will yield dividends in a couple of years relates to biosurgery. So we started to accelerate spending there. There are a number of programs that will begin in earnest in the fourth quarter that will facilitate that. And then to Joe's comment earlier, this point of care, another very exciting development for us. It's got a lot of benefits for the patients. It's a great program for us. It also allows us to run a capital-light model relative to the historic way of delivering PD solutions to patients. So very exciting developments, but they have a cost associated with them. We do expect to see that impact our margin by 1 point roughly. And then SG&A, it's maybe a little bit more than that. For us, Q3 was a low level of SG&A spending. The Q4 number, we're expecting to move back up to roughly the Q2 level. We would historically expect to see a Q4 uptick. Q3 is typically a lower SG&A spend quarter in part because of the August month, which is a holiday in many parts of the world. So for us, we're being prudent and thinking about an uptick in spending to occur in the fourth quarter. But then to the last point, we've got to accelerate the top line. That is a clear charge of our entire company, and that takes some investments as well. We have empowered our international organization to begin spending on a number of initiatives. There's no impact on the sales line related to these of note in 2016, but these investments will start to pay dividends and self-fund in '17 and '18. So very exciting development there, good investments to make. We track and monitor these investments on a monthly and quarterly basis. But in combination, these elements lead to a deterioration -- slight deterioration from this 16% level. Having said all of that, to Joe's point, we shared some projections in May of 2016. For margin in 2018, we said 14% to 15%. In 2020, we said 17% to 18%. We have a higher likelihood of overachieving those numbers as we sit here today. That's clear."

So Jay, I wonder, can you -- do you have a sense for the underlying growth rate if you back out the -- either the product lines or the geographies that you're exiting in that business? And then secondly, if you look at organic growth opportunities within Hospital Products, can you talk about just -- even just getting the entire portfolio approved in all geographies, can you help us understand kind of the organic growth opportunity within -- and I guess I'm thinking more injectables and nutrition. That's question #1."

Look, the overall hospital business, as far as the exits that took place, it actually was slightly tilted towards Renal. So we looked at the India business. We made some decisions related to IVs in PD. In Turkey, we looked at our clinics business along with the IV business there. But on balance, I would say slightly more of an impact in the -- slightly more of an impact in Renal than it was in the hospital business. To be clear, we've had outstanding performance in the U.S. hospital business, right? The 6% growth has been quite good, and internationally, the growth is below that. And so you asked a great question, which is, how do we accelerate growth outside the U.S.? The U.S. has benefited from a number of factors which are not quite present internationally. We've had the benefit of a new product launch, the SIGMA SPECTRUM pump. We've had very solid performance coming from our new Nutrition business, and we've seen sort of adequate performance coming out of our Surgical Care business. But the real standout performance comes from the U.S. Fluid Systems business. Outside the U.S., we have not had the benefit of a product launch like we've had in the U.S. And so for us, how do we address some new products perhaps from a business development standpoint outside the U.S.? For example, in the Fluid Systems business, that's a real challenge and opportunity for us as we look to accelerate performance outside the U.S. In addition, our Nutrition business, which in the quarter in the United States grew in double digits, grew in low single digits outside the U.S. And so for us, another real area of focus has been accelerating the nutrition performance outside the U.S., and that will continue to be an area where we'll invest. Some of the investment initiatives are targeting nutrition growth outside the U.S. So those are a few of the factors. I mean, it's kind of a difficult question to answer in the sense that it really is multiproduct, multi-geography. But it's safe to say that accelerating performance -- Renal outside the U.S. has seen outstanding performance. 5% for the quarter, that was a very solid performance for us. Accelerating the hospital outside the United States becomes a core area of focus for us in, in particular as we move to 2017."

We are extremely disciplined when it comes to how we look at our shareholders' money. And the ability to drive value is fundamentally important to us. So at the moment, we are looking at 3 specific targets that we think have good value for the company. The competition sometimes is irrational about how people are paying for some of the targets, and we don't go there. We don't want to be part of that group. We want to make sure that everything that we pay for has a way of paying back to the company and to the shareholders. So we are very diligent. I meet with the team every month. Every other week, I get updates. We just have hired our new head of M&A, started with us about 1.5 weeks ago, very talented. We'll not -- I want our investors to understand that we're very focused on that, but we will never forget our responsibility in managing our shareholders' money. And we don't see it as our money. It's our shareholders', so we're going to make sure that investments we make are very well thought out. I also challenge our team internally to think a little broader when we -- people look at acquisitions and make sure that we understand all the value is being captured. So this has been a learning curve for Baxter. We have not done that in the past and I think is a good practice. So as we get more mature, we are probably going to see some things happen in the future."

I will begin this morning by sharing some comments on our performance and progress. Then I will turn it over to Jay who will take a closer look at the financials and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. After that, we'll open up for Q&A. 
We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We continue to see momentum building across the organization as we implement the strategies outlined at our investor conference to enhance financial performance through reshaping our portfolio, transforming our cost structure and effectively deploying capital. 
As you saw in our press release, Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. These results were driven by continued strong performance of Fluid Systems in U.S. and peritoneal dialysis and acute renal therapies globally. 
Adjusting Baxter's results for the impact of cyclophosphamide and last year's $20 million order of PROTOPAM, sales in the quarter increased 6% globally. 
On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share. This reflects the benefit of solid sales growth, along with our ongoing focus on expense management and operational excellence. 
Now take you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where I will address sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance. 
Global sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 3%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, Hospital Products sales advanced 7% globally, reflecting 13% growth in the U.S. and 1% growth internationally. 
Now to break out Hospital Products at a franchise level. Sales in Fluid Systems totaled $576 million, up 11%. These results reflect continued strength in the U.S., driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions, along with the strong growth in Access sets resulting from the ongoing successful launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM. Note that this quarter, we anniversary the launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM, which is continuing to drive solid performance and increased market share. 
Next, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, decreasing 4%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, sales increased 6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by U.S. nutrition, which benefited from strong sales of vitamins and amino acids, as well as our recently launched premixed generic injectable, Cefazolin and VANCOMYCIN saline. In addition, this quarter, we launched NUMETA G13E in Europe. These expand our NUMETA pediatric line with the only ready-to-use triple-chamber IV nutrition product for preterm infants. NUMETA utilizes Baxter's proprietary olive oil-based lipid, which has been shown to be immunoneutral, thereby reducing the risk of inflammation for the patient. Baxter is the only manufacturer to utilize olive oil-based lipids as part of our multichambered nutritional product offering. 
Moving to Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products. Third quarter sales totaled $320 million. Global growth in the quarter was flat to the prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in biosurgery, offset by lower sales of anesthesia products. Anesthesia was impacted by the timing of certain government austerity measures in Europe and the timing of certain shipments internationally. 
Our industry-leading inhaled anesthetics portfolio continues to represent a solid platform for future growth and global expansion. 
Finally, in Hospital Products. BioPharma Solutions, our contract manufacturing business, generated sales of $122 million, an increase of 15%. This growth reflects the benefit of an easier comp for the prior year, along with increased customer demand for products produced in our cytotoxic manufacturing facility in Germany. 
Turning next to our Renal business. Renal sales were $977 million globally, up 6%. This reflects ongoing momentum in peritoneal dialysis or PD, which delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth internationally. PD growth is being driven by an expanding patient base, favorable pricing in U.S. and the ongoing launches of our new APD cycler, AMIA in the U.S. and HOMECHOICE CLARIA outside the U.S. These systems feature our innovative SHARESOURCE technology, which was also recently approved in Japan. SHARESOURCE will be a defining feature for our new Kaguya APD cycler in Japan, which we expect to gain local market approval shortly. 
Additionally, Q3 results reflect the positive impact of our acute renal business, which delivered double-digit growth globally. This reflects growing global demand for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT, which we're well positioned to address with our market-leading Prismaflex platform. Acute care is a fast-growing market where we have a substantial opportunity to serve patients and clinicians with high-value products. So this will remain a growing area of emphasis as we look ahead. 
Growth in Renal was somewhat offset by performance in in-center hemodialysis. We're taking a deliberate approach to improving profitability in our HD business. As you may have seen in our press release yesterday, we launched our novel and proprietary HDx therapy, enabled by our differentiated Theranova dialyzer. 
HDx therapy with Theranova has the potential to improve outcomes and raise the standard of treatment for end-stage renal disease patients. It has just launched in France, Australia and New Zealand and will launch in several other Western European markets before the end of the year. 
That's a brief snapshot of our Q3 results. I would like to close my comments by putting our quarterly performance in a broader, strategic context. At our investor conference in May, we identified 3 critical drivers that would elevate our performance to top quartile levels: portfolio innovation management; operational excellent -- excellence rather, excellence; capital allocation. The results we have seen year-to-date reflect the progress we have made across these 3 levers. 
In portfolio and innovation management, we have selectively exited products from certain global markets when our presence and potential were no longer in line with our go-forward strategy, while ensuring these markets continue to have alternate care options available for the patients. 
We have also continued our candid assessment of legacy R&D, discontinuing several programs either in noncore areas or where our prospects did not merit projected resources and demands. Choices like these are enabling us to refocus our investment on high-potential, high-value R&D and on a more strategic sales and marketing opportunities in biosurgery, PD and nutrition, premixed injectables and more. 
The third quarter results to a pivotal quarter in our cost transformation efforts. In recent months, we have executed plans to rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure or sale of a number of facilities in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. These actions will streamline and simplify our operations and better position us to manage costs while continuing to address patient and customer needs across the globe. 
And earlier this month, we began a wave of organizational restructuring in our global commercial operations and certain other functions, which was the outcome of a rigorous zero-based organizational assessment. This streamlining is expected to generate a higher-performing organization, along with cost savings that we contemplated in our May investor conference. 
Efforts like this support a leaner cost base and, again, the opportunity to channel investment in new ways. Innovation is our -- is, of course, the most crucial ingredient in our ongoing success. And you will continue to see capital allocation choices that reinvest in the business to bolster R&D as well as ongoing sustainable top line growth and margin expansion. And as you have heard me say repeatedly, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities in our core growth areas and high-potential adjacencies. Any likely news on this front should be interpreted as a sign of our discipline in assessing deals with strategic fit and financial merit. 
So in sum, our success this quarter represents significant progress on our strategic journey. And while we are pleased, we're not satisfied. We will continue to make progress on our journey to transform Baxter into a top-quartile company. 
And with that, I will turn over to Jay who will walk you through the financials. Then we'll open it up for your questions."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter. And on a reporte",1251,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. 
Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter. And on a reported basis, sales grew 3%. Growth came in at the high end of our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in PD and nutrition therapies. 
Walking through the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 44.9% represents an improvement of more than 100 basis points over the prior year, driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and favorable manufacturing performance in the quarter. 
Adjusted SG&A totaled $611 million and decreased 9% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the benefit from lower pension expense. 
TSA income totaled approximately $25 million in the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as need for these services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. 
During the third quarter, we did report a charge of approximately $130 million for restructuring activities, of which approximately $100 million was related to employee termination costs, which are expected to generate over $100 million of annual savings once fully implemented. As Joe mentioned, these actions were initiated earlier this month and were contemplated in the long-term financial guidance we provided in May. We will continue to optimize our cost structure as we move forward. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. While we did benefit in the quarter from the discontinuation of selected programs, we expect to begin redeploying that spend in areas like biosurgery and premixed injectables beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by positive project -- product mix, lower R&D spend and the benefit of our initiatives to control spending and reduce expenses. This represents a 480 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense was $14 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and executed a $1.6 billion 3-tranche debt offering consisting of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes. Proceeds from this offering were used to retire a series of existing bonds maturing in the near to intermediate term as well as pay off all of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the transaction, Baxter's bond maturity profile increased from an average of 9 years to 15 years, and our average coupon rate declined by nearly 1%. 
Adjusted other income totaled $4 million in the quarter, primarily resulting from a foreign exchange gain on a balance sheet position. The adjusted tax rate was 22% for the quarter, slightly higher than expectations, driven by earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.43 to $0.45 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.11 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to a higher share count and tax rate. 
Along with our equity-for-equity exchange, which we executed in the latter part of the second quarter, during the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $40 million or approximately 1 million shares during the quarter. These repurchases were more than offset by higher-than-expected option-related dilution given Baxter's stock performance during the quarter. 
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales. On a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%. 
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 2%. We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 3% to 4% or approximately 5%, excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. 
Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of low double digits for Fluid Systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. 
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline versus the prior year, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full year sales forecast for cyclo and now expect full year sales of $210 million with the assumption that no additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS or 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of both cyclo and PROTOPAM. 
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow approximately 1%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to increase low single digits. 
For the Renal business, we now expect full year sales to increase 4% to 5%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect an operating margin of approximately 13%, a 100 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance and a 200 basis point improvement relative to our original guidance. This increase is driven by improved sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses. 
We expect interest expense to total approximately $70 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $55 million, which does not reflect -- which does reflect a benefit of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to the disposition of an equity investment. 
For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 21%, driven by the expected mix of earnings. For full year 2016, we anticipate an average share count of 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.88 to $1.91 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share. 
Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion and CapEx of approximately $800 million, resulting in approximately $650 million in free cash flow. This represents an increase of 30% from our original guidance of $500 million. 
We're applying the same discipline to managing capital expenditures as we are to our expense base, which has resulted in a benefit of approximately $100 million in lower CapEx for the year. In addition, we have kicked -- we have initiated programs focused on improving our days payable and days receivable ratios, which will benefit operating cash flow going forward. 
Specific to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The growth does represent a deceleration from previous quarters given our previously announced decision to exit select markets outside the U.S. The collective impact of these exits impact top line by approximately 1 percentage point. In addition, lower cyclo sales compared to the prior year also negatively impact top line by approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter. Adjusting for these 2 factors, growth in the quarter would be approximately 4%, which is in line with our long-term projections. 
And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share. This guidance reflects increased investments in R&D and incremental investments in SG&A. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

What would drive that depression sort of sequentially? And obviously, if you do 16% here in the third quarter versus your sort of 14%, 15% outlook for '18, how are you feeling about those long-term margin targets? So fourth quarter and obviously the '18 outlook, and then a quick follow-up."

So as far as the fourth quarter goes, overall, we were obviously very pleased with the margin performance in the third quarter. So 16% represents the highest quarterly margin target that we've achieved since the spinoff. As we move to Q4, we do expect a slight downtick in the operating margin of the business, and really, there's a couple of drivers of that. One is we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments in both biosurgery and premixed injectables, as I mentioned. And so that will be one factor that increases the R&D spending relative to our current level. And then the second item relates to SG&A. We do expect a slight uptick as well in SG&A in the fourth quarter as a percent of sales. There's a couple of factors going on there. One is we do have historic seasonality. So if you look at Baxter over the last many years, we have -- we normally have an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We do expect that to repeat. And then the second factor that's going on with respect to SG&A is one of the topics we discussed in our May investor conference relates to what we call local initiatives, the idea that given the diverse geographic portfolio that we have in place and the product portfolio, we really have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by unlocking some of the entrepreneurial spirit outside the U.S. But frankly, that comes with it an SG&A cost. And so over the course of the last quarter, we have approved a number of investment initiatives, which we will -- we believe will benefit 2017 and '18 but do have a slight cost associated with them. So for these reasons, we do expect a slight downtick as it relates to the overall margin but, again, feel very confident in the operational performance. The -- as we look to 2017, I think it's too early to get into forecast for 2017. What I can tell you is in our May investor conference, we shared a series of projections for 2018 and 2020. And it is clear, the data points that we have point to accelerated performance relative to those expectations. So we have a higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers and exceed those numbers today than we did when we shared them in May of 2016."

We're -- one of the numbers that I think the team is most proud of is the cash -- the free cash flow performance. As I mentioned in the script, we're increasing it from $500 million to $650 million, and really, there's a couple of different components to that. One is operating cash flow, we're raising approximately $50 million. And this is an area where I believe there will be more substantial benefits from some of the programs that we've initiated this year in future years. So we're spending a lot of time as a team on working capital. Days payable, days sales outstanding and the inventory, how can we drive that down? And those are balances that you don't switch on overnight. But over time, with rigor and focus, you can drive real result in these categories. So we don't really have much benefit this year. But 2017, '18, '19, you'll expect to see some meaningful working capital improvements. Where we were able to drive an impact this year, and frankly, I believe this will be sustainable, is in CapEx. We did a couple of things this year which I think provided a very real benefit. First, we did a zero-based budget for CapEx, which we review quarterly with our senior leadership team. So our top executives at the company sit down on a quarterly basis, and the result of that is twofold: One, we did cancel a number of low value-adding programs, but second, for every single program that we had, the challenge to the team was, how can we do this more cost-effectively? And the results were very, very impressive. So the second piece relates to an incentive change that we put in place at the beginning of the year. For our top employees, we have a short-term incentive plan for the top several thousand employees. And last year, there was no cash flow component to this. This year, recognizing the challenge that we faced, with CapEx being 9% of sales, we installed a free cash flow trigger for our short-term incentive plan. By focusing on free cash flow now, we have our entire organization geared and charging towards driving improvements in this important metric. So while that's harder to quantify, I believe that that's paid a real dividend in our numbers and creativity as we think about addressing CapEx spending. But frankly, this is one area where I believe we have achieved a new normal and will continue to drive performance from here."

And I would say it was -- contributing to it were gross margin, SG&A leverage and some R&D leverage. From a gross margin standpoint, let's start with that. There were a number of factors in play. We've talked a lot about this concept of portfolio management and business mix and upgrading the business mix. And as we look at the Q3 results from Baxter, you start to see that story playing out. So for example, we saw a very strong performance in our U.S. hospital business in the sets area and Access. Our sets in the United States grew approximately 20%. That simple business mix factor contributed to our margin. And as we increase the installed base in the United States of SIGMA SPECTRUM, we'll continue to benefit from this mix factor as it moves forward. From an international standpoint, you'll see that we have lower Fluid Systems sales. But in areas like Renal in particular, where we had double-digit acute growth, and PD growth, where we've been very focused on accelerating growth, those are 2 good-margin areas that provide an uplift from a business mix standpoint. And finally, from a business mix standpoint, you heard Joe comment earlier in this call about how we're going to manage in-center HD for profitability, very focused on driving this. So while that business had lower sales, it had a business mix and, from our standpoint, focus on profitability. Those are the 3 examples from a gross margin standpoint where business mix played an impact. The second comment related to gross margin is manufacturing and performance. Overall, we had solid manufacturing performance. We had good volumes in Q2 and Q3. The result of that is a P&L benefit from a manufacturing standpoint. We'll expect to continue driving manufacturing performance going forward. This is a real area of focus for us. How can we effectively utilize our facilities? In Joe's prepared remarks, you heard him reference, we've closed or sold a number of facilities over the course of this year. That leads to better leveraging of the network. The final piece related to gross margin is this idea of, how can we think creatively about our business arrangements, either through pricing or being thoughtful about the services that we provide? A simple example of this is we're really focused in our U.S. Renal business on limiting the amount of overnight shipping that occurs. For us, that has historically been a real cost that we've borne, and it's impacted our margin. By focusing on that, we're able to drive a better margin. So those are the 3 drivers that have impacted our gross margin. Moving to R&D. We made a couple of tough decisions over the course of this year with respect to project -- a project like VIVIA. And so as a result of that, we saw lower R&D spending in the quarter. Now to my earlier comment, I do expect an uptick in this as we start to reinvest in some exciting new areas for us that have nearer-term paybacks than the VIVIA project. But in the quarter, this idea of rigorous capital allocation did play out in the R&D spend. And then finally, from the SG&A standpoint, I would make a couple of comments here. First, this idea of zero-based spending, challenging every single dollar that we have in place, that's something that the company has adopted from a process standpoint. So as we went through our budgeting process this year, we had a very rigorous zero-based spending approach, a zero-based organization approach in place, applying these techniques to our cost structure. But I think beyond that, culturally, the entire organization is incredibly aware of spending and driving results. The number of ideas that we're generating from our organization at large with respect to simplification, with respect to savings ideas is remarkable. And that simple phenomena has played out in our SG&A numbers for the quarter."

So overall, there's essentially 2 drivers of the deceleration in the fourth quarter. One is cyclo. While we don't -- we're not anticipating an incremental competitor in cyclophosphamide, we do expect lower levels than prior years, down about $20 million or roughly 1 point of growth to $45 million in the quarter. So that's a deceleration that we've expected and kind of consistent with how we thought about things. As we look at the other area that has impacted our Q4 results, we have always talked about this idea of rigorously going through our portfolio and ensuring that every single sale that we make is one that contributes positively to the economics of Baxter. And so to -- in support of that, we did walk away from roughly $130 million in sales on an annual basis, which amounts to roughly 1 point of growth impact in the quarter. Now the good news is this has limited to no impact on the bottom line. The sales were essentially break-even, and we've been able to eliminate all the costs associated with those sales. So while, on the bottom line, there's no impact, it does impact the top line a bit. If I were to adjust for these 2 factors, the 2% growth would be more like our normal expected run rate growth of 4%."

First thing we did was completely reallocate capital. If I show today to you the dollars invested by franchise in the company versus 12 months ago, you see a significant difference. We are doubling down in areas like biosurgery. It's going to take us a couple of years to pick up momentum there because we fell behind in a lot of different things, but we are looking at some M&A augmentation for the short term. We also are doubling down in the PD business. In peritoneal dialysis business, I have great confidence that we're going to unveil a very different model of doing business in some parts of the world. We are working with payers at this moment, and I think that would be a very interesting way of expanding the use of PD, which has proven to be, economically and from the Access point of view, a better way forward for the patient and for the system. And with SHARESOURCE, we're going to continue to invest there. I see us very focused on the M&A area associated with organic growth in our generic injectable business. We think we have a platform opportunity at the moment, plus our internal growth engines in terms of new molecules, which we're accelerating. So all of this gives me the confidence that we can achieve 4% to 5% in a couple of years. I tell you, we are trimming our portfolio where we're moving a significant amount of unprofitable dollars, which will boost our 2017 bottom line, but cleaning up the portfolio and simplifying Baxter is also part of the playbook. So the playbook is innovation, really good capital allocation practices, use of capital dollars in a way that was different in the past. As you can see, our free cash flow numbers will allow us to generate more profitability for the company. And lastly, when we talk about transformation, it's not just cost reduction and reduction of personnel, but it's also the complete restructuring of the company in terms of its processes. Baxter grew up to be a very complicated company with a lot of SKUs, and we're working very hard to the office of the business transformation to redo that. So that accumulation of factors give us pretty good odds of hitting the numbers. We just need to continue forth with a lot of tenacity to achieve what we set forth to do."

Do we have price increases? We do have price increases like many companies. But the sustainability, what I see in the long term, is neutral to slight positive on pricing. So I want to make that very clear. The other thing is, how do you sustain that top line with transforming the gross margin contribution and participating in markets that have higher growth rates than our current one is, is using the playbook we're using today. So going into premixed and going into perhaps the manufacturing of very difficult-to-make APIs give us gross margins much, much different than we current today have in terms of average for the company. So we will double down on that. So Jay's comments in the very beginning about redeploying of R&D in the fourth quarter is actually doubling down in all the programs that we have in bringing new molecules to premix using our capability of -- we call the GALAXY. Looking into adjacencies and doubling the amount of R&D in biosurgery is another sustainable way of being in this business. Creating local initiatives, that we are, and right now, we have more than probably 70 local initiatives in all countries. Remember, Baxter is 60% outside U.S. sales, and we had put in place a franchise system at the company that completely took away the ability of our local and regional businesses to operate a little bit more independent. And we have great opportunities that will total a significant amount of money in the next 3 to 4 years that will sustain our top line, revamping our R&D organization to be more focused by business than focus in overall commerce. So there's a significant amount of things we're doing. They are not related directly to price but eventually place a rolling pricing because your mix will be different, the products have higher margin, and we'll change the profile of the company. It's not an easy thing to do, but we're working very hard to do it right. Hence, one of the things that we haven't rushed into doing was acquiring companies. We want to make sure that we have the discipline to acquire the companies where it matters and be strategically accretive to our business."

We got accelerated programs in place, and we're getting faster results on our zero-based organization, zero-based budget and zero-based spending, okay? So we pull things forward. But we also have come across a significant amount of opportunities that we initially did not anticipate. So I see us building a lot of confidence in probably overachieving our targets, okay? And I say that with no hesitation. I would say also that there is a portion of our restructuring that is more complex, which is the outsourcing and labor arbitration that is involved in changing our back-office profile. But based on what I did in my past and looking at what we're doing today, there is a vast difference in our approach, and I truly believe that our people will be able to do what we set forth to do at the savings that we set or even better. So things are coming together very well. One thing I want to give credit to Baxter and the Baxter management and Baxter employees is once we set our compass to the right direction here, they really execute very quickly. I was surprised how much momentum we got out of simplification and savings. So the folks of our company have done a phenomenal job embracing these changes, and those are not easy changes to make. So in summary, we are happy with the result and satisfied, by the way, and this gives us confidence that probably we will overachieve on our long-range plan targets."

You characterize the fourth quarter margin guidance as a slight downtick from Q3. But unless I'm doing my math wrong, it looks like operating margins will come down 200 to 300 basis points in Q4 versus Q3. So I guess I'm just curious, one, do I have my math right? And two, were there any onetimers in Q3 in that 16%? Or is that a clean number? And then maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the increase in spending in R&D from Q3 to Q4."

And so while there weren't onetimers in place, we do expect to see a -- what I call downtick, you called 200 to 300 basis points of deterioration in the fourth quarter, which I think is fair. There's -- and I -- as I said, there's a couple of factors, right? It's probably split roughly evenly between R&D and SG&A. From an R&D standpoint, one of the areas we really want to accelerate and we recognize investments today will yield dividends in a couple of years relates to biosurgery. So we started to accelerate spending there. There are a number of programs that will begin in earnest in the fourth quarter that will facilitate that. And then to Joe's comment earlier, this point of care, another very exciting development for us. It's got a lot of benefits for the patients. It's a great program for us. It also allows us to run a capital-light model relative to the historic way of delivering PD solutions to patients. So very exciting developments, but they have a cost associated with them. We do expect to see that impact our margin by 1 point roughly. And then SG&A, it's maybe a little bit more than that. For us, Q3 was a low level of SG&A spending. The Q4 number, we're expecting to move back up to roughly the Q2 level. We would historically expect to see a Q4 uptick. Q3 is typically a lower SG&A spend quarter in part because of the August month, which is a holiday in many parts of the world. So for us, we're being prudent and thinking about an uptick in spending to occur in the fourth quarter. But then to the last point, we've got to accelerate the top line. That is a clear charge of our entire company, and that takes some investments as well. We have empowered our international organization to begin spending on a number of initiatives. There's no impact on the sales line related to these of note in 2016, but these investments will start to pay dividends and self-fund in '17 and '18. So very exciting development there, good investments to make. We track and monitor these investments on a monthly and quarterly basis. But in combination, these elements lead to a deterioration -- slight deterioration from this 16% level. Having said all of that, to Joe's point, we shared some projections in May of 2016. For margin in 2018, we said 14% to 15%. In 2020, we said 17% to 18%. We have a higher likelihood of overachieving those numbers as we sit here today. That's clear."

Look, the overall hospital business, as far as the exits that took place, it actually was slightly tilted towards Renal. So we looked at the India business. We made some decisions related to IVs in PD. In Turkey, we looked at our clinics business along with the IV business there. But on balance, I would say slightly more of an impact in the -- slightly more of an impact in Renal than it was in the hospital business. To be clear, we've had outstanding performance in the U.S. hospital business, right? The 6% growth has been quite good, and internationally, the growth is below that. And so you asked a great question, which is, how do we accelerate growth outside the U.S.? The U.S. has benefited from a number of factors which are not quite present internationally. We've had the benefit of a new product launch, the SIGMA SPECTRUM pump. We've had very solid performance coming from our new Nutrition business, and we've seen sort of adequate performance coming out of our Surgical Care business. But the real standout performance comes from the U.S. Fluid Systems business. Outside the U.S., we have not had the benefit of a product launch like we've had in the U.S. And so for us, how do we address some new products perhaps from a business development standpoint outside the U.S.? For example, in the Fluid Systems business, that's a real challenge and opportunity for us as we look to accelerate performance outside the U.S. In addition, our Nutrition business, which in the quarter in the United States grew in double digits, grew in low single digits outside the U.S. And so for us, another real area of focus has been accelerating the nutrition performance outside the U.S., and that will continue to be an area where we'll invest. Some of the investment initiatives are targeting nutrition growth outside the U.S. So those are a few of the factors. I mean, it's kind of a difficult question to answer in the sense that it really is multiproduct, multi-geography. But it's safe to say that accelerating performance -- Renal outside the U.S. has seen outstanding performance. 5% for the quarter, that was a very solid performance for us. Accelerating the hospital outside the United States becomes a core area of focus for us in, in particular as we move to 2017."

And now we have a strategy that is driving our -- seeking companies and seeking businesses and technologies. So now we have the right construct here, which is a strategy driving M&A. We are extremely disciplined when it comes to how we look at our shareholders' money. And the ability to drive value is fundamentally important to us. So at the moment, we are looking at 3 specific targets that we think have good value for the company. The competition sometimes is irrational about how people are paying for some of the targets, and we don't go there. We don't want to be part of that group. We want to make sure that everything that we pay for has a way of paying back to the company and to the shareholders. So we are very diligent. I meet with the team every month. Every other week, I get updates. We just have hired our new head of M&A, started with us about 1.5 weeks ago, very talented. We'll not -- I want our investors to understand that we're very focused on that, but we will never forget our responsibility in managing our shareholders' money. And we don't see it as our money. It's our shareholders', so we're going to make sure that investments we make are very well thought out. I also challenge our team internally to think a little broader when we -- people look at acquisitions and make sure that we understand all the value is being captured. So this has been a learning curve for Baxter. We have not done that in the past and I think is a good practice. So as we get more mature, we are probably going to see some things happen in the future."
