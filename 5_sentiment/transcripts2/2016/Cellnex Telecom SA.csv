Thank you so very much for your time today and please allow me to start by highlighting that we are very proud to present again a solid set of results. Results of our projects progressing and our core activities delivering a continued strong organic growth with sustainment demand, our portfolio of assets and services. 
If we moved to Slide #4, I would like to start by highlighting that 2015 have been a year of deliveries. We have met the guidance we shared with you, and we have show supporting 2014 our activity in our 3 strategic pillars. The first one is the organic growth. Organic growth means maximization of our existing portfolio to capture new revenues while efficiently managing our cost structure. hence, delivering an attractive operating leverage. The second one is to keep a robust quality with flexible access to debt and capital markets. The objective is to have a stable long-term balance sheet and a competitive cost, while retaining the financing flexibility required to capture new growth opportunities. And the third one, we are willing to play the role in the consolidation of the power landscape in Europe. In this sense, I would like to emphasize that our geographical focus is Europe. But our is better than nature allows us to reaching a long-term partner for our customers. And that's the only reason why we will execute a transaction is because we will create value our stockholders. And to ensure this is the case, we have a strict investment discipline. 
We move through Slide #5. We can approach 2 statistic examples that illustrate our strategic pillars. Organic growth in the Telecom Site Rental business had been strong in 2015 with an increase of PoPs of 8% mainly due to a multi-tenantcy services. That means more customers on our towers because they require additional locations mainly for a 4G rollout. Production of covenant debts and higher diversification mainly in the urban areas. It is also important to mention that after just 9 months of operations in Italy, the company that runs the towers we acquired from WIND in Italy, we have managed it to increase our tenancy ratio in the country. Thus, meeting our acquisition business plan so far.  I think this is a very good news for everyone. 
Looking into 2016 onwards, we believe the main driver for organic growth will be the rationalization of networks and in order to capture this growth, we have today identified around 2,000 towers that can be dismantled in this 2 countries we are present. We are actively and constantly working with different operators and we expect to present to you good news on this front in the very short term. The economical benefits of this new activity should start being visible from 2016, [ph] 2017. Moving to Slide #6, here you can see the main characteristics of our current debt structure. As a result of the refinancing process we carried out last year, we have managed to extend our maturities at a competitive cost, removed any additional covenants which might constrain our future growth, partially hedge our interest rates and diversify our sources of funds. This creates the appropriate platform to continue pursuing and manage progress, which are analyzed under strict validation criteria with a view to maximize leverage free cash flow per share, while minimizing the need for capital increases. With this capital structure in place, we will face no financial risks for the next 6 years as the first maturity in 2017 can be easily repaid with the cash generated by the group during this period. Our leverage stands today at EUR 927 million with the leverage ratio of 3.7x net debt EBITDA. 
Moving to Slide #7. This is just to remind you of the excellent M&A execution we have carried out during the last 4 years. We have an average acquisition of 2,000 towers per year at which has allowed us to grow at the low mid-teens CAGR in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring leveraging cash flow. And what's the next? Our first priority is to consolidate our processing Spain and Italy, and then we want to continue pursuing new projects in the main European countries like U.K., France and Germany. And these countries offer very attractive market dynamics and interesting opportunities that we are currently assessing. I would now like to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide you more details on this front."

And this is again to remind you that we have met the guidance we share with you back in August and that is constitutes an excellent starting point to meet 2016 market expectations. We have posted an adjusted EBITDA in line with market expectations, maintenance CapEx has been slightly below, working capital change is slightly positive thanks to our proactive management, interest payments have been very well contained and cash tax had been in with what we anticipated. All these leads to our net debt position as of end of the year below market expectations. 
If we move to Slide #10, these strong deliveries has also been recognized by the market during 2016, [indiscernible] share price up to 23% when compared to our ideal price of EUR 14 per share and a 38% [ph] outperformance when compared to the index. Our share price has recently experienced a high degree of volatility, but our fundamentals remain equally strong and market estimates has been maintained, providing a target price of around EUR 18 per share with max side potential of 27%. 
Moving to Slide #11, it is important to make emphasis again on our ability to withstand the of services we can provide over our current asset base and with our available resources. As already discussed, 2015 has been a year when multi-tenancy has provide us with a very strong organic growth and 2016 will be a year when rationalization projects will play a key role. But we are also actively monitoring and analyzing new potential business lines, which may provide us with future revenues and streams. Built to suit is an area where we will use an opportunistic approach. Today, we already have an agreement with WIND in Italy to build 400 towers over 6 years. In 2014, we entered into an agreement with for the deployment of the first global network with national coverage in Spain. We are now looking at expanding these network by adding new locations. A field where we also see an opportunity is backhaul, which consists of acquiring the right of use of existing fiber-to-the-tower or the deployment of new fiber where such an alternative is not available. This will represent a way to increase the effectiveness of our portfolio, and we will be able to offer high-speed connectivity. That's avoiding future capacities bottlenecks if that data demand continues rising at the current rates. And the economics are similar to our core business. CapEx is deployed on an that can be shared across multiple customers in exchange for a long-term contract. We are asserting potential revenues from what we call managed services. Advisory services for operators in noncore countries in order to help them with tower outsourcing processes. These services may include assistance during the pre-acquisition stage of towers supporting the transfer of assets to the new TowerCo, as well as supporting the further M&A plans. It is worth mentioning that this not equity contribution by service. 
In addition to our traditional macro tower business, we are also accessing the potential to increase our presence in the small cell tower. We currently have a 8-year contract with the Barcelona municipality by which we can sell collocation services for small cells placed through the city. In this regard and leveraging on this concept, we are pleased to announce to you that we have just reached an agreement with to deploy the first small cell network in Barcelona, with the potential to add more operators in the future into this network. 
If we moved to Slide #12. We described our experience in the areas of the small cells, IOT and As I have just mentioned it, we already have a contract with the municipality of Barcelona which grant access to the infrastructure and public locations in order to serve collocation services for small cells. Such agreements are of key importance as having access to premium locations in urban area, and is the key differentiation factor when deploying a small cell network. Today, we are analyzing the possibility with different MNOs to initiate non-pilot project with the objective to shape the business model and the most feasible locations and provide high-capacity connectivity in areas of a strong data demand. As I just mentioned it, we have just reached an agreement with Orange for the deployment of the first small cell network in Barcelona. 
In the area of the Internet of Things, we have deployed a national coverage network data on technology for our customer security. To date, we provide the network infrastructure, backhaul connectivity and network maintenance, but we are also analyzing the possibility to expand our presence in other areas of the value chains. 
Finally, in the area of Smart Cities, we currently manage and maintain the Wi-Fi network of the city of Barcelona allowing us to offer innovative services to third party over this network such as Wi-Fi [indiscernible], it means active interconnection of access points or platform -- has a platform of offload, I mean mobile data download over Wi-Fi networks. 
Moving to Slide #13. Let me now please in this section reminding our main highlight for 2015. We are now a public company after a very successful IPO with the market supporting our equity story based on becoming the tower consolidator in Europe. We have managed to show a continued strong performance in the Telecom Site Rental business, basic and organic growth and accretive acquisitions, while setting the foundations of future organic opportunities. By the end of 2015, we held the position #25 in terms of market capitalization of the Spanish companies. The 20th of July we successfully complete our inaugural debt capital markets transaction with a EUR 600 million bond with a 7-year maturity and a coupon of 3.125%. The bond was 6x [ph] oversubscribed and has no covenants allowing for future growth. We carry out a transformational deal led on 1 year ago by acquiring 7,377 towers from WIND in Italy. The integration process of this new company is on track and we are extremely pleased with its performance better than anticipated. We have started implementing the first stage of our efficiency program. We have paid our first dividend. The national mass re-tendering process has been complete, and we are now working with our plus customers in order to accelerate the fusion. Additionally, with 700 megahertz run has been allocated through TV news. At least until 2026 [ph]. Finally, 6 months ago, we shared a guidance with you that we have met which proved our focus on delivery. Now please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa who will explain you in detail our 2015 business from financial performance. Please, Jose Manuel."

So regarding the 2015 business performance, let me start by highlighting that we have met the guidance we shared with you 2 quarters ago and that we have managed to meet this guidance mainly because of the strong organic growth in 2015, leading, at the same time, to a cash conversion ratio of 83%. 
Moving to business on Slide 16. In terms facility, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 8% compared to December 2015. As to our guidance for the rollout, the reduction of coverage gaps and higher network densification needs. In 2015, we have doubled the size of our tower portfolio by acquiring 300 towers from Telefonica [indiscernible] 2015 and 7,377 towers from WIND back in March. It is worth mentioning that integration process of business company is on track and in less than 1 year of operations, we are proud of its performance, even better than we anticipated at the time of the acquisition. 
We are also paving the way for future organic growth by actively pursuing rationalization projects in its mobile operators looking for a reduction of cost base and maintained assets. In Italia, we see a scope of around 2,000 towers to lead the commission and by working intensely to announce an agreement. This strong performance of our telecom business more than offset the temporary impact from the shutdown of TV channels back in 2013, which we expect to bring back to normalized level this year. In dividend, we can confirm that been tendering 6 [indiscernible] has been completed and that we have time on all of the group that have been awarded in in a. We are now working closely with our customers in order to them it consent as soon as possible, and they are all now forecasting interest. Additionally, the risk of loss of a TV channel was completely removed. All national contest in have and the outcome of the has been positive. In the network services [indiscernible], we have also seen a strong performance in with the extension a network in the Valencia region and the network for station in the Barcelona area. As Tobias have stated earlier, we have deployed an the Internet of Things with national. We are analyzing the possibility to invest in backhauling for our customers, and we are also looking in the opportunity in Barcelona in the area of a small cell. Once operating we have done, and we believe we can in the short term, we keep analyzing any single opportunity we can to continue creating value for our shareholders. For example, the refinancing process in efficient capital structure continue capturing growth opportunities. Another is an program. we later and last but not least, we have implemented in order to structure our cash management. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see here the evolution of size, the under resulting consolidating tenancy ratio with the impact of activity changes. Despite its effect, we have continued to optimize our network through decommissioning and managed to grow organic by adding tenants in a few countries where we are present. It is very important to emphasize that in the period, we have increased the number of PoPs by 8% when compared to December 2014, reflecting the effectiveness of our portfolio for mobile operators. 
On Slide 18, we explained in detail the framework of the Telecom Site Rental Business in terms of revenues. And here, you can see contribute EUR 8 million to our cost savings will as [indiscernible]  as EUR 188 million in the same period. 
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA in Slide 19. You can see how the negative impact of the Broadcasting business is more than offset by inorganic and organic growth in the telecom high with the continuation of the organic growth for EUR 6 million in the year telecom
Slide 20, we now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 2%. All by has a Galata has a temporary loss of [indiscernible]. The Slide 21, let me now take some time explaining our recurring leverage free cash flow generation in detail. I would like to start by highlighting the recurring revenue free cash flow in 2015 have increased 28% when compared to 2014, and that will have managed to keep our sound cash conversion ratio at 83% [ph] even with temporary negative impact from our Broadcasting business. 
Looking to revenues, Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to the strong organic growth contribution and to acquisition. In the Broadcasting business, we have suffered the negative impact of the shutdown of which took place in late 2014, but this effect has partially been offset by the carried out in the first month of 2015. Please take into consideration that this is a one-off in the year with its associate revenues to be seen again in 2015. Network services and other revenues shows a strong increase due to the extension of contract terminal. 
Moving now to OpEx, we have a very well-contained constraint with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost with our recent decisions and incremental cost when Therefore protected on revenues. As the year progresses, we expect the businesses to start being more and more visible on our figures. On adjusted EBITDA, our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 235 million in line with our guidance and showing a strong 32% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital remain change remin slightly positive thanks to our strict management, and we expect this to re-trend going forward. When compared to last year, stock have decreased mainly because of different tax management measures. Maintenance CapEx impact during the [indiscernible] quarters breaking normalized level, decreasing money CapEx is mainly explained in the cost base, which also translates into more revenues in the period. And M&A investment increased on phase 2. on shareholder our board of directors will propose an annual shareholder's meeting the distribution of a final dividend of EUR 0.047 per share bringing to total dividend around to a again 2015 results to around EUR 20 million is around our 20% of our recurring leverage free cash flow for the second half of 2015 as stated in the IPO. 
Slide 22. Moving now to our balance sheet. Leverage has increased to 3.7x net debt adjusted annualized EBITDA. Below market consensus and also below our long-term average target or forecast. The group has increased the size of a total asset by amount slightly below EUR 1 billion [ph] due to of Galata. Our total equity has remained similar to 2014 with a change mainly due to the net profit in [indiscernible]. Our total work borrowings has increased by EUR 550 million in order to accomplish the acquisition and with our balance sheet now reflecting our new capital structure and our. 
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. It is worth mentioning that we have annualized the purchase price allocation process of Galata and provided are include going forward. With regard to income tax, it includes the nontax impact in deferred tax due to the change in the Italian tax rate applicable from 2017 onwards. This was obtained carryout by the Italian government as of December 28, 2015. net profit [indiscernible] EUR 48 million down when compared to last year due to the combined consolidation of the FX, [indiscernible]. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year, Slide 23. M&A investment has been dedicated in 2015 for inclusion of Galata, and 300 towers from Telefonica. Organic CapEx process, which is with earnings the of flowing and invested the levered of our efficiency plan and the process of in the context of our IPO. Additionally, our board has provide us with a new capital deployment tool with the acquisition of certain stock. With additional levers to make the most of attractive share price and for its future use in corporate transaction thus reducing the size capital increases. 
Going now to Slide 24. As H1 2015, results, there are several cost where we see room for improvement and that we constitute the basis of our current. The main contributor will be savings from leases. revenue statement the annual rent being paid and also extended ratio of ground lease concept. Also advantage we have on a lump sum being paid in advance lease reduction of the concept. The negative target around 5,000 sites and we believe we can extract savings around EUR 14 million in 2019 accumulated. But there on where we can additional savings. When it comes we will focus on reducing the amount of electricity use, as well as electricity currently fees currently, being paid with our supplier. In Italia, we are targeting a total of 800 sites with potential [indiscernible]. We are also upgrading our in order to make a more efficient use of spectrum maintain fees. are focus on of the internal processes to working efficiencies. 
Slide 25. This worth measure have started to implemented in 2015, and we will see the full benefit in 2019. With the aim to improve OpEx market transactions for next year. It is important to highlight that this time to backloaded part of the savings to 2018, 2019. CapEx will fall it that both category and as such, it will be the at the low teens and levered IRR. As you can see on the chart, evolution of objects reflecting full year impact and an inflation and any incremental OpEx gained to additional organic growth. This efficiency plan started an OpEx reduction of 5% of the 2019 OpEx result initially. 
Moving to Slide 26. In terms of the financial outlook for 2016, we believe we can provide a recurring leverage 10% higher than in 2015 and in line with the market expectations. Looking at the December division line, it is important to highlight that 88% of our revenues for 2015 are already fully. We expect to adjusted to grow around high teen mark and rest of the line the any project according to our A special mention to cash tax to 2015 this time  a higher income in 2016.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so very much for your time today and please allow me to start by highlighting that we are very proud to present again a solid set of results, with all of our projects progressing steadily and our core activities delivering a continued strong organic growth with sustained demand seen for our portfolio of assets and services. 
If we move to Slide #4, I would like to start by highlighting that 2015 have been a year of deliveries. We have met the guidance we shared with you, and we have done so supporting our activity in our 3 strategic pillars. The first one is the organic growth. Organic growth means maximization of our existing portfolio to capture new revenues while efficiently managing our cost structure hence delivering an attractive operating leverage. The second one is to keep a robust balance sheet with flexible access to debt and capital markets. The objective is to have a stable long-term balance sheet and a competitive cost, while retaining the financing flexibility required to capture new growth opportunities. And the third one, we are willing to play a key role in the consolidation of the power landscape in Europe. In this sense, I would like to emphasize that our geographical focus is Europe. But our [indiscernible] have been better than nature allows us to reaching a long-term partner for our customers. And that's the only reason why we will execute a transaction is because we will create value for our stockholders. And to ensure this is the case, we have a strict investment discipline. 
We move to Slide #5. We can approach 2 statistic examples that illustrate our strategic pillars. Organic growth in the Telecom Site Rental business has been strong in 2015 with an increase of PoPs of 8% mainly due to our multi-tenantcy services. That means more customers on our towers because they require additional locations mainly for a 4G rollout. Reduction of coverage gaps and higher densification mainly in the urban areas. It is also important to mention that after just 9 months of operations in Italy, the company that runs the towers we acquired from WIND in Italy, we have managed it to increase our tenancy ratio in the country. Thus, meeting our acquisition business plan so far. I think this is a very good news for everyone. 
Looking into 2016 onwards, we believe the main driver for organic growth will be the rationalization of our rapid networks. And in order to capture this growth, we have today identified around 2,000 towers that can be dismantled in the 2 countries we are present. We are actively and constantly working with different operators and we expect to present to you good news on this front in the very short term. The economical benefits of this new activity should start being visible from 2016, 2017. Moving to Slide #6. Here, you can see the main characteristics of our current debt structure. As a result of the refinancing process we carried out last year, we have managed to extend our maturities at a competitive cost, removed any additional covenants which might constrain our future growth, partially hedge our interest rates and diversify our sources of funds. This creates the appropriate platform to continue pursuing and manage projects, which are analyzed under strict value-creation criteria with a view to maximize levered free cash flow per share, while minimizing the need for capital increases. With this capital structure in place, we will face no financial risks for the next 6 years as the first maturity in 2020 can be easily repaid with the cash generated by the group during this period. Our leverage stands today at EUR 927 million with the leverage ratio of 3.7x net debt EBITDA. 
Moving to Slide #7. This is just to remind you of the excellent M&A execution we have carried out during the last 4 years with an average acquisition of 3,000 towers per year and which has allowed us to grow at the low mid-teens CAGR in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage in cash flow. And what's the next? Our first priority is to consolidate our presence in Spain and in Italy, and then we want to continue pursuing new projects in the main European countries like U.K., France and Germany. And these countries offer very attractive market dynamics and interesting opportunities that we are currently assessing. I would now like to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide you more details on this front."

We are today working on the second stake of the process and expect to submit our binding offer by mid-March. It is worth mentioning the importance in these kinds of projects of engaging a strategic local partner to capitalize an important no less financial standing of the project's framework.

And this is again to remind you that we have met the guidance we shared with you back in August and that is -- constitutes an excellent starting point to meet 2016 market expectations. We have posted an adjusted EBITDA in line with market expectations, maintenance CapEx has been slightly below, working capital change is slightly positive thanks to our proactive management, interest payments have been very well contained and cash tax have been in line with what we anticipated. All these leads to a net debt position as of end of the year below market expectations. 
If we move to Slide #10, these strong deliveries has also been recognized by the market during 2015, with Cellnex share price up to 23% when compared to our ideal price of EUR 14 per share and a 38% outperformance when compared to the IBEX index. Our share price has recently experienced a high degree of volatility, but our fundamentals remain equally strong and market estimates has been maintained, providing a target price of around EUR 18 per share with an upside potential of 27%. 
Moving to Slide #11. It is important to make emphasis again on our ability to extend the array of services we can provide over our current asset base and with our available resources. As already discussed, 2015 has been a year when multi-tenancy has provide us with a very strong organic growth and 2016 will be a year when rationalization projects will play a key role. But we are also actively monitoring and analyzing new potential business lines, which may provide us with future revenue streams. Built to suit is an area where we will use an opportunistic approach. Today, we already have an agreement with WIND in Italy to build 400 towers over 6 years. In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Securitas Direct for the deployment of the first global IoT network with national coverage in Spain. We are now looking at expanding these networks by adding new locations. A field where we also see an opportunity is backhauling, which consists of acquiring the right of use of existing fiber-to-the-tower or the deployment of new fiber where such an alternative is not available. This will represent a way to increase the effectiveness of our portfolio, as we will be able to offer high-speed connectivity. That's avoiding future capacities bottlenecks if the data demand continues rising at the current rates. And the economics are similar to our core business. CapEx is deployed on an infrastructure that can be shared across multiple customers in exchange for a long-term contract. We are outsourcing potential revenues from what we call managed services. Advisory services for operators in noncore countries in order to help them with tower outsourcing processes. These services may include assistance during the preacquisition stage of towers supporting the transfer of assets to the new TowerCo as well as supporting further M&A plans. It is worth mentioning that these partnerships involve no equity contribution by service. 
In addition to our traditional macro tower business, we are also accessing the potential to increase our presence in the small cell area. We currently have a 8-year contract with the Barcelona municipality by which we can sell collocation services for small cells placed through the city. In this regard, and leveraging on this concept, we are pleased to announce to you that we have just reached an agreement with Orange to deploy the first small cell network in Barcelona, with the potential to add more operators in the future into this network. 
If we moved to Slide #12. We describe our experience in the areas of the small cells, IoT in small cities. As I have just mentioned it, we already have a contract with the municipality of Barcelona which grant us access to German infrastructure and public locations in order to serve collocation services for the small cells. Such agreements are of key importance as having access to premium locations in urban area, and is the key differentiating factor when deploying a small cell network. Today, we are analyzing the possibility with different MNOs to initiate nonpilot projects with the objective to shape the business model and the most feasible locations and provide high-capacity connectivity in areas of a strong data demand. I just mentioned it, we have just reached an agreement with Orange for the deployment of the first small cell network in Barcelona. 
In the area of the Internet of Things, we have deployed a national coverage network based on Sigfox technology for our customer security [indiscernible]. To date, we provide the network infrastructure, backhaul connectivity and network maintenance, but we are also analyzing the possibility to expand our presence in other areas of the value chain. 
Finally, in the area of Smart Cities, we currently manage and maintain the WiFi network of the city of Barcelona allowing us to offer innovative services to third party over this network such as WiFi mesh, it means active interconnection of access points or platform -- has a platform of offload, I mean mobile data download over WiFi networks. 
Moving to Slide #13. Let me now please in this section reminding our main highlight for 2015. We are now a public company after a very successful IPO with the market supporting our equity story based on becoming the tower consolidator in Europe. We have managed to show a continued strong performance in the Telecom Site Rental business, basic and organic growth and accretive acquisitions, while setting the foundations for future organic opportunities. By the end of 2015, we held the position #25 in terms of market capitalization of the Spanish companies. The 20th of July we successfully complete our inaugural debt capital markets transaction with a EUR 600 million bond with a 7-year maturity and a coupon of 3.125%. The bond was 6x [ph] oversubscribed and has no covenants allowing for future growth. We carry out a transformational deal less than 1 year ago by acquiring 7,377 towers from WIND in Italy. The integration process of this new company is on track and we are extremely pleased with its performance better than anticipated. We have started implementing the first stage of our efficiency program. We have paid our first dividend. The national MUX retendering process has been complete, and we are now working with our customers in order to accelerate the flow chart [ph]. Additionally, with 700 megahertz band has been allocated through TV use at least until 2026. Finally, 6 months ago, we shared our guidance with you that we have met which proved our focus on delivery. Now please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa who will explain you in detail our 2015 business and financial performance. Please, Jose Manuel."

So regarding the 2015 business performance, let me start by highlighting that we have met the guidance we shared with you 2 quarters ago and that we have managed to meet this guidance mainly because of the strong organic growth in 2015",1921,"Thank you, Tobías. So regarding the 2015 business performance, let me start by highlighting that we have met the guidance we shared with you 2 quarters ago and that we have managed to meet this guidance mainly because of the strong organic growth in 2015, leading, at the same time, to a cash conversion ratio of 83%. 
Moving to the next slide, 16. In terms facility, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 8% compared to December 2015 [ph] as to our guidance for the rollout the reduction of coverage gaps and higher network densification needs. In 2015, we have doubled the size of our tower portfolio by acquiring 300 towers from Telefonica [indiscernible] 2015 and 7,677 towers from WIND back in March. It is worth mentioning that the integration process of business company [ph] is on track and in less than 1 year of operations, we are proud of its performance, even better than we anticipated at the time of the acquisition. 
We are also paving the way for future organic growth by actively pursuing rationalization projects with mobile operators looking for a reduction of the cost spend and maintain assets. In Italia, we see a scope of around 2,000 towers to lead the commission and by working intensely to announce an agreement. This strong performance of our telecom severance agreement more than offset the temporary impact from the shutdown of TV channels back in 2013, which we expect to bring back to normalized level this year. In [indiscernible], we can confirm that the tendering [ph] process of 6 [indiscernible] deals tenders have been completed and that we have signed [indiscernible] all of the groups that have been awarded [indiscernible]. We are now working closely with our customers in order to help them switch on [indiscernible] content as soon as possible, and they are all now broadcasting in [indiscernible]. Additionally, the risk of loss of a TV channel was completely removed. All national TV content with these customers have recently [indiscernible] and the outcome of the World Radiocommunication Conference has been positive. In the network services and others, we have also seen a strong performance [indiscernible] with the extension of the complete [ph] network in the Valencia region and the communications network for the rail station in the Barcelona area. As Tobías has stated earlier, we have deployed the Internet of Things network with national companies. We are analyzing the possibility to invest in backhauling for our customers, and we are also looking into the opportunity to start trial in Barcelona in the area of the small cell. [indiscernible] we have done, and we believe we can in the short term, we keep analyzing any single opportunity we can to continue creating value for our shareholders. For example, in the refinancing process [indiscernible] achieve an efficient capital structure to continue capturing new growth opportunities. Another is our efficiency program, [indiscernible] we will go back later. And last but not least, the lean measures we have implemented in order to reshuffle our cash management. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see here the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidating tenancy ratio with the impact of M&A activity explaining the name changes. Despite its effect, we have continued to optimize our network through decommissioning and managed to grow organically by adding tenants in the few countries where we are present. It is very important to emphasize that in the period we have increased the number of PoPs by 8% when compared to December 2014, reflecting the effectiveness of our portfolio for mobile operators. 
On Slide 18, we explain in detail the framework of the Telecom Site Rental Business in terms of revenues. And here, you can see [indiscernible] contribute EUR 8 million to our cost-related figures will as [indiscernible] at EUR 188 million in the same period. 
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA in Slide 19. You can see how the negative impact of the broadcasting business is more than offset by inorganic and organic growth in the telecom segment with the contribution of the organic growth for EUR 6 million in the year. I'm talking about the telecom segment.
Slide 20. We now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 2%. Although this is definitely by the contribution, and Galata had a temporary loss of TV channels. Slide 21. Let me now spend some time explaining our recurring leverage free cash flow generation in detail. I would like to start by highlighting the recurring revenue free cash flow in 2015 have increased 28% when compared to 2014, and that we'll have managed to keep our sound cash conversion ratio at 83% even with temporary negative impact from our broadcasting business. 
Looking to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to the strong organic growth contribution and to recent acquisitions. In the broadcasting business, we have suffered the negative impact of the shutdown of 9 DDT channels which took place in late 2014, but this effect has partially been offset by the simulcast carried out during the first month of 2015. Please take into consideration that this is a one-off effect in the year with its associate revenues not to be seen again in 2015. Network services and other revenues shows a strong increase due to the extension of PPDR contract and [indiscernible] terminals. 
Moving now to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase [indiscernible] is mainly due to costs already associated with our recent project decisions and incremental cost when we have [indiscernible] as a passthrough, therefore [indiscernible] on revenues. As the year progresses, we expect the businesses to start being more and more visible on our figures. On adjusted EBITDA, our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 235 million in line with our guidance and showing a strong 32% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital change remain slightly positive thanks to our strict management, and we expect this to be the trend going forward. When compared to last year, tax paid have decreased mainly because of differentiation of different tax management measures. Maintenance CapEx have been [indiscernible] during the last quarter, breaking normalized level. Decreasing normally [indiscernible] CapEx is mainly explained by the word caveat in the cost base of the simulcast, which also translates into more revenues in the period. Our M&A investment increased due to the [indiscernible]. On shareholder remuneration, our board of directors will propose at the annual shareholder's meeting the distribution of a final dividend of EUR 0.047 per share bringing the total dividend to be distributed against 2015 results to around EUR 20 million is approved [indiscernible] our 20% of our recurring leverage free cash flow for the second half of 2015 as stated in the IPO. 
Slide 22. Moving now to our balance sheet. Cellnex leverage has increased to 3.7x net debt adjusted annualized EBITDA. Below market consensus and also below our long-term average target or forecast. The group has increased the size of the total asset by amount slightly below EUR 1 billion due to the sustaining cost of Galata. Our total equity has remained similar to 2014 with the change mainly due to the net profit in [indiscernible]. Our total work borrowings has increased by EUR 550 million in order to accomplish the already mentioned acquisition and with our balance sheet now reflecting our new capital structure and our bond issued. 
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement. Depreciation and amortization shares [ph] increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. It is worth mentioning that we have annualized the purchase price allocation process of Galata and the figures provided are now being included [indiscernible] D&A going forward. With regard to income tax, it includes the nontax impact in deferred tax due to the change in the Italian tax rate applicable from 2017 onwards. This was attained -- carried out by the Italian government as of December 28, 2015. [indiscernible] net profit [indiscernible] EUR 48 million down when compared to last year due to the combined contribution of the FX, and I will explain. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year, Slide 23. M&A investment has been dedicated in 2015 for the execution of Galata, and 300 towers from Telefonica. Organic expansion CapEx, which is [indiscernible] additional earnings from the asset is deploying with [indiscernible] of low teens unlevered IRR. In [indiscernible], most of this CapEx has been invested in simulcast [indiscernible] of our efficiency plan and the process of [indiscernible] in the context of our IPO. Additionally, our board has provided us with a new capital deployment tool we might use which pertain to asset acquisition, especially in stock. With do these additional levers to make the most of attractive share price and for its future use in corporate transaction thus reducing the size capital increases. 
Going now to Slide 24. As [indiscernible] in our H1 2015 results, there are several cost variance where we see room for improvement and that we constitute the basis of our current efficiency plan. The main contributor to this efficiency plan will be savings from ground leases. [indiscernible] revenue statement [indiscernible] the annual rent being paid and also extended ratio of ground lease contract. Also, advantage we have on a lump sum being paid in advance [indiscernible] lease reduction of the contract. The negative target around 5,000 sites and we believe we can extract savings of around EUR 14 million in 2019 accumulated. But there are also [indiscernible] on where we can entrust additional savings. When it comes to [indiscernible], we will focus on reducing the amount of electricity used as well as electricity fees currently being paid by negotiating with our supplier. In Italia, we are targeting a total of 800 sites with potential of OpEx reduction. We are also upgrading our [indiscernible] activity network in order to make a more efficient use of spectrum [indiscernible] that focus on the redesign of internal processes toward working efficiencies and contract renegotiation of the internal process. 
Slide 25. These first measures have started to implemented in 2015, and we will see the full benefit in 2019, with the aim to improve OpEx market consensus for next year. It is important to highlight that this plan is backloaded with a part of the savings to [indiscernible] mainly in 2018, 2019. CapEx expansion investment will fall into the [indiscernible] category. And as such, it will be deployed at a low teens unlevered IRR. As you can see on the chart, we expect an evolution of OpEx reflecting full year impact [indiscernible] inflation and any incremental OpEx gained to additional organic growth. This efficiency plan started an OpEx reduction of 5% of the 2019 OpEx result initiative. 
Moving to Slide 26. In terms of the financial outlook for 2016, we believe we can provide a recurring levered free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2015 and in line with our market expectations. Looking at the December division [ph] line, it is important to highlight that 88% of our revenues for 2015 are already fully contracted. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow around to the high teen mark and the rest of the line can we project according to our already effective [indiscernible]. A special mention to cash tax [indiscernible] to 2015 this time, a higher income in 2016. Now let me please hand over to Tobías for the final remarks. Thanks, Tobías."

One is [indiscernible], which is the monetization of assets to that one operator maybe, let's say, interested in selling.

So [indiscernible] at least 5% we need maybe for that opportunity of the backhauling or maybe for [indiscernible] tomorrow or maybe for this [indiscernible], but pretty sure that [indiscernible] will bring to you intern opportunity that will be 20% to 25%. Obviously, if we do 5%, the increase in revenue will be smaller than we think that 10% by, kind of, that will how much will be allocated to us, not only these opportunity backhauling, but we are working on smart cell, we are working [indiscernible] 5%, 10% as long as we get [indiscernible] we will not do it.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so very much for your time today and please allow me to start by highlighting that we are very proud to present again a solid set of results, with all of our projects progressing steadily and our core activities delivering a continued strong organic growth with sustained demand seen for our portfolio of assets and services. 
If we move to Slide #4, I would like to start by highlighting that 2015 has been a year of deliveries. We have met the guidance we shared with you, and we have done so supporting our activity in our 3 strategic pillars. The first one is the organic growth. Organic growth means maximization of our existing portfolio to capture new revenues while efficiently managing our cost structure, hence delivering an attractive operating leverage. The second one is to keep a robust balance sheet with flexible access to debt and capital markets. The objective is to have a stable long-term balance sheet and a competitive cost, while retaining the financing flexibility required to capture new growth opportunities. And the third one, we are willing to play a key role in the consolidation of the tower landscape in Europe. In this sense, I would like to emphasize that our geographical focus is Europe. But our [indiscernible] have been better than nature allows us to reaching a long-term partner for our customers. And that's the only reason why we will execute a transaction is because we will create value for our stockholders. And to ensure this is the case, we have a strict investment discipline. 
We move to Slide #5. We can approach the specific examples that illustrate our strategic pillars. Organic growth in the Telecom Site Rental business has been strong in 2015 with an increase of PoPs of 8% mainly due to our multi-tenancy services. That means more customers on our towers because they require additional locations mainly for a 4G rollout. Reduction of coverage gaps and higher densification mainly in the urban areas. It is also important to mention that after just 9 months of operations in Italy, the company that runs the towers we acquired from WIND in Italy, we have managed it to increase our tenancy ratio in the country. Thus, meeting our acquisition business plan so far. I think this is a very good news for everyone. 
Looking into 2016 onwards, we believe the main driver for organic growth will be the rationalization of our rapid [ph] networks. And in order to capture this growth, we have today identified around 2,000 towers that can be dismantled in the 2 countries we are present. We are actively and constantly working with different operators and we expect to present to you good news on this front in the very short term. The economical benefits of this new activity should start being visible from 2016, 2017. Moving to Slide #6. Here, you can see the main characteristics of our current debt structure. As a result of the refinancing process we carried out last year, we have managed to extend our maturities at a competitive cost, removed any additional covenants which might constrain our future growth, partially hedge our interest rates and diversify our sources of funds. This creates the appropriate platform to continue pursuing and manage projects, which are analyzed under strict value-creation criteria with a view to maximize levered free cash flow per share, while minimizing the need for capital increases. With this capital structure in place, we will face no refinancing risk for the next 6 years as the first maturity in 2020 can be easily repaid with the cash generated by the group during this period. Our leverage stands today at EUR 927 million with the leverage ratio of 3.7x net debt EBITDA. 
Moving to Slide #7. This is just to remind you of the excellent M&A execution we have carried out during the last 4 years with an average acquisition of 3,000 towers per year and which has allowed us to grow at the low mid-teens CAGR in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring levered free cash flow. And what's the next? Our first priority is to consolidate our presence in Spain and in Italy, and then we want to continue pursuing new projects in the main European countries like U.K., France and Germany. And these countries offer very attractive market dynamics and interesting opportunities that we are currently assessing. I would now like to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO, who will provide you more details on this front."

And this is again to remind you that we have met the guidance we shared with you back in August and that is -- constitutes an excellent starting point to meet 2016 market expectations. We have posted an adjusted EBITDA in line with market expectations, maintenance CapEx has been slightly below, working capital change is slightly positive thanks to our proactive management, interest payments have been very well contained and cash tax has been in line with what we anticipated. All this leads to a net debt position as of end of the year below market expectations. 
If we move to Slide #10, this strong delivery has also been recognized by the market during 2015, with Cellnex share price up to 23% when compared to our IPO price of EUR 14 per share and a 38% outperformance when compared to the IBEX index. Our share price has recently experienced a high degree of volatility, but our fundamentals remain equally strong and market estimates have been maintained, providing a target price of around EUR 18 per share with an upside potential of 27%. 
Moving to Slide #11. It is important to make emphasis again on our ability to extend the array of services we can provide over our current asset base and with our available resources. As already discussed, 2015 has been a year when multi-tenancy has provide us with a very strong organic growth and 2016 will be a year when rationalization projects will play a key role. But we are also actively monitoring and analyzing new potential business lines, which may provide us with future revenue streams. Built to suit is an area where we will use an opportunistic approach. Today, we already have an agreement with WIND in Italy to build 400 towers over 6 years. In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Securitas Direct for the deployment of the first global IoT network with national coverage in Spain. We are now looking at expanding this network by adding new locations. A field where we also see an opportunity is backhauling, which consists of acquiring the right of use of existing fiber-to-the-tower or the deployment of new fiber where such an alternative is not available. This will represent a way to increase the effectiveness of our portfolio, as we will be able to offer high-speed connectivity, thus avoiding future capacity bottlenecks if the data demand continues rising at the current rates. And the economics are similar to our core business. CapEx is deployed on an infrastructure that can be shared across multiple customers in exchange for a long-term contract. We are outsourcing potential revenues from what we call managed services. Advisory services for operators in noncore countries in order to help them with tower outsourcing processes. These services may include assistance during the preacquisition stage of towers supporting the transfer of assets to the new TowerCo as well as supporting further M&A plans. It is worth mentioning that these partnerships involve no equity contribution by Cellnex.
In addition to our traditional macro tower business, we are also assessing the potential to increase our presence in the small cell area. We currently have a 8-year contract with the Barcelona municipality by which we can sell co-location services for small cells placed through the city. In this regard, and leveraging on this contract, we are pleased to announce to you that we have just reached an agreement with Orange to deploy the first small cell network in Barcelona, with the potential to add more operators in the future into this network. 
If we move to Slide #12, we describe our experience in the areas of the small cells, IoT and Smart Cities. As I have just mentioned, we already have a contract with the municipality of Barcelona, which grants us access to urban infrastructure and public locations in order to serve co-location services for the small cells. Such agreements are of key importance of having access to premium locations in urban areas, and is the key differentiating factor when deploying a small cell network. Today, we are analyzing the possibility with different MNOs to initiate some pilot projects with the objective to shape the business model, find the most feasible locations and provide high-capacity connectivity in areas of strong data demand. I just mentioned it, we have just reached an agreement with Orange for the deployment of the first small cell network in Barcelona. 
In the area of the Internet of Things, we have deployed a national coverage network based on Sigfox technology for our customer security [ph] [indiscernible]. To date, we provide the network infrastructure, backhaul connectivity and network maintenance, but we are also analyzing the possibility to expand our presence in other areas of the value chain. 
Finally, in the area of Smart Cities, we currently manage and maintain the WiFi network of the city of Barcelona, allowing us to offer innovative services to third party over this network such as WiFi mesh, it means active interconnection of access points or platform -- has a platform of offload, I mean mobile data download over WiFi networks. 
Moving to Slide #13. Let me now please in this section reminding our main highlight for 2015. We are now a public company after a very successful IPO with the market supporting our equity story based on becoming the tower consolidator in Europe. We have managed to show a continued strong performance in the Telecom Site Rental business, based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions, while setting the foundations for future organic opportunities. By the end of 2015, we held the position #25 in terms of market capitalization of the Spanish companies. The 20th of July we successfully complete our inaugural debt capital markets transaction with a EUR 600 million bond with a 7-year maturity and a coupon of 3.125%. The bond was 6x oversubscribed and has no covenants, allowing for future growth. We carried out a transformational deal less than 1 year ago by acquiring 7,377 towers from WIND in Italy. The integration process of this new company is on track, and we are extremely pleased with its performance, better than anticipated. We have started implementing the first stage of our efficiency program. We have paid our first dividend. The national MUX retendering process has been complete, and we are now working with our [indiscernible] customers in order to accelerate the future [ph]. Additionally, the 700 megahertz band has been allocated through TV use at least until 2026. Finally, 6 months ago, we shared our guidance with you that we have met which proved our focus on delivery. Now please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, who will explain you in detail our 2015 business and financial performance. Please, Jose Manuel."

So regarding the 2015 business performance, let me start by highlighting that we have met the guidance we shared with you 2 quarters ago and that we have managed to meet this guidance mainly because of the strong organic growth in 2015",1943,"Thank you, Tobías. So regarding the 2015 business performance, let me start by highlighting that we have met the guidance we shared with you 2 quarters ago and that we have managed to meet this guidance mainly because of the strong organic growth in 2015, leading, at the same time, to a cash conversion ratio of 83%. 
Moving to the next slide, 16. In terms facility, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 8% compared to December 2015 [ph] as to our guidance for the rollout, the reduction of coverage gaps and higher network densification needs. In 2015, we have doubled the size of our tower portfolio by acquiring 300 towers from Telefonica [indiscernible] 2015 and 7,677 towers from WIND back in March. It is worth mentioning that the integration process of each  company [ph] is on track and in less than 1 year of operations, we are proud of its performance, even better than we anticipated at the time of the acquisition. 
We are also paving the way for future organic growth by actively pursuing rationalization projects with mobile operators looking for a reduction of the cost spend and maintain assets. In Italia, we see a scope of around 2,000 towers to decommission and by working intensely to announce an agreement. This strong performance of our telecom severance agreement more than offset the temporary impact from the shutdown of TV channels back in 2013, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels this year. In this regard, we can confirm that the tendering process of 6 new TV channels has been completed and that we have signed contracts with all of the groups that have been awarded [indiscernible]. We are now working closely with our customers in order to help them switch on [indiscernible] content as soon as possible, and they are all now broadcasting in [indiscernible]. Additionally, the risk of loss of 8 TV channels was completely removed. All national DDT content with these customers has recently been renewed and the outcome of the World Radiocommunication Conference has been positive. In the network services and other areas, we have also seen a strong performance [indiscernible] with the extension of the complete [ph] network in the Valencia region and the communications network for the rail station in the Barcelona area. As Tobías has stated earlier, we have deployed the Internet of Things network with national coverage [ph]. We are analyzing the possibility to invest in backhauling for our customers, and we are also looking into the possibility to start trials in Barcelona in the area of the small cell. [indiscernible] we have done, and where we believe we can assist in the short term, we keep analyzing any single opportunity we can find to continue creating value for our shareholders. For example, in the refinancing process [indiscernible] achieve an efficient capital structure to continue capturing new growth opportunities. Another is our efficiency program, details of which we will cover later. And last but not least, the lean [ph] measures we have implemented in order to reshuffle our tax management. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see here the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidating tenancy ratio with the impact of M&A activity explaining the name changes. Despite its effect, we have continued to optimize our network through decommissioning and managed to grow organically by adding tenants in the few countries where we are present. It is very important to emphasize that in the period we have increased the number of PoPs by 8% when compared to December 2014, reflecting the effectiveness of our portfolio for mobile operators. 
On Slide 18, we explain in detail the framework of the Telecom Site Rental Business in terms of revenues. And here, you can see [indiscernible] contribute EUR 8 million to our cost-related figures will as [indiscernible] at EUR 188 million in the same period. 
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA in Slide 19. You can see how the negative impact of the broadcasting business is more than offset by inorganic and organic growth in the Telecom Site Rental business with the contribution of the organic growth for EUR 6 million in the year. I'm talking about the telecom segment.
Slide 20. We now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution, operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 2%. Although this is diluted by the contribution and Galata had a temporary loss of TV channels. Slide 21. Let me now spend some time explaining our recurring levered free cash flow generation in detail. I would like to start by highlighting the recurring levered free cash flow in 2015 has increased 28% when compared to 2014, and that we have managed to keep our sound cash conversion ratio at 83% even with temporary negative impact from our broadcasting business. 
Looking to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to the strong organic growth contribution and to recent acquisitions. In the broadcasting business, we have suffered the negative impact of the shutdown of 9 DDT channels which took place in late 2014, but this effect has partially been offset by the simulcast carried out during the first month of 2015. Please take into consideration that this is a one-off effect in the year with its associated revenues not to be seen again in 2016. Network services and other revenues show a strong increase due to the extension of PPDR contract and [indiscernible] terminals. 
Moving now to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase [indiscernible] is mainly due to costs already associated with our recent project decisions and incremental cost when we have [indiscernible] as a pass-through, therefore [indiscernible] on revenues. As the year progresses, we expect efficiencies to start being more and more visible in our figures. On adjusted EBITDA, our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 235 million in line with our guidance and showing a strong 32% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital change remains slightly positive thanks to our strict management, and we expect this to be the trend going forward. When compared to last year, tax paid has decreased mainly because of implementation of different tax management measures. Maintenance CapEx have been [indiscernible] during the last quarter, reaching normalized level. Decreasing normalized [indiscernible] CapEx is mainly explained by the work carried out in the cost base of the simulcast, which also translates into more revenues in the period. Our M&A investment increased due to the [indiscernible]. On shareholder remuneration, our Board of Directors will propose at the annual shareholder's meeting the distribution of a final dividend of EUR 0.047 per share bringing the total dividend to be distributed against 2015 results to around EUR 20 million if approved, or in other words, 20% of our recurring levered free cash flow for the second half of 2015 as stated in the IPO. 
Slide 22. Moving now to our balance sheet. Cellnex leverage has increased to 3.7x net debt adjusted annualized EBITDA. Below market consensus and also below our long-term average target or forecast. The group has increased the size of its total assets by amount slightly below EUR 1 billion due to the sustaining [ph] cost of Galata. Our total equity has remained similar to 2014 with the change mainly due to the net profit generated in the year. Our total work borrowings has increased by EUR 550 million in order to accomplish the already mentioned acquisition and with our balance sheet now reflecting our new capital structure and our bond issued. 
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement. Depreciation and amortization shares [ph] increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. It is worth mentioning that we have annualized the purchase price allocation process of Galata and the figures provided are now being included [indiscernible] D&A going forward. With regard to income tax, it includes the nontax impact in deferred tax due to the change in the Italian tax rate applicable from 2017 onwards. This was attained -- carried out by the Italian government as of December 28, 2015. Cellnex net profit reached EUR 48 million down when compared to last year due to the combined contribution of the FX, and I will explain. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year, Slide 23. M&A investment has been dedicated in 2015 for the execution of Galata, and 300 towers from Telefonica. Organic expansion CapEx, which is [indiscernible] additional earnings from the asset is deploying with [indiscernible] of low teens unlevered IRR. In [indiscernible], most of this CapEx has been invested in simulcast [indiscernible] of our efficiency plan and the process of [indiscernible] in the context of our IPO. Additionally, our board has provided us with a new capital deployment tool we might use, with the potential acquisition, especially in stock. We will use these additional levers to make the most of attractive share price and for its future use in corporate transaction, thus reducing the size capital increases. 
Going now to Slide 24. As [indiscernible] in our H1 2015 results, there are several cost areas where we see room for improvement and that will constitute the basis of our current efficiency plan. The main contributor to this efficiency plan will be savings from ground leases. [indiscernible] revenue statement [indiscernible] the annual rent being paid and also extended duration of ground lease contract. Also, advantage we have on a lump sum being paid in advance in exchange for a lease reduction [indiscernible] of the contract. The negative [ph] target around 5,000 sites and we believe we can extract savings of around EUR 14 million in 2019 accumulated. But there are also other ideas on where we can extract additional savings. When it comes to energy, we will focus on reducing the amount of electricity used as well as electricity fees currently being paid by negotiating with our supplier. In Italia, we are targeting a total of 800 sites with potential of OpEx reduction. We are also upgrading our [indiscernible] activity network in order to make a more efficient use of spectrum [indiscernible] that focus on the redesign of internal processes toward working efficiencies and contract renegotiation to meet our targets. 
Slide 25. These first measures have started to be implemented in 2015, and we will see the full benefit in 2019, with the aim to improve OpEx market consensus for that year. It is important to highlight that this plan is back-loaded with a part of the savings to be seen mainly in 2018, 2019. CapEx expansion investment will fall into the [indiscernible] category. And as such, it will be deployed at a low teens unlevered IRR. As you can see on the chart, we expect an evolution of OpEx reflecting full year impact [indiscernible] inflation and any incremental OpEx linked to additional organic growth. This efficiency plan started an OpEx reduction of 5% of the 2019 OpEx result initiative. 
Moving to Slide 26. In terms of the financial outlook for 2016, we believe we can provide a recurring levered free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2015 and in line with the market expectations. Looking at the December division [ph] line, it is important to highlight that 88% of our revenues for 2015 are already fully contracted. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow around to the high teen mark and the rest of the line can we project according to our already effective [indiscernible]. A special mention to cash tax [indiscernible] to 2015 this time, a higher income in 2016. Now let me please hand over to Tobías for the final remarks. Thanks, Tobías."

We are in advanced discussions here. We have several versions ongoing and in -- not only in Spain but also in Italy. And as you know, we are approaching to 2 types of business models. One is [indiscernible], which is the monetization of assets, that one operator may be, let's say, interested in selling. The other one is more on the rationalization and this aspect that takes some time on finding [indiscernible], so we need to go into the detailed analysis of side-by-side, taking the decision which 1 of the 2 potential sites to be decommissioned is going to survive at the end. [indiscernible] to do an analysis in relation to not only the cost of the lease but also for instance the fiber access.

And also on top of that, in the current market and talking about bonds -- say talking about debt market, we're going to be consistent with our long term 4x net debt-to-EBITDA as we have explained, happy to go to a peak that could be maybe 6.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, but always being commensurate with the current market situation.

Just wanted to check that you would not be willing to go down for a 30% stake. You have said I think on the commentary you'd make a mandatory offer if your bid was successful. And I just wanted to check if there is any flexibility on that from your perspective. And secondly, just regarding M&A in other countries, following on from Emmet's previous question. You've got quite a wide range of countries you are now interested in across Europe. Firstly, I would presume we would only see you move in those countries if the Inwit bid is unsuccessful. And secondly, which countries do you think are most appealing to you? When you're looking at these countries, what is it in particular that you would be most interested in looking for?"

So I have a number of follow-up questions. The first is on the backhauling. Looking at the backhauling, it looks like the business model is rather different from the one that you've done in the past, and in the past situation you bought towers and then you leased space. Here you are to build. And so my question is that you mentioned EUR 20 million opportunistic CapEx. How much more on the expansion CapEx you've released today, or otherwise [ph] 10% of revenues, would be backhauling? And secondly, if it's all from the revenue model, how it works in the backhauling, how you're going to charge for it? And will there be any synergy with the core business? I believe that towers will provide the backhauling, probably you can extract more in terms of rental? The second question is on the broadcasting. Broadcasting revenues are down around EUR 25 million. EUR 15 million are basically one-offs. The question is, what's the rest, and how are we to think about that going forward into 2016? And the third is on the dynamics of any potential rights issue for the transaction with Inwit. More precisely, you basically stressed that you want to keep flexibility, you don't know what the markets will look like if the transaction completes, if there is transaction anyway, but then you will support 6.5x as your peak for net debt-to-EBITDA. It's a bit difficult to imagine that you can do with 6.5x the entire transaction. Therefore, how you're going to basically take the flexibility in the rights issue if you can -- if you basically stop your game after the 6.5x, what else you can do?"

Obviously, did you ask now -- what percentage of the 5%, 10% guidelines if we have to obtain from this initiative. To be honest, right now, I don't know. What we do know is that what will happen this year. This year we have invested EUR 30 million of expansion CapEx, which is percent by percent. Most of it has come from the simulcast, okay. So [indiscernible] at least 5% we need maybe for that opportunity of the backhauling or maybe for a simulcast tomorrow or maybe for this [indiscernible], but rest assured that step by step we will bring to you, this is an opportunity that will be [indiscernible] or 10%. Obviously, if we do 5%, the increase in revenue will be smaller than if we invest 10%. But I cannot tell you how much will be allocated -- not only this opportunity, backhauling, but also we are working on small cells, we are working on smart cities [indiscernible] 5%, 10% as long as we get [indiscernible]. Otherwise, we will not do it. Obviously, in these type questions you would ask [indiscernible] I think if there was some kind of economics of scale, what we took advantage is what the concept -- took advantage of something more, of course. I mean, we operate that backhauling is because we retain that in that tower, there will be [indiscernible] another financial model and maybe another one much later. So for us, at the end of the day, backhauling is another sharing experience [ph]. The tower is a sharing opportunity. So backhauling is again a sharing opportunity around larger contracts that has to be run batch by batch. We cannot give you [indiscernible]. I can't, I wish I could, but I can't. Your second question was about EUR 25 million, half of which is simulcast [ph] more or less what's coming from simulcast, I thought you said. And the other half is coming from what? Okay, I think that it is true that the simulcast is what you said, something one-off. But at the same time, you have to take into account that expansion CapEx will allow us to have this kind of one-offs in a regular basis [ph], as we were saying before, but on top of that, another half of this EUR 25 million, higher I think you said, is [indiscernible] I mean, you have EUR 8 million [indiscernible] presentation, and the rest -- so the rest is [indiscernible] efficiency, more or less this is [indiscernible]. The thing is, at the end of the day, that the company is performing well, performing very well. I think that indeed in 2016 we will be able to deliver what we are committing again. [indiscernible] As you know, we're a prudent company. We are a prudent management team, and we try to give something that we are able to deliver step-by-step. So you have [indiscernible] but you have to take into account. And also regarding the rights issue, you are right. If we go to the 6.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, we cannot [indiscernible]. However, as I explained before, [indiscernible] is not only to go to 6.5x net debt-to-EBITDA. This is opportunity, but also to be commensurate in the market situation with the bond market, with the debt market, we have to be coherent. Because as you know, the market is important, but as you said, the opportunities in the pipeline is important. So rest assured that if we go to the market, at some point, we have rights issues because [indiscernible] coherence framework, not only because we have done Inwit or if not or is a coherent thing, okay. And with net debt-to-EBITDA perspective will make sense, and from a recurring levered free cash flow per share, I can assure you will be accretive. Which at the end of the day is what we think our shareholders are asking for."

And then you can somehow get back, let's say, the corporate tax income of the company multiplied by the goodwill for 5 years [indiscernible] divided by 5 for 5 years. So this is something that can take place as long as there is a measure and as long as this goodwill counts as in the balance sheet of the company.

Thank you so much for your time today, and please allow me to start by highlighting the main managed terms of the period. So Page 4 of the presentation. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that confirm our cash flow visibility. Our recurring level of free cash flow for the period has been slightly above the market expectations. We continue to be in a privileged position to capture future organic growth opportunities. We are the natural candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. Also, all uncertainties around the broadcasting business have been completely removed. And finally, we are now -- we are glad to announce that our bond is now eligible for the European Central Bank purchase program of corporate bonds. 
Moving now to the next slide. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 1% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way for future organic growth by signing contracts in the small cell areas and distributed antenna systems in tunnels. We are also analyzing new tasks and projects to reinstall and shopping centers and car parks. We continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators and we are working hard to announce an agreement in the short term. We are also assessing the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and this analyzes is showing a very good progress. Finally, we are constantly engaging in conversations with other clients to assess the potential to improve their coverage, which have resulted in new framework agreement signed. 
In the broadcasting area, we can confirm that all uncertainties have been completely removed, that the retendering process of 6 new TV channels have been successfully completed with all our channels today broadcasting, thus, providing a stable revenue platform going forward. 
In the network services and other areas, we have also seen a strong network, a strong performance, thanks to the connectivity business. We have also managed to extend our IoT network in Spain with around 170 [ph] additional sites. And we have won several PPDR contracts for transport and utilities applications. 
In the smart cities area, we have submitted 2 [ph] proposals in the context of the binding procedures opened by the Spanish government. On top of this, we keep analyzing opportunities to continue creating value for our shareholders, and one example is our efficiency program. In this context, we are making good progress on the ground lease front by approaching our landlords with proposals to renegotiate terms and cash advance. 
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio with the impact of organic growth explaining the changes. We have managed to add more than 200 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.54. On the next chart, we explain in detail the performance of the Telecom Site Rental business in terms of revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contribute EUR 2 million to our consolidated figures while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in the period. 
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA. You can see the negative impact of DTT simulcast, which was a one-off positive effect last year, and this impact is more than offset by the contribution of organic and inorganic growth. Also the positive contribution of organic growth of EUR 2.5 million in this quarter. 
Let me now explain in detail our recurring leverage of free cash flow generation in the quarter. Slide 7. I would like to start by highlighting the recurring level of free cash flow in the period has increased 14%. 
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to a strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business is no longer reflecting the simulcast carryout in 2015, and network services and others show a strong increased mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business. 
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. Increase shown is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which is EUR 63.5 million, in line with our full year guidance and showing a strong 26% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital change remains positive, thanks to our strict management, although we expect this to be neutral at year-end in line with our full year guidance. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with a first coupon associated with our bond due in July. And tax paid, reflecting implementation of tax management measures as well as the tax regular payment schedule. 
Maintenance CapEx will be catching up during the year to reach normalized levels in line with our guidance. Our non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 6 million associated with cash advances. As a result, you can see that our recurring level of free cash flow represents EUR 66 million  [ph] million compared to our adjusted EBITDA of EUR 63 [ph] million, which means a conversion ratio of more than 100%. 
Moving now to Slide #8. Our balance sheet and concerning our leverage, we can say that it has decreased to 3.6x in terms of net debt and annualized EBITDA, which is below our long-term leverage ratio of 4x net debt-to-EBITDA. Our total net debt, as you can see in this slide, is EUR 901 million with our bond accounting for most of the debt. When assessing the change in the net debt, it needs to be taken into account that in January, we paid the second tranche of the last towers acquired from Telefonica back in January 2015. 
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization changes, these increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. Finally, Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 11 million with increased revenues partly offset by depreciation change. 
Moving to Slide 9. The assumptions behind our financial outlook for the full year 2015 are still valid. We believe that we can provide a recurring level of free cash flow that will exceed 10% higher than in 2015, which is in line with market expectations. Looking at the different contribution lines, also the same assumptions apply for each of them, confirming the high visibility of our business. 
Finally, Slide 10 and 11, these 2 slides will be taken together. So let me finish the presentation by saying with you why we believe Cellnex is an attractive investment opportunity. From the current operational perspective, Cellnex is a company with solid fundamentals that provides cash flow visibility inorganic growth option ability, leveraging our future revenues streams. But also, on the Slide 11, we can see that, thanks to our flexible balance sheet, a strict investment criteria and independency of our neutral operator like Cellnex, we are in a privileged position to consolidate the European tower landscape. It is also important to highlight the current low interest rate environment as a consequence of the recent purchase programs announced by the European Central Bank, from which we can benefit by obtaining very attractive financial rates for future expansion. So in a nutshell, Cellnex today is a combination of strong generator of visible cash flows. We -- I would say, optionability in terms of M&A and organic growth. Everything together, I would say, an attractive valuation as of today."

I am not the best positioned person to answer this question, but I assume that as in many other company, when there is a change of CEO, the new CEO wants to take a little bit of time to rethink everything, to reassess different ways, different mechanisms or maybe the next steps or just to go into details, which is the most useful thing that can happen in this kind of big, big companies of EUR 14 billion, EUR 15 billion market cap. So I would say at the end of the day, the logic will prevail and I am pretty sure that rationale decision-makers in previous and current management will make a decision that increase the share value of the shareholders of Telecom Italia.

Thank you so much for your time today. And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones for the period, so Page 4 of the presentation. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that confirm our cash flow visibil",1235,"Good afternoon. Thank you so much for your time today. And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones for the period, so Page 4 of the presentation. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that confirm our cash flow visibility. Our recurring leveled free cash flow for the period has been slightly above the market expectations. We continue to be in a privileged position to capture future organic growth opportunities. We are the natural candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. Also, all uncertainties around the broadcasting business have been completely removed. And finally, we are glad to announce that our bond is now eligible for the European Central Bank purchase program of corporate bonds.
Moving now to the next slide. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 1% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way for future organic growth by signing contracts in the small cell areas and distributed antenna systems in tunnels. We are also analyzing new DAS projects to be installed in shopping centers and car parks. We continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to announce an agreement in the short term. We are also assessing the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and this analysis is showing a very good progress. Finally, we are constantly engaging in conversations with other clients to assess the potential to improve their coverage, which have resulted in new framework agreement signed.
In the broadcasting area, we can confirm that all uncertainties have been completely removed, that the retendering process of 6 new TV channels have been successfully completed with all our channels today broadcasting, thus, providing a stable revenue platform going forward. 
In the network services and other areas, we have also seen a strong network -- a strong performance, thanks to the connectivity business. We have also managed to extend our IoT network in Spain with around 170 additional sites. And we have won several PPDR contracts for transport and utilities applications. In the Smart Cities area, we have submitted 2 proposals in the context of the binding procedures opened by the Spanish government. 
On top of this, we keep analyzing opportunities to continue creating value for our shareholders, and one example is our efficiency program. In this context, we are making good progress on the ground lease front by approaching our landlords with proposals to renegotiate terms and cash advance.
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with the impact of organic growth explaining the changes. We have managed to add more than 200 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.54. On the next chart, we explain in detail the performance of the Telecom Site Rental business in terms of revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contribute EUR 2 million to our consolidated figures while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in the period.
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA. You can see the negative impact of DTT simulcast, which was a one-off positive effect last year. And this impact is more than offset by the contribution of an organic and inorganic growth, with also the positive contribution of organic growth of EUR 2.5 million in this quarter.
Let me now explain in detail our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the quarter. Slide 7. I would like to start by highlighting that the recurring leveled free cash flow in the period has increased 14%. 
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to a strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business is no longer reflecting the simulcast carryout in 2015, and network services and others show a strong increased mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business. 
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase shown is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reaches EUR 63.5 million, in line with our full year guidance and showing a strong 26% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital change remains positive, thanks to our strict management. Although we expect this to be neutral at the year-end, in line with our full year guidance. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond due in July. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measures as well as the tax regular payment schedule.
Maintenance CapEx will be catching up during the year to reach normalized levels, in line with our guidance. Our non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 6 million associated with cash advances. As a result, you can see that our recurring leveled free cash flow represents EUR 66 million compared to our adjusted EBITDA of EUR 63 million, which means a conversion ratio of more than 100%.
Moving now to Slide #8. Our balance sheet and concerning our leverage, we can say that it has decreased to 3.6x in terms of net debt annualized EBITDA, which is below our long-term leverage target ratio of 4x net debt-to-EBITDA. Our total net debt, as you can see in this slide, is EUR 901 million with our bond accounting for most of the debt. When assessing the change in the net debt, it needs to be taken into account that, in January, we paid the second tranche of the last towers acquired from Telefonica back in January 2015.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization changes, these increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. Finally, Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 11 million, with increased revenues partly offset by depreciation change.
Moving to Slide 9. The assumptions behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We believe that we can provide a recurring leveled free cash flow that will exceed 10% higher than in 2015, which is in line with market expectations. Looking at the different contribution lines, also the same assumptions apply for each of them, confirming the high visibility of our business.
Finally, Slide 10 and 11, these 2 slides will be taken together. So let me finish the presentation by saying with you why we believe Cellnex is an attractive investment opportunity. From the current operational perspective, Cellnex is a company with solid fundamentals that provides cash flow visibility and organic growth option ability, leveraging our future revenues streams. But also, on the Slide 11, we can see that thanks to our flexible balance sheet, a strict investment criteria and independency of our neutral operator like Cellnex, we are in a privileged position to consolidate the European tower landscape. It is also important to highlight the current low interest rate environments as a consequence of the recent purchase programs announced by the European Central Bank, from which we can benefit by obtaining very attractive financial rates for future expansion. 
So in a nutshell, Cellnex today is a combination of a strong generator of visible cash flows. We -- I would say, optionability in terms of M&A and organic growth. Everything together, I would say, an attractive valuation as of today."

The cash advance, as you know, we launched through our efficiency program, and that was announced in 2015 results. And I think that the program is working very well, and all the investments in this EUR 6 million of cash advance that we have executed in this term are following the main criteria that we have, which is broadly speaking, at least an unlevered IRR of low double-digit. Let me be cautious in this topic because we are in the middle of conversations with several landlords in both countries and we have to be here and very prudent. But it is working well. It is working attractive paybacks, and I think it's a measure that has an important impact or one of the most important cost lines of our company. Regarding the framework agreements, as you can read in Page #5 of our presentation, we are working with different MNOs in framework agreements. 
And broadly speaking next to coverage stations -- extensions in both countries, in Spain and also in Italy. At the end of the day, it seems that the rollout of 4G requires tower, requires good positioning. And these new framework agreements that we tried to also keep the name of the client and the country for us, let me say that will come up as PoPs, organic PoPs, in the next quarters. And we are very happy with this 1% growth of PoPs in this quarter, and we think that this is a good trend that will be supported by these agreements. 
And also I think this question about [indiscernible] position, we need to answer."

I think selling towers is something that right now we do not consider. I think that we have a portfolio that we have to expand, and it makes more sense to compete and to facilitate the country in Italy rather than selling it down. I think that the Italian towers have value. They belong to a network that cover the whole country. And if we can somehow be competitive in the Inwit process it's because we have a very good positioning in the country. If we lose this positioning we are -- maybe we are making money in the short term, but in the long term, we are losing value. So no -- so far, it's not been the best-case scenario. Regarding the tenancy ratio, which is your first question, I will say to you that we have been quiet in -- maybe on other occasions. The organic growth we saw last year, 8%, is very high. I would say that, in a normal scenario, between 3% or 4% growth in number of PoPs makes sense. And then this will drive up our tenancy ratio [indiscernible]. We do think also that on top of this, we may have the decommissioning effect, and this could somehow increase further our tenancy ratio.

And we are opening the market, and then everyone in our clients would like to have a view on the deal and to have their own point of view. We fully respect and we thank the opportunity that our client give us in order to this -- to do this rationalization project. And at the same time, we have to follow their own concerns and their own decision-making process, which is not -- many times, it takes time, and this is not something customary that you do it from one day to the other. So this is your third question. The first question, you were talking about Yoigo. Yoigo, you know that it is truly -- they have very ambitious plan of coverage in 4G in Spain. Obviously, we have a close relationship with Yoigo. And I think that somehow we should be well positioned to capture part of the growth coming from this and other clients that have to extend their coverage. And finally, the build-to-suit in Italy, you are right. Somehow we are now localizing, so assessing different locations in order to build out the towers. And I think in the next couple of quarters, you will see that these 400 towers step by step are coming. And Fernando, this is something clear, the company is running well.

And given that you've had a little bit of feedback, I think is what you said at the start of the call, on the bidding process, does that change of management -- and obviously, the influence within the shareholder base, does that change the objective of Telecom Italia with respect to the ownership of Inwit? And does it change the framework of the bids from their perspective? Are they looking for different aspects within a bid from before? If you could share something on that, that'd be really great. And just also a smaller additional question. Is there any update on your backhauling of sites, so the fiber backhauling? I was kind of -- have you had much interaction with MNOs on that yet?"

And this is also interesting organic growth line that, at some point, we should present to you. It will take a little bit more time, but we are happy with the progress. So yes, let's leave it there. Regarding the Inwit and Telecom Italia new management, well, listen, this is -- I am not the best-positioned person to answer this question. But I assume that as in any other company, when there is a change of CEO, the new CEO wants to take a little bit of time to rethink everything, to reassess different ways, different mechanisms or maybe the next steps or just to go into details, which is the most useful thing that can happen in this kind of big, big companies of EUR 14 billion, EUR 15 billion market cap. So I'm pretty sure that at the end of the day, logic will prevail. And I'm pretty sure that rational decision-makers in previous and current management will make decisions that increase the share value of all the shareholders of Telecom Italia. From this angle and this professional angle, I am pretty sure that Cellnex is best positioned to offer the best offer not only for Telecom Italia but also for every single minority in Inwit that would like to have the same opportunities. And this is the Cellnex offer: open, clear. And I will say to you that challenging -- in terms of price, in terms of contract, in terms of it -- it's good for everyone. It's a win-win agreement for everyone."

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones for the period, so Page 4 of the presentation. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that confirm our cash flow visibility. Our recurring levered free cash flow for the period has been slightly above the market expectations. We continue to be in a privileged position to capture future organic growth opportunities. We are the natural candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. Also, all uncertainties around the broadcasting business have been completely removed. And finally, we are glad to announce that our bond is now eligible for the European Central Bank purchase program of corporate bonds.
Moving now to the next slide. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 1% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way for future organic growth by signing contracts in the small cell areas and distributed antenna systems in tunnels. We are also analyzing new DAS projects to be installed in shopping centers and car parks. We continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to announce an agreement in the short term. We are also assessing the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and this analysis is showing a very good progress. Finally, we are constantly engaging in conversations with other clients to assess the potential to improve their coverage, which have resulted in new framework agreement signed.
In the broadcasting area, we can confirm that all uncertainties have been completely removed, that the retendering process of 6 new TV channels have been successfully completed with all channels today broadcasting, thus, providing a stable revenue platform going forward. 
In the network services and other areas, we have also seen a strong network -- a strong performance, thanks to the connectivity business. We have also managed to extend our IoT network in Spain with around 170 additional sites. And we have won several PPDR contracts for transport and utilities applications. In the Smart Cities area, we have submitted 2 proposals in the context of the binding procedures opened by the Spanish government. 
On top of this, we keep analyzing opportunities to continue creating value for our shareholders, and one example is our efficiency program. In this context, we are making good progress on the ground lease front by approaching our landlords with proposals to renegotiate terms and cash advance.
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with the impact of organic growth explaining the changes. We have managed to add more than 200 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.54. On the next chart, we explain in detail the performance of the Telecom Site Rental business in terms of revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contribute EUR 2 million to our consolidated figures while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in the period.
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA. You can see the negative impact of DTT simulcast, which was a one-off positive effect last year. And this impact is more than offset by the contribution of an organic and inorganic growth, with also the positive contribution of organic growth of EUR 2.5 million in this quarter.
Let me now explain in detail our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the quarter. Slide 7. I would like to start by highlighting that the recurring levered free cash flow in the period has increased 14%. 
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increase is mainly due to a strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business is no longer reflecting the simulcast carryout in 2015, and network services and others show a strong increase mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business. 
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase shown is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reaches EUR 63.5 million, in line with our full year guidance and showing a strong 26% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital change remains positive, thanks to our strict management. Although we expect this to be neutral at the year-end, in line with our full year guidance. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond due in July. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measures as well as the tax regular payment schedule.
Maintenance CapEx will be catching up during the year to reach normalized levels, in line with our guidance. Our non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 6 million associated with cash advances. As a result, you can see that our recurring levered free cash flow represents EUR 66 million compared to our adjusted EBITDA of EUR 63 million, which means a conversion ratio of more than 100%.
Moving now to Slide #8. Our balance sheet and concerning our leverage, we can say that it has decreased to 3.6x in terms of net debt annualized EBITDA, which is below our long-term leverage target ratio of 4x net debt-to-EBITDA. Our total net debt, as you can see in this slide, is EUR 901 million with our bond accounting for most of the debt. When assessing the change in the net debt, it needs to be taken into account that, in January, we paid the second tranche of the last towers acquired from Telefonica back in January 2015.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization changes, these increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. Finally, Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 11 million, with increased revenues partly offset by depreciation change.
Moving to Slide 9. The assumptions behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We believe that we can provide a recurring levered free cash flow that will exceed 10% higher than in 2015, which is in line with market expectations. Looking at the different contribution lines, also the same assumptions apply for each of them, confirming the high visibility of our business.
Finally, Slide 10 and 11, these 2 slides will be taken together. So let me finish the presentation by sharing with you why we believe Cellnex is an attractive investment opportunity. From the current operational perspective, Cellnex is a company with solid fundamentals that provides cash flow visibility and organic growth optionability, leveraging our future revenues streams. But also, on the Slide 11, we can see that thanks to our flexible balance sheet, a strict investment criteria and independency of a neutral operator like Cellnex, we are in a privileged position to consolidate the European tower landscape. It is also important to highlight the current low interest rate environments as a consequence of the recent purchase programs announced by the European Central Bank, from which we can benefit by obtaining very attractive financial rates for future expansion. 
So in a nutshell, Cellnex today is a combination of a strong generator of visible cash flows. We -- I would say, optionability in terms of M&A and organic growth. Everything together, I would say, an attractive valuation as of today."

And these new framework agreements that we tried to also keep the name of the client and the country for us, let me say that will come up as PoPs, organic PoPs, in the next quarters. And we are very happy with this 1% growth of PoPs in this quarter, and we think that this is a good trend that will be supported by these agreements.

I think selling towers is something that right now we do not consider. I think that we have a portfolio that we have to expand, and it makes more sense to complete and to facilitate the country in Italy rather than selling it down. I think that the Italian towers have value. They belong to a network that cover the whole country. And if we can somehow be competitive in the Inwit process it's because we have a very good positioning in the country. If we lose this positioning we are -- maybe we are making money in the short term, but in the long term, we are losing value. So no -- so far, it's not the best-case scenario. Regarding the tenancy ratio, which is your first question, I will say to you that we have been quiet in -- maybe on other occasions. The organic growth we saw last year, 8%, is very high. I would say that, in a normal scenario, between 3% or 4% growth in number of PoPs makes sense. And then this will drive up our tenancy ratio step by step. We do think also that on top of this, we may have the decommissioning effect, and this could somehow increase further our tenancy ratio.

And we are opening the market, and then everyone in our clients would like to have a view on the deal and to have their own point of view. We fully respect and we thank the opportunity that our client give us in order to this -- to do this rationalization project. And at the same time, we have to follow their own concerns and their own decision-making process, which is not -- many times, it takes time, and this is not something customary that you do it from one day to the other. So this is your third question. The first question, you were talking about Yoigo. Yoigo, you know that it is truly -- they have very ambitious plan of coverage in 4G in Spain. Obviously, we have a close relationship with Yoigo. And I think that somehow we should be well positioned to capture part of the growth coming from this and other clients that have to extend their coverage. And finally, the build-to-suit in Italy, you are right. Somehow we are now localizing, so assessing different locations in order to build out the towers. And I think in the next couple of quarters, you will see that these 400 towers step by step are coming. And Fernando, this is something clear, the company is running well.

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones for the period, so Page 4 of the presentation. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that confirm our cash flow visibility. Our recurring levered free cash flow for the period has been slightly above the market expectations. We continue to be in a privileged position to capture future organic growth opportunities. We are the natural candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. Also, all uncertainties around the broadcasting business have been completely removed. And finally, we are glad to announce that our bond is now eligible for the European Central Bank purchase program of corporate bonds.
Moving now to the next slide. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 1% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way for future organic growth by signing contracts in the small cell areas and distributed antenna systems in tunnels. We are also analyzing new DAS projects to be installed in shopping centers and car parks. We continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to announce an agreement in the short term. We are also assessing the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and this analysis is showing a very good progress. Finally, we are constantly engaging in conversations with other clients to assess the potential to improve their coverage, which have resulted in new framework agreement signed.
In the broadcasting area, we can confirm that all uncertainties have been completely removed, that the retendering process of 6 new TV channels have been successfully completed with all channels today broadcasting, thus, providing a stable revenue platform going forward. 
In the network services and other areas, we have also seen a strong network -- a strong performance, thanks to the connectivity business. We have also managed to extend our IoT network in Spain with around 170 additional sites. And we have won several PPDR contracts for transport and utilities applications. In the Smart Cities area, we have submitted 2 proposals in the context of the binding procedures opened by the Spanish government. 
On top of this, we keep analyzing opportunities to continue creating value for our shareholders, and one example is our efficiency program. In this context, we are making good progress on the ground lease front by approaching our landlords with proposals to renegotiate terms and cash advance.
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with the impact of organic growth explaining the changes. We have managed to add more than 200 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.54. On the next chart, we explain in detail the performance of the Telecom Site Rental business in terms of revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contribute EUR 2 million to our consolidated figures while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in the period.
Moving now to adjusted EBITDA. You can see the negative impact of DTT simulcast, which was a one-off positive effect last year. And this impact is more than offset by the contribution of an organic and inorganic growth, with also the positive contribution of organic growth of EUR 2.5 million in this quarter.
Let me now explain in detail our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the quarter. Slide 7. I would like to start by highlighting that the recurring levered free cash flow in the period has increased 14%. 
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increase is mainly due to a strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business is no longer reflecting the simulcast carryout in 2015, and network services and others show a strong increase mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business. 
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase shown is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reaches EUR 63.5 million, in line with our full year guidance and showing a strong 26% increase when compared to last year. Our working capital change remains positive, thanks to our strict management. Although we expect this to be neutral at the year-end, in line with our full year guidance. Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond due in July. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measures as well as the tax regular payment schedule.
Maintenance CapEx will be catching up during the year to reach normalized levels, in line with our guidance. Our non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 6 million associated with cash advances. As a result, you can see that our recurring levered free cash flow represents EUR 66 million compared to our adjusted EBITDA of EUR 63 million, which means a conversion ratio of more than 100%.
Moving now to Slide #8. Our balance sheet and concerning our leverage, we can say that it has decreased to 3.6x in terms of net debt annualized EBITDA, which is below our long-term leverage target ratio of 4x net debt-to-EBITDA. Our total net debt, as you can see in this slide, is EUR 901 million with our bond accounting for most of the debt. When assessing the change in the net debt, it needs to be taken into account that, in January, we paid the second tranche of the last towers acquired from Telefonica back in January 2015.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization changes, these increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. Finally, Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 11 million, with increased revenues partly offset by depreciation change.
Moving to Slide 9. The assumptions behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We believe that we can provide a recurring levered free cash flow that will exceed 10% higher than in 2015, which is in line with market expectations. Looking at the different contribution lines, also the same assumptions apply for each of them, confirming the high visibility of our business.
Finally, Slide 10 and 11, these 2 slides will be taken together. So let me finish the presentation by sharing with you why we believe Cellnex is an attractive investment opportunity. From the current operational perspective, Cellnex is a company with solid fundamentals that provides cash flow visibility and organic growth optionability, leveraging our future revenues streams. But also, on the Slide 11, we can see that thanks to our flexible balance sheet, a strict investment criteria and independency of a neutral operator like Cellnex, we are in a privileged position to consolidate the European tower landscape. It is also important to highlight the current low interest rate environments as a consequence of the recent purchase programs announced by the European Central Bank, from which we can benefit by obtaining very attractive financial rates for future expansion. 
So in a nutshell, Cellnex today is a combination of a strong generator of visible cash flows. We -- I would say, optionability in terms of M&A and organic growth. Everything together, I would say, an attractive valuation as of today."

I think selling towers is something that right now we do not consider. I think that we have a portfolio that we have to expand, and it makes more sense to complete and to facilitate the country in Italy rather than selling it down. I think that the Italian towers have value. They belong to a network that cover the whole country. And if we can somehow be competitive in the Inwit process it's because we have a very good positioning in the country. If we lose this positioning we are -- maybe we are making money in the short term, but in the long term, we are losing value. So no -- so far, it's not the best-case scenario. Regarding the tenancy ratio, which is your first question, I will say to you that we have been quiet in -- maybe on other occasions. The organic growth we saw last year, 8%, is very high. I would say that, in a normal scenario, between 3% or 4% growth in number of PoPs makes sense. And then this will drive up our tenancy ratio step by step. We do think also that on top of this, we may have the decommissioning effect, and this could somehow increase further our tenancy ratio. For these 2 companies, the normal organic growth, 3%, 4% in a year, just add the decommissioning effect on top of this 3%, 4%."

And in that sense, recalling the 400 towers that you have already win, we are not seeing yet delivery on that build-to-suit driver. I would like to know what are the reasons behind. Or is it something that should be accelerating? Or is that in incoming quarters? And finally, I think this question is related with rationalization deals.

Different implications from [indiscernible] and from also, well, different -- there are different things that have to be assessed. It takes time to give comfort to the client, it takes time. But I think that the main concern is that this kind of transactions are somehow new. And we are opening the market, and then everyone in our clients would like to have a view on the deal and to have their own point of view. We fully respect and we thank the opportunity that our client give us in order to this -- to do this rationalization project. And at the same time, we have to follow their own concerns and their own decision-making process, which is not -- many times, it takes time, and this is not something customary that you do it from one day to the other. So this is your third question. The first question, you were talking about Yoigo. Yoigo, you know that it is truly -- they have very ambitious plan of coverage in 4G in Spain. Obviously, we have a close relationship with Yoigo. And I think that somehow we should be well positioned to capture part of the growth coming from this and other clients that have to extend their coverage. And finally, the build-to-suit in Italy, you are right. Somehow we are now localizing, so assessing different locations in order to build out the towers. And I think in the next couple of quarters, you will see that these 400 towers step by step are coming. And Fernando, this is something clear, the company is running well. And without maybe implementing yet the contractualized business we have already -- that will come in the next quarters, so I mean good performance without contractualized business that will come for sure."

Thank you so much for your time today and please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, will present them again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value accretive deals while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first few steps to become the European leader in antenna systems sector. 
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the Ibex 35 Index. 
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. were's closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the 4 mobile operator role across Europe. 
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term. 
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that they profits for TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generated earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue earnings going forward. 
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity. Finally, we keep analyzing anything of opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program on which we are making good progress according to retaining our share with you. 
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015. 
On the next chart, you can find the comprehensive destination of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated while the change of perimeter add EUR 54 million in this period. 
When you go to adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the relative impact of the that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch in our new TV channel [indiscernible] the change of and the contribution for organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period. 
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring leverage free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting the back cash conversion ratio TPH into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%. 
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our stroll organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels in April when compared to the previous quarter, and there were services continued a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business. 
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and so in a strong 17% increase when compared to last year. 
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to effect and to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level. 
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management and in line with our full year guidance. 
Interest paid reflect our current with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And that reflect the implementation of that management measures, as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year. 
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context of the renegotiation of our leases. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and this to take in account, that in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2, and in June, we paid acquisition of We will provide all these details in the that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy. 
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure. 
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities. 
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no financial risk due to the long term of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position and we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost. 
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our activity during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. If we now moved to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Poland, an agreement with to write up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of in Italy. This deal represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify in countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, it is the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities and, therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story. 
And Slide 12, you can see a picture of the new perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All in all, we can clearly state that after these decisions, our business risk profile has improved. 
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio turn EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring leverage free cash flow. This represents around 10% of recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria. 
So now if you assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that was closed first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarters. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPI until 2017, 2018. The scheme, which is indexed to CPI having a flow at 0%. 
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing 15 networks of operators. 
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project as an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player like [indiscernible]. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator. 
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as [indiscernible] there a lot. This acquisition provide us with a first-mover advantage, and the know-how required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is ideal platform to capture what we think we need, a very significant market in the next years. 
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures. 
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino affect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and the path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator. 
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a point perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to replace the very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the [indiscernible] 35 has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see on Page 20."

What is your view the critical portfolio size you would like to achieve? And could you give a bit of guidance on time frame you think you will need to achieve the optimal portfolios size? And then maybe something on an update on the portfolio in Italy. That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you grow up to save EUR 50 million from lease negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? The last question on the process and the 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to on your full year results, could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Poland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs and there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. so we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, other that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving and we will
To consolidate in the next quarters. Again, the question is always execution versus value criteria. We have to give you an answer regarding when, it is very important to understand the criteria also requirement, so it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different elements with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some tower with 10,000 towers. You all know it is market, it is public information that some of these tower costs potentially might be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can't say that, at least there will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that in the capital bond is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think was the target. This year, I think if we go on investing, we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million, EUR 3 million, depending on the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million the first day of the year or the last day of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will be if not this year, next year.  Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers Again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal, I think longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that will come out one day to the market and do something positive, or at least you will see quarter-over-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, PoPs grow."

We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. We will have to go on working, following our internal targets and with a criteria we have to create value for our shareholders. that the Italian market perspective presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, [indiscernible] is keeping twice on this process and I think we have the open to asses with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So give us headroom to growth, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any M&A on our shareholding base and, therefore, will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working, doing good progress but always we're not very basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

Remember, like remember we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when always looking for identification, we have more kind of more cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those are our frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation to the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe has to prepare This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, propositions which is having, in Europe, we ended up don't want to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency possible, so within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminology will be evolved, is able to do an evolution, it would be too higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even in migrating them to high definition, then equal as what we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in the those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital this activity channels."

Of course, you know, Ottavio that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and 1 [indiscernible] you can see how the is typing and is getting more nearer our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it and as soon as the market might be open or might be 1 in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open, so now it is a question of [indiscernible], one, we will be, for sure, willing to fund the company not because we needed because we [indiscernible] needed, it means we are not in a rush. But just on a basis to capture maybe a bond, long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term and, therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So let me answer that question, maybe we could go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will a little bit the business model of CommsCon. And there are 3 boxes, owners, Cellnex, what we do with CommsCon, and our customers. If you follow this graph, you would see that Cellnex has rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex, the deploys CapEx and the OpEx of managing the system And as consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is. We think it is sustainable. We think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not to us [indiscernible] has 2 paths. The first part is stagnant initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will up. And second, we'll received different installments for a long of time.  So from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore we think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops because in the opportunity is massive, all of us would have gone to put a very simple example, in London, when you go
Maybe you have progress in order to send it what's up in order to go on with the conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help the, already, Ottavio, you can repeat it. Ask Alex a citizen."

Discussion. On your first question which was [indiscernible], mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true so densification, more technologies in the single tower means more bandwidth and more frequency spread tower, it means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Normally, this is done by [indiscernible]. So there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the [indiscernible] with fiber. This is a benefit we're all of the MNO are investing, continuing to invest in the coming years, specifically, we were [indiscernible] Cellnex that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this cannot be neutralized so there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the [indiscernible] a CapEx that is what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, in connectivity which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower. Because then, you need to some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you could imagine, is going to be driven very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNO's. We need [indiscernible] around 15% of our towers with fiber so very, very clear these neutralization effect that we're mentioning that the opportunities are clearly there. On the range of 1,000 of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand the and the complexity of that to Fiber-to-the-Tower's. The fiber to the towers is like the roots of a tree.

Regarding your first question, which was accretive impact of these acquisitions on our recurrent leverage free cash flow. The answer, I think, another answer we can go to base testing can see here, EBITDA that on a [indiscernible] we expect for 2017. So after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses and therefore, after these is converted into recorded free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14,5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we think it is a very high conversion ratio and we can't do that because we have in terms of CapEx and working capital and we do -- we structure all transactions in a way that [indiscernible] can be competitive. And also as you were speaking before, that interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive rate. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day one. So we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased 2017 and even 2016. The recurring free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions.

As you can read in our IOM and in the [indiscernible], you will see that we [indiscernible] the earliest we got our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to telecom's rental.

But that will not be an end mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is a silly the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental.

And with adjusted EBITDA that will come as the market is steady and also with very strong free cash flow that will be in line or even slightly than the market consensus. So looking forward to you again in Q2 results. In the meantime, we are here if you have any questions."

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I really share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive destination of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and so in a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax pay reflect the implementation of that management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to right up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we'll close the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think really a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino affect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to replace very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

What is your view, the critical portfolio size, you would like to achieve? And if you could give a bit of guidance on time frame you think you will need to achieve the optimal portfolio size? And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? Then last question on the Russian evasion process, and 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to during full year results. Could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the [indiscernible] program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to asses with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always we're not very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have the broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital [indiscernible] than rest of the channels."

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with [indiscernible] facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility in a long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- underpin [ph] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract. But can we, with your approval, basically on a tower-to-tower basis potentially pass the contract to another operator? I mean, we're not talking about newcomers. Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years. But if they pay or if they negotiate with you, would you be willing to basically for them to sell the contract onto a third party?"

This deal, the Bouygues deal, 500 towers, is a split in 2 parts now, 230 and 270 towers. And the economical terms comparing the EBITDA contribution and the enterprise value are similar. So yes, it is [indiscernible] I thought you were asking for [indiscernible]. But the answer is, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is typing and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when. We will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

The ones that will survive from hatch and the remaining win sites that they combine and they do allocate a set of site that will survive, let's say, from the merge synergy's final agreement.

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset.

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microweb. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

Regarding your first question, which was the accretive impact of these acquisitions on recurring levered free cash flow. And the answer, I think we [indiscernible] we can go to base testing [indiscernible] you can see here, the EBITDA that on a ground rate basis we expect from this period for 2017. So -- and after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses. And therefore, after this EBITDA is converted into recurring levered free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14,5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end [indiscernible] to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental.

I think it is important to maybe do a little bit [indiscernible] on what is the active equipment that we deploy on the DAS. We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a digital [indiscernible] antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for very node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas. That is not -- it's different electronics, I don't know if I was clear myself. And what maybe your second question that I am not answering or did I answer everything?"

As we try to explain in our documentation, it is a distributed antenna where the densification is something different. In terms of deployment, what we believe is that there is, as of today, an immediate need of DAS for densification. But small cells may come in ways a little bit further down the road, because that is quite also another type of equipment, small cells are still yet to be fully prepared by vendors in the full capacity of sharing among different MNOs. So we understand that there is that demand beyond Italy. And there -- it will come in other ways [indiscernible] with the small cells. So we can differentiate slightly between these 2 technologies."

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I really [ph] share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and showing a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is needs to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the Excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to buy up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we closed the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think will be a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino affect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to be place very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? Then last question on the Russian evasion [ph] process, and 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to during full year results. Could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will be some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the capital bonds program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Let me split your questions into parts, 1 and 2 will be answered by myself, and the third one I will invite Alex Mestre, who is the International Director to answer to your question in the GSM 700 megahertz. Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to asses with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always on a very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band",335,"Yes, sure, José Manuel. On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have the broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital [indiscernible] than rest of the channels."

And our value proposition has been, we understand, properly understood, especially in relation to what José Manuel was saying that the low tenancy ratio, in that case, where we are now, it is an advantage because it allows us, let's say, to fit very quickly and in a very big amount of number of sites and new mobile network operator."

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with credit facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility into long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- underpin [ph] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract. But can we, with your approval, basically on a tower-to-tower basis potentially pass the contract to another operator? I mean, we're not talking about newcomers. Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years. But if they pay or if they negotiate with you, would you be willing to basically for them to sell the contract onto a third party?"

So yes, it is [indiscernible] I thought you were asking for [indiscernible]. But the answer is yes, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is tightening [ph] and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when we will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long period of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

So from the merged entity, there will be a bunch of sites, which now belongs to Cellnex, and this is an important part of them. Then, there will be another 2 lots of sites. The ones that will survive from hatch and the remaining win sites that they combine and they do allocate a set of site that will survive, let's say, from the merge synergy's final agreement. And then there will be another bunch of sites that will be probably dispose or offered to Iliad because neither we, neither Hutch will be occupying them. So when it is explained into the press that the new fourth MNO will have access to certain sites, our understanding, [indiscernible] understanding or industrial understanding is that either they will be offered by the merge entity of those sites that will no longer be of the interest by the entity or will be offered at some hosting on the survival sites that the entity will , let's say, next [indiscernible] among them.

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably",617,"Just to complete the last one, I think there is an important issue maybe to emphasize. Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microwaves. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

Regarding your first question, which was the accretive impact of these acquisitions on recurring levered free cash flow. And the answer, I think we [indiscernible] we can go to base testing [indiscernible] you can see here, the EBITDA that on a ground rate basis we expect from this period for 2017. So -- and after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses. And therefore, after this EBITDA is converted into recurring levered free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14.5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end but a mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental. And your last question, which I think is EBITDA growth of DAS, I think maybe Alex, you can help us a little bit here."

So as José Manuel was saying, Page 25 we try to explain a little bit how DAS work. There is one key element that makes those project, let's say, different project-by-project can be categorized in different type of projects. And then, of course, economics may change, especially in relation to the investment. So in many cases, if the venue owner who is limited of some investment, because it brings more [indiscernible] of the venue, because it is -- the owner of the big building that wants to [indiscernible] coverage, so as you can imagine, those projects where there is some CapEx already being deployed by the venue owner are different than the ones that we need to go through the MNOs, convincing them that it is worth to use some CapEx there and then get the critical mass to roll out the project with [indiscernible] and then other [indiscernible] and also having some sort of revenue share if there is one initial [indiscernible]. It is a mix of different models that, to be very honest, we are now understanding -- starting to understand  the complexity. And that's the reason that we acquired the company, which is very much specialized on that niche market. And the key element here is now to try to industrialize a little bit all those concepts and going beyond Italy or more than Italy where these company has been more or less having their commercial activity, going beyond on a difficult culture [indiscernible] try to adapt the model and being able to, let's say, achieve what we are [indiscernible] in the presentation to be a DAS leader operator in Europe.

We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a distributed antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for every node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas. That is not -- it's different electronics, I don't know if I was clear myself. And what maybe your second question that I am not answering or did I answer everything?"

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I really [ph] share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and showing a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is needs to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the Excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to buy up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we closed the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think will be a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino effect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to be place very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

What is your view, the critical portfolio size, you would like to achieve? And if you could give a bit of guidance on time frame you think you will need to achieve the optimal portfolio size? And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? Then last question on the Russian evasion [ph] process, and 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to during full year results. Could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will be some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the capital bonds program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to asses with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always on a very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have the broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital [indiscernible] than rest of the channels."

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with credit facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility into long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- underpin [ph] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract. But can we, with your approval, basically on a tower-to-tower basis potentially pass the contract to another operator? I mean, we're not talking about newcomers. Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years. But if they pay or if they negotiate with you, would you be willing to basically for them to sell the contract onto a third party?"

But the answer is yes, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is tightening [ph] and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when we will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long period of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

So from the merged entity, there will be a bunch of sites, which now belongs to Cellnex, and this is an important part of them. Then, there will be another 2 lots of sites. The ones that will survive from hatch and the remaining win sites that they combine and they do allocate a set of site that will survive, let's say, from the merge synergy's final agreement.

You said in the past that you have sort of demands from a number of clients regarding that opportunity. I know for a fact that one of the clients is very, very keen on such an idea. But maybe can you give us maybe good color about the sort of breadth of the demand that you're seeing, both in Italy and Spain. And maybe add a little bit of sort of economics of the -- all this opportunity. My second question is more of a sort of long-term structural one. Looking at your new markets, both Netherlands and France, do you see sort of a change in shift regarding willingness of MNOs to dispose of the towers? I mean, we know that we've sold in France, we know that [indiscernible] sold in France. We know that KPN sold in that business a while back. But there have been more or less kind of keeping the towers on the books. Do you see if there are any shifts there we should be aware of? And my third question [indiscernible] one, regarding sort of the Telecom Italia's development of new towers with Inwit, will there be any competitive pressure on you immediately? I presume it's no, but just want to make sure that's the case."

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microwaves. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

Regarding your first question, which was the accretive impact of these acquisitions on recurring levered free cash flow. And the answer, I think we [indiscernible] we can go to base testing [indiscernible] you can see here, the EBITDA that on a ground rate basis we expect from this period for 2017. So -- and after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses. And therefore, after this EBITDA is converted into recurring levered free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14.5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end but a mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental.

There is one key element that makes those project, let's say, different project-by-project can be categorized in different type of projects.

It is a mix of different models that, to be very honest, we are now understanding -- starting to understand  the complexity.

We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a distributed antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for every node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas.

And as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained on the Investor Relations sections of our website, where a detailed access file is available. Now please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. 
If you go to Slide 4, you can see that today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that show a strong growth in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring level free cash flow per share when compared to the same period last year. We are also showing solid organic growth in our Telecom Site Rental business that confirms the market expectations for the period. We are delivering on our equity story by executing new accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy for international expansion. We successfully show a second bond, making the most of an attractive market environment with the objective to stand maturities at very competitive terms. 
We are taking the further step to become the European leader in the distributed antenna system sector, whilst positioning Cellnex to capture potential opportunities associated with the future rollout of 5G. And finally, [indiscernible] execution firepower is still available to continue growing, while maintaining our current credit rating for being eligible in the ECP program. 
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 3% when compared to December 2015. And even the number of DAS notes in Italy in just a very short period of time, 3 months. We are proactively analyzing new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator roll across Europe. We'll continue to pursue towards rationalization opportunity with our clients, and our first project is now ongoing. We are also accelerating our build to suit program, while additionally accessing the attractiveness to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers. 
In the broadcasting business, the return in process of 6 new TV channels was successfully completed with all private channels, generating revenues from the beginning of fiber. In the network services and other business, we continue to see a solid performance. I have signed 2 new contracts in the context of Smart City broadband connectivity in our mobility environment. 
Finally, we analyze any single opportunity we find to continue creating value for our shareholders, and such opportunities can be found by efficiently operating our business, improving our capital structure or proactively managing our working capital and taxes, which contribute to our strong recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period. 
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates and recent change of perimeter. We have managed to radically add at almost 700 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.58x. 
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the revenues evolution in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see here how the existing asset base contributes with EUR 6 billion of revenues to our consolidated figure, while the change of perimeter mainly [indiscernible]  Protelindo add EUR 58 million in that period. 
Moving now to consolidated adjusted EBITDA. You can see how the negative impact of a [indiscernible] that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive affect not seen in the year, is more than offset by the switch on of the new TV channels, the contribution of our organic growth and the change of perimeter. 
Let may now explain in detail on Slide 7 our recurrent lever-free cash flow for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurrent lever-free cash flow in the period has been a strong 88%, with the total figure increasing by 26% when compared to 2015. 
Looking out the revenues, the contribution from all the different businesses lines increased with a very well contained cost base, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of 18% when compared to last year. [indiscernible] in CapEx as below our guidance, but is expected to increase during the last quarter to reach more normalized levels. Our working capital changes positive for the period but expected to be neutral at year end, in line with our guidance. 
Interest rates reflect our capital structure as of September, with the coupon associated with our first bond being paid in Q3. Taxes paid reflecting implementation tax management measures as well as the schedule of tax payment due in the year. 
So as you can see, in Page 7, our revenues grow by 15%, our adjusted EBITDA grow 18%, and recurring leverage free cash flow grow even further at 26%. This is one of the key characteristics of Cellnex.  We can grow beyond our revenues growth. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage for the figure has reached 3.7x net debt annualized EBITDA, and is expected to reach 4.5x at year end, including the closing of our recently announced acquisition, Share. Our total borrowings, which around EUR 1.3 billion, with our 2 bonds accounting for all of our debt. When assessing the change in net debt, it needs to be taken into account M&A, interest payments and dividend distribution in the period. Please note that our next dividend payment will be submitted for approval at our Board of Directors meeting that will take place later in December. 
Moving to Slide 9. We have, so far, explained our debt position as of end of December. But given our recent developments, it is worth providing a more attractive picture on our capital structure as of today. You can see on the left-hand side, our current capital structure with new debt instruments, having been, signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, allowing for additional debt associated with potential upcoming growth opportunities. 
Before, we have today a net debt position of EUR 1.47 billion, with additional debt available of around EUR 600 million. On the right-hand side, you can see our debt maturities profile and how it compares with our cash flow generation in cumulative terms, which shows how our cash flow generation covers future financing needs. 
In summary, we have a solid and long-term structure in place with no restrictions. We are, today, a current issuer, with a strong market support. And we are committed with our solid credit rating in order to maintain the eligibility for the purchase program of the European Central Bank. 
Moving to Slide 10. The assumptions we have shared in previous period behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We provide in 2015 our recurring level free cash flow per share increase of 28%, and we are expecting in 2016 an increase of well above 20%. We are proud to show a consistent and significant increase of our key value creation metrics over the years. Given our recent M&A activity, we believe it is worth again offering a quick update on our last deals and also to provide additional insight on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 12, you can see a summary of recent activity. 251 towers from [indiscernible], the acquisition of Commscon in Italy and an agreement with Bouygues to add to 500 towers in France, and now our recent acquisition of [indiscernible] added to our very significant portfolio, allow us to become one of the key players worldwide. 
These deals represent the initial steps into very attractive markets, and allow us to achieve a more focused portfolio of services, ready to capture additional growth. Most importantly, this transaction allow us to diversify into countries with strong credit rating, and strengthen our relationship with a wider array of blue-chip clients, therefore, improving our business risk profile. 
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about cash flow generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion rate from EBITDA into recurrent lever free cash flow is 70%. And the new deals are expected to generate EUR 27 million on a full year basis, or in other words, around 15% of the recurrent lever free cash flow generated in 2015. And all this has been achieved with an extremely efficient capital structure and by applying our restrict investment criteria. 
On Slide 14 show more details on the Dutch operation of our last transaction. I would like to emphasize that we are consolidating our presence in the country, while improving our industrial profile by strengthening our relationship with clients. 
Also, in Slide 15, we offer a summary of our operations in the U.K. It is important to highlight that by acquiring [indiscernible]  group, they first take its next step into a country with a very strong economy with the objective to continue identifying and executing new work opportunities and replicating, therefore, our successful international expansion strategy. 
And finally, Slide 17, just on closing remarks we look before opening for questions. Again, a solid set of results, showing a strong financials and executed value accretive transactions. We have also issued our second bond and work to achieve even more efficient capital structure. First steps to becoming the European leader in the distributed antenna system. And finally, we are still keep execution capacity they continue groping, while improving our distribution profile. 
So with this, I would like to open the line to answer your questions."

In my mind, this sends a mixed signal around AMT's ambition in Europe. On the one hand, it's a pullback, but at same time, it introduced what's probably an energized new part for that business. So it would be interesting to hear your perspective, DC M&A competition increasing from here.  And Secondly, I wanted to pick up on some of the financial problems RTV is having in Spain, the local press reported on as [indiscernible]  Report that says RTV is dramatic action to avoid failing, is there risk to your pricing power for multiple capacity? And when that comes up in renewal? And then, lastly, turning could usher acquisition in the U.K. market. U.K. markets need so much, perhaps the most progressive mobile network sharing market of anywhere in Europe in the form of [indiscernible] and CTIL, we have large and progressive quasi-independent power companies. Given this unique market structure, how is the organic growth outlook in the U.K.? Is it easier or is it any harder comps, compared to your other markets? How was it?"

We -- it's not the first the American Tower is in Europe, so it's not the first movement that they have been in Europe since 2012.  And we have been competing the American Tower in, I think, in the main deals in Europe. So again, I think that American power is really interested in Europe. And they are doing their strategy moves -- movements, taking the position, but nothing new, to be honest, nothing new apart from that they are monetizing parts of their assets. But it remain interest  and this reflects the main, I mean, the attractiveness of the European market. I mean that we have to go beyond. That's the fact. If American Tower -- if they are always looking at Europe, if all this happens is because there is a value in this market. And Cellnex is a first mover. So, of course, and there will be more of movement. So we are ready to work, we are ready to go beyond what is set up. As you said in the last question, U.K. market is a challenging market. Of course, it is. But also there they are very important opportunities and Dutch systems, and we have been variable out here. We really believe we have something to say in this dynamic British market. And there are needs of opportunity that, of course, we are going to work out in detail. And it's now. And of course, they are sharing programs, they are worth sharing, but there are opportunities may need to organic growth, pure organic growth, not only an opportunity to acquire towers. You talk about [indiscernible] well since year 2,00, I think [indiscernible] has had programs, but have not been able to see any different situation since then, to be honest. And this is a public TV. If you Spanish state, how it's performing for the bad and for the good. And it's one of our main clients. And I can tell you something, we will be there to help and to work with our clients so that we'll reach our ways with, at any other time, any agreements.

The 2 specific third is a bit big pitches which relates to the [indiscernible]. A particular one it's on Page 10, you show a breakdown in organic growth, a little bit free cash flow that we could expect going forward for next year above 20%. Now if I do the numbers in terms of what we expect from the generation from the new acquisition, it looks that through M&A, you should grow your a little bit free cash flow by our own 14%. But of course, you do already -- the consolidated sum of this cash this year. So the question is, if you think about the breakdown on for next year, of this above 20% growth you expect on free cash flow, how much will be organic and how much will be through M&A for the acquisition related in it? The second one is I'm going the specifics of your numbers, but organic growth the [indiscernible] you actually record it the highest growth both in Spain and in Italy. Now, I remember during the IPO and  afterwards, you best could be [indiscernible] saying that the telecom business model in Europe is new and we  need time, we have to convince MNOs, but over time, we believe that it could be a ramp up. This is a ramp up, you believe it's happening now, or do you're just going the off and potentially go back to work with this quarters? And the third one is a big picture, but because not in the sector adjustment, new business model, you're bidding for as the towers that [indiscernible] is putting for sale, they actually mentioned during the call, obviously, your time has been pretty vocal. Now later, only this   year, you've been involved in the intimate. And that's this will usually if you're prepared to go to gearing almost 6x that EBITDA. Now it things to change in that credit market, think the change in the market pics. So I was wondering if that 6 eggs is still valid? And that's not the big, this certainly the biggest modeled? And I'm still wondering, do we need a broadcasting business and asking which the synergies you have to [indiscernible] extract. Of course, people consider that you have higher [indiscernible] rating and as the original it is been, but that's because you bought a lot of ad covers from the JV.

So taking into account to one business will start generating EBITDA, for instance, [indiscernible] tower higher generating EBITDA for us since July 1, and may be the French [indiscernible] hours starting to work since late September, and we start to work since late October. So the thing is that, obviously, this -- let me talk here over 20% when compared to the 2015, broadly speaking, it's [indiscernible] growth. It does not belong to M&A. So this is the first point. It's important to see this. And this is [indiscernible] to the follow-up -- one of the other question you have, which is about financing strategy, right? Financing strategy is not the same when you are maybe a company which is based in Spain and winning in Italy or in Italy and then you more diversified with new clients and how we're trying to diversify to increase our business profile. So this change the metrics. And this changes the 6x, the 5x, it changes everything. So when you say we can raise to 6x, my answer is yes, as long as our business risk profile increases, as long as from an operating perspective, and we can say, okay, even though the metric can be a little bit challenging, from that, we have this profile the company cash report further leverage. So the question is, if we'll reach 6x, how we'll deleverage later? We delevered enough more quickly than before, if the answer is yes, then the problem is not 6x, it's all get to the new target in 2017, '18 or '19. So it's a little bit sophisticated more than before. So we can get to 6x, the answer is yes, depending on the business profile and to delevering profile of the company after acquisition. So you have to be on at this we basis. But the point here we will do the most efficient structure to protect our shareholders and also to be eligible because, today, being eligible has a value percent. What else? As you raise the PoPs question, I don't know if it was 2, the second or the third, but it was [indiscernible]  PoPs question, yes, you are right when you said at the moment of the IPO, we were saying that the PoPs growth was not going to be steady in time and want to be leaner. The PoPs growth can have some [indiscernible] and maybe [indiscernible] I don't know how I say in English [indiscernible] if you say that, can be [indiscernible] fast [indiscernible] That's true. However, obviously, in different Q result, we have been vocal about  this, we're saying that 3% is a good level of growth in terms of PoPs. And the sources of this can be several. It can be, for instance, natural organic growth. So more multi-tenancy or can be, for instance, more commissioning. But we think 3x is sustainable, and we'll have to fight for it as a company, at least. And then you were suggesting, to be honest, the last question for me was to understand to follow [indiscernible]."

Now that you actually still keep growing, and of course there is limit up how much the balance sheet could be geared up considering that everybody said earlier. So I was wondering, first of all, which of the synergies we're talking about to keep that broadcasting business in house? And as I can see the higher tenancy ratios here in Spain, but most of them come from because you bought towers with already 2 tenants. So what else we have to talk in terms of the synergies? And second, you recognize that [indiscernible] a big picture, you recognized this business will look like this within 5, 10 years, still a hybrid between broadcasting and tower cell rental.

And this allow us to adopt our clients when, for instance, when you raise the point of what about fiber to the tower, what about the DAS, in the DAS, and you have this in Page 25 or 21.

And as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained on the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed access file is available. Now please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. 
If you go to Slide 4, you can see that, today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that show a strong growth in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring level free cash flow per share when compared to the same period last year. We are also showing solid organic growth in our Telecom Site Rental business that confirms the market expectations for the period. We are delivering on our equity story by executing new accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy for international expansion. We successfully show a second bond, making the most of an attractive market environment, with the objective to stand maturities at very competitive terms. 
We are taking the further step to become the European leader in the distributed antenna system sector, whilst positioning Cellnex to capture potential opportunities associated with the future rollout of 5G. And finally, enough execution firepower is still available to continue growing, while maintaining our current credit rating for being eligible in the ECB program. 
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 3% when compared to December 2015, and even the number of DAS notes in Italy in just a very short period of time, 3 months. We are proactively analyzing new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe. We continue to pursue tower rationalization opportunity with our clients, and our first project is now ongoing. We are also accelerating our build to suit program, while additionally accessing the attractiveness to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers. 
In the broadcasting business, the return in process of 6 new TV channels was successfully completed with all private channels, generating revenues from the beginning of fiber. In the network services and other business, we continue to see a solid performance. I have signed 2 new contracts in the context of Smart Cities broadband connectivity in our mobility environment. 
Finally, we analyze any single opportunity we find to continue creating value for our shareholders. And such opportunities can be found by efficiently operating our business, improving our capital structure or proactively managing our working capital and taxes, which contribute to our strong recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period. 
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates and recent change of perimeter. We have managed to radically add almost 700 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.58x. 
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the revenue's evolution in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see here how the existing asset base contributes with EUR 6 billion of revenues to our consolidated figure, while the change of perimeter, mainly Galata and Protelindo, add EUR 58 million in that period. 
Moving now to consolidated adjusted EBITDA. You can see how the negative impact of a DTT simulcast that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect not seen in the year, is more than offset by the switch on of the new TV channels, the contribution of our organic growth and the change of perimeter. 
Let may now explain in detail on Slide 7 our recurrent levered free cash flow generation for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 88%, with the total figure increasing by 26% when compared to 2015. 
Looking at the revenues, the contribution from all the different businesses lines increased with a very well contained cost base, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of 18% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx is below our guidance, but is expected to increase during the last quarter to reach more normalized levels. Our working capital change is positive for the period, but expected to be neutral at the year-end, in line with our guidance. 
Interests paid reflect our capital structure as of September, with a coupon associated with our first bond being paid in Q3. Taxes paid reflect implementation of tax management measures, as well as the schedule of tax payment due in the year. 
So as you can see, in Page 7, our revenues grow by 15%, our adjusted EBITDA grows 18% and recurring levered free cash flow grows even further at 26%. This is one of the key characteristics of Cellnex.  We can grow beyond our revenue growth. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex's leverage for the figure has reached 3.7x net debt annualized EBITDA and is expected to reach 4.5x at year-end, including the closing of our recently announced acquisition, Shere. Our total borrowings, which are around EUR 1.3 billion with our 2 bonds accounting for all of our debt. When assessing the change in net debt, it needs to be taken into account M&A, interest payments and dividend distribution in the period. Please note that our next dividend payment will be submitted for approval at our Board of Directors meeting that will take place later in December. 
Moving to Slide 9. We have so far explained our debt position as of end of December. But given our recent developments, it is worth providing a more attractive picture on our capital structure as of today. You can see on the left-hand side our current capital structure with new debt instruments, having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, allowing for additional debt associated with potential upcoming growth opportunities. 
Before, we have today a net debt position of EUR 1.47 billion, with additional debt available of around EUR 600 million. On the right-hand side, you can see our debt maturities profile and how it compares with our cash flow generation in cumulative terms, which shows how our cash flow generation covers future financing needs. 
In summary, we have a solid and long-term structure in place with no restrictions. We are, today, a current issuer with a strong market support, and we are committed with our solid credit rating in order to maintain the eligibility for the purchase program of the European Central Bank. 
Moving to Slide 10. The assumptions we have shared in previous periods behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We provide in 2015 a recurrent levered free cash flow per share increase of 28%, and we're expecting in 2016 an increase of well above 20%. We are proud to show a consistent and significant increase of our key value creation metric over the years. Given our recent M&A activity, we believe it is worth again offering a quick update on our last deals, and also to provide additional insight on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 12, you can see a summary of recent activity, 251 towers from Protelindo, the acquisition of Commscon in Italy, an agreement with Bouygues to add up to 500 towers in France. And our recent acquisition of Shere Group added to our very significant portfolio allow us to become one of the key players worldwide. 
These deals represent the initial steps into very attractive markets and allow us to achieve a more focused portfolio of services, ready to capture additional growth. Most importantly, this transaction allows us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating, and strengthen our relationship with a wider array of blue-chip clients, therefore, improving our business risk profile. 
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about cash flow generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion rate from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 70%. And the new deals are expected to generate EUR 27 million on a full year basis or, in other words, around 15% of the recurrent levered free cash flow generated in 2015. And all this has been achieved with an extremely efficient capital structure and by applying our strict investment criteria. 
On Slide 14 show more details on the Dutch operation of our last transaction. I would like to emphasize that we are consolidating our presence in the country, while improving our industrial profile by strengthening our relationship with clients. 
Also, in Slide 15, we offer a summary of our operations in the U.K. It is important to highlight that by acquiring Shere Group, Cellnex takes its first step into a country with a very strong economy, with the objective to continue identifying and executing new work opportunities and replicating, therefore, our successful international expansion strategy. 
And finally, Slide 17, just on closing remarks before opening for questions. Again, a solid set of results, showing strong financials and executed value accretive transactions. We have also issued our second bond in order to achieve even more efficient capital structure, first steps to becoming the European leader in the distributed antenna system. And finally, we still keep execution capacity to continue growing while improving our  business risk profile. 
So with this, I would like to open the line to answer your questions."

I have 3 questions, please. Yesterday, we had American Tower announce a joint venture with the Dutch pension fund, PGGM, where it's going to transfer its German operation into new vehicle, and then sell a state to PGGM. In my mind, this sends mixed signals around AMT's ambitions in Europe. On the one hand, it's a pullback. But at same time, it introduced what's probably an energized new partner for that business. So it'd be interesting to hear your perspective. Do you see M&A competition increasing from here? Secondly, I wanted to pick up on some of the financial problems RTVE is having in Spain. The local press has reported on the SCPI. Reporter says RTVE needs dramatic action to avoid failing. Is there any risk to your pricing power for multiplex capacity when that comes up for renewal? And then, lastly, turning to the Shere acquisition in the U.K. market. The U.K. market's quite unique in so much that it's perhaps the most progressive mobile network-sharing market of anywhere in Europe in the form of MBNL and CTIL. We have large and progressive quasi-independent power companies. Given this unique market structure, how is the organic growth outlook in the U.K.? Any easier or any harder compared to your other markets? That was it."

And we -- it's not the first time the American Tower is in Europe, so it's not the first movement that -- they have been in Europe since 2012, the beginning. We have been competing with American Tower in -- I think in the main deals in Europe. So again, I think that American Tower is really interested in Europe. So -- and they are doing their strategy moves, movements and their taking the position. But nothing new, to be honest, nothing new apart from that they are monetizing parts of their assets. But it remain interest -- and this, at the end of the day, reflects the main -- I mean, the attractiveness of the European market. I think that we have to go beyond the fact if American Tower -- if there's -- all the leaders looking at Europe. If all this happens is because there is a value in this market. And Cellnex is a first mover here. So of course, and there will be more movement. So we are ready to work. We are ready to go beyond what is set up. As you said in the last question, U.K. market is a challenging market. Of course, it is. But also, they are very important opportunities, Dutch systems, and we have been very vocal here. We really believe we can -- we have something to say in this dynamic British market. And there are needs of opportunity that, of course, we are going to work out in detail. And it's now. And of course, they are sharing programs that are now worth sharing. But there are also opportunities maybe through organic growth, pure organic growth, not only the possibility to acquire towers. You talked about Radiotelevisión Española. Well, since year 2,000, I think Radiotelevisión Española has had programs. But I have not been able to see any different situation since then, to be honest. This is a public TV. You know the Spanish state, how it is performing for the bad and for the good, and is one of our main clients. And I can tell you something, we will be there to help and to work with our client so that we'll reach other ways with, as any other client, win agreements. But we don't have this position being white or black. It's nothing new for us. It's our normal way of somehow reacting and working."

So basically, the way we are taking our guidance here is everything we said at the beginning of the year is still valid. And market consensus before M&A during the year is valid, and we will look to increase that. And then on top of that, we should be expecting the proportional portion of the money contribution within the year, which is in line with the magnitude we have raised with the market. And then in terms of network services and others, well, this is an area where, for example, we have trading, which is the sale of equipment, and that provides with some volatility in the performance quarter-on-quarter. So this is the explanation of the performance for the period. And finally, on France, bear in mind that we closed the first batch of towers at the beginning -- sorry, at the end of the period. So it's just a few days of contribution in the quarter. And also, the number of towers are, today, 113. And then we are also expecting the remaining part of the 230 batch will be contributing to our figures the moment we receive the waiver from our landlords. So that is expected to happen during the coming weeks, and that has nothing to do with the second batch of the agreement. So 230 that has already been closed, 113 that was already contributing, and we are expecting to integrate the remaining part of that state over the coming weeks."

For me, and as a CFO, it will be very difficult to estimate the risk in Nigeria. It's for me, it would be very difficult. So I don't know which data I could estimate. I don't know. I don't know how it can -- FX. So there are many things when comparing how strict from an M&A perspective we are. It's difficult to know exactly point-by-point.

I know you've had discussions of Iliad on their Italian move. I was wondering if you have any knowledge you could share in terms of when they might launch and what sort of strategy they may deploy? Second question is just in terms of your presentation, you highlight new opportunities from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator all across Europe. And are you talking specifically here for a third and fourth come together? Are you saying more where fourth mobile operator maybe goes for a CapEx line approach, maybe out of Buick, whey they're considering to sell tires and use this sort of tire-sharing model. And then just a last quick question, if you don't mind. On rental cars, there's been a very small creep in Spain initially, but it makes me wonder how you're progressing in terms of your site renegotiation strategy. I remember you were targeting 5,000 sites for renegotiation, predominantly in Italy."

So that's the -- at least, we should be expecting the Iliad to start their business in the country. So from there, depending on how they want to deploy the network, now if there are opportunities to capture, obviously, we will be talking to them. So -- but in any case, it's not an opportunity to be materialized in a very short term, as the company has not even started commercial operations in the country. On the 4th operator awarding we've used in the presentation, that is linked to Iliad. And also, that is linked to much more willing in -- sorry, Iliad in Italy and much more willing in Spain. Basically, what they're trying to say here is that, at the moment, we'll find an opportunity to do business with our fourth operator willing to deploy on network. We will be willing to offer our portfolio and try to capture organic growth from them. So we have specifically having in mind these 2 opportunities, both in Italy and in Spain. And your third question, rental cost, bear in mind that on the rent line in our P&L, it's not the [indiscernible] we have. You also have the expenses associated with our car fleet, satellite cost, connectivity cost if we use third-party fiber. So we will leave our ground lease cost fiber content. The slight increase is due to some other lines contributing to this trend cost. And we are on track with our efficiency program. Hopefully, we can provide more visibility on the specific savings we are achieving. You can see that on the amount of money expansion on CapEx, we are about in important resources to our cost [indiscernible] program. So everything is on track."

The other question is, in terms of the economics of these DAS nodes, if you can give anything in terms how many tenants you've got at the moment? And what rates do you get from your tenants?

And we are mainly talking about new projects, very small projects. But it's not because of new nodes of additional nodes being associated with specific MNOs, simply Commscon being able to generate business in new locations in the north of Italy. Then, on the economics of this business, we are still working on that in a sense that we are working on a group-wide business plan. So at some point, sure thing, we will provide more color on how we see the economies of DAS business portfolio whole of the Cellnex Group. Bear in mind that the revenue per node might change depending on the involvement of the client on the development of the network. So it's Commscon deploying the whole CapEx. We might be able to achieve higher revenue per node if the -- if any owner, for example, is willing to co-invest with Commscon also the associated fees of solo work. So we have a wider range of possibilities within this business model. Then on the passthrough, we are not providing the breakdown in terms of what is exactly the amount of pass-throughs coming on the annual accounts. We are giving that figure for the full year. Basically, bear in mind that in some cases, we don't have dedicated counters within some shelters. So it's a matter of negotiating with the customer on an operating basis, on the adjustments to be made on the passthrough cost associated with electricity. So it is true that in this case in this quarter for Spain, there have been some adjustments to the star contributor to the revenue space. And this is why the performance for the quarter is flat, offsetting the pure organic growth in any given period. But you have to look at from an EBITDA perspective that the growth is coming because it is -- you cannot only see the revenues, you can see -- you have to see also the attached OpEx. So if you this somehow split of revenues and cost associated, you would be able to see that the EBITDA is coming anyway."

Now if I do the numbers in terms of what we expect from the generation, from the new acquisition, it looks that through M&A, you should grow your -- a little bit of free cash flow by around 14%. But of course, you do already the consolidated sum of this cash this year. So the question is, if you think about breakdown on for next year of this above 20% growth you expect on levered free cash flow, how much will be organic and how much will be through M&A for the acquisition you've already seen? The second one, it's -- I'm going to the specifics of your number, in organic growth, the PoPs, you actually recorded the highest growth, both in Spain and in Italy.

And at that stage, you showed us that you were prepared to go to a gearing of almost 6x that EBITDA. Now things do change in the credit market. Things do change in the market generally. So I was wondering if that 6x is still valid? And that's not the sort of your biggest modeled. I'm still wondering, do you really need to have a broadcasting business in Spain? Which sort of synergies will basically extract? Of course, people can say that you've got a high tenancy ratio in Spain than in Italy, but that's because you bought a lot of ad covers from the JV. So I was just wondering, there could be, also going forward, the possibility profitable of reviewing the best model focused more on tower rental rather than just on the average that you have at the moment and potentially see the broadcasting as a way to cash it in?"

Now in Page 10, what we said to you is while we expect for full year and 2016 and from accountancy -- accounting basis. So taking into account that one business will start generating EBITDA. For instance, Protelindo tower",580,"Yes, the breakdown of the growth. Now in Page 10, what we said to you is while we expect for full year and 2016 and from accountancy -- accounting basis. So taking into account that one business will start generating EBITDA. For instance, Protelindo towers are generating EBITDA for us since July 1. And maybe the French towers are starting to work since late September, and Shere Group will start to work since late October, something like that. So the thing is that, obviously, this -- when we talk here about over 20% when compared to 2015, broadly speaking, it's minority feed belongs to organic growth. It does not belong to M&A, okay? So this is the first point. It's important to see this. And this is very linked to the follow -- one of the other questions you have raised, which was about a financing strategy, right? Financing strategy is not the same when you are maybe a company which is based in Spain and with win in Italy -- or in Italy with Galata, sorry. And then you become more diversified with new clients and how we are trying to diversify or to increase our business risk profile. So this changed the metrics. And this changes the 6x, the 5x. It changed everything. So when you say we can raise to 6x, my answer is, yes, as long as our business risk profile increases. As long as from a credit perspective, and we can say, ""Okay. Even though the metric can be a little bit challenging, from that business risk profile, the company can support further leverage."" So the question is, if we reach 6x, how we'll deleverage later? We delevered enough more quickly than before. If the answer is yes, then the problem is not 6x. It's how you get to the new target in 2017, '18 or '19. So it's a little bit sophisticated more than before. So we can get to 6x, the answer is yes. It depends on the business risk profile and the delever -- the delevering profile of the company after the acquisition. So you have to be done on a rate-by-rate cases. But the point here is we'll do the most efficient structure to protect our shareholders and also to be eligible because, today, being eligible has a value percent. What else? As you raise the PoPs question, I don't know if it was the 2 -- the second or the third, but it was in the middle. PoPs question, yes, you are right when you said that at the moment of the IPO, we were saying that the PoPs growth was not going to be steady in time and want to be leaner. The PoPs growth can have some jumps maybe. So we need some -- I don't know how you say it in English -- or choppy, I think you say that, can be relative [indiscernible] and that's true. However, also in different Q results, we are very vocal about this. Witnessing that 3% is a good level of growth in terms of PoPs. And the sources of this can be several. It can be, for instance, natural organic growth. So more multi-tenancy or can be, for instance, more commissioning. But we think 3% is sustainable, and we'll have to fight for it as a company, at least. And then you were suggesting, to be honest, the last question for me was to understand, to follow, so you can..."

You are more than an exception than a rule in terms of your business model. You have broadcasting and tower site rental on the same company. And this comes from history because, of course, the broadcasting was the historical business, and then you divested it, by the way. Now that you actually still keep growing, and of course, there is limit up to how much the balance sheet could be geared up, consider that they -- everybody said earlier. So I was wondering, first of all, what of sort synergies are we talking about to keep that broadcasting business in-house? And I said, I can see the high tenancy ratios you have in Spain, but most of them come from because you bought towers with already 2 tenants. So what else do we have to talk in terms of synergies? And second, you reckoned that and obviously a big picture. You recognized that the business will look like this within 5, 10 years, still a hybrid between broadcasting and tower site rental. Hopefully, that's now more clear."

I mean, starting from the revenues and starting for the clients, our broadcasting tower can give service to the Telecom -- to us. So this is question A. Second, broadcasting for us is a must -- sorry, is an end or it is a mean. For us, broadcasting is a mean. Broadcasting allows us to generate somehow visibility in our cash flows to keep our relationship with very important clients, which whom we can, as you were suggesting, develop further the broadcasting. You were talking about hybrid services that we are also targeting. And we would like to be there as a first mover again to adapt the company to the new situation. But the most important synergy is not this one. The most important is the first one. The most important synergy is that we have -- somehow, we have the experience, all the experience learned from broadcasting to have a different angle in Telecom Site Rental. We are managing -- in the broadcasting, we are managing -- in the value chain, we are managing much more steps of these value chains. And this allow us to adopt our client when, for instance, when you raised the point of what about fiber to the tower? What about the DAS? In the DAS -- and you have this in Page 25 or 21. You can see here we are -- in the DAS system, we are already managing asset equipment. You are better positioned to do so if you hopped on it with broadcasting, just because the team is prepared. You have engineers. You have many things. So this gives us a real competitive advantage, okay? So the synergies is not only revenues. It's not only, I would say -- as a second point. But also, it's about know-how."

And as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained on the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed Excel file is available. Now please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. 
If you go to Slide 4, you can see that, today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that show a strong growth in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring level free cash flow per share when compared to the same period last year. We are also showing solid organic growth in our Telecom Site Rental business that confirms the market expectations for the period. We are delivering on our equity story by executing new accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy for international expansion. We successfully show a second bond, making the most of an attractive market environment, with the objective to stand maturities at very competitive terms. 
We are taking the further step to become the European leader in the distributed antenna system sector, whilst positioning Cellnex to capture potential opportunities associated with the future rollout of 5G. And finally, enough execution firepower is still available to continue growing, while maintaining our current credit rating for being eligible in the ECB program. 
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 3% when compared to December 2015, and even the number of DAS notes in Italy in just a very short period of time: 3 months. We are proactively analyzing new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe. We continue to pursue tower rationalization opportunities with our clients, and our first project is now ongoing. We are also accelerating our Build to Suit program, while additionally assessing the attractiveness to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers. 
In the broadcasting business, the return in [ph] process of 6 new TV channels was successfully completed with all private channels, generating revenues from the beginning of fiber [ph]. In the network services and other business, we continue to see a solid performance. I have signed 2 new contracts in the context of Smart Cities broadband connectivity in our mobility environment. 
Finally, we analyze any single opportunity we find to continue creating value for our shareholders. And such opportunities can be found by efficiently operating our business, improving our capital structure or proactively managing our working capital and taxes, which contribute to our strong recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period. 
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates and recent change of perimeter. We have managed to organically add almost 700 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.58x. 
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the revenue's evolution in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see here how the existing asset base contributes with EUR 6 million of revenues to our consolidated figure, while the change of perimeter, mainly Galata and Protelindo, add EUR 58 million in that period. 
Moving now to consolidated adjusted EBITDA. You can see how the negative impact of the DTT simulcast that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect not seen in the year, is more than offset by the switch on of the new TV channels, the contribution of our organic growth and the change of perimeter. 
Let may now explain in detail on Slide 7 our recurrent levered free cash flow generation for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 88%, with the total figure increasing by 26% when compared to 2015. 
Looking at the revenues, the contribution from all the different businesses lines increased with a very well contained cost base, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of 18% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx is below our guidance, but is expected to increase during the last quarter to reach more normalized levels. Our working capital change is positive for the period, but expected to be neutral at the year-end, in line with our guidance. 
Interests paid reflect our capital structure as of September, with a coupon associated with our first bond being paid in Q3. Taxes paid reflect implementation of tax management measures, as well as the schedule of tax payment due in the year. 
So as you can see, in Page 7, our revenues grow by 15%, our adjusted EBITDA grows 18% and recurring levered free cash flow grows even further at 26%. This is one of the key characteristics of Cellnex.  We can grow beyond our revenue growth. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex's leverage for the period has reached 3.7x net debt annualized EBITDA and is expected to reach 4.5x at year-end, including the closing of our recently announced acquisition, Shere. Our total borrowings, which are around EUR 1.3 billion with our 2 bonds accounting for all of our debt. When assessing the change in net debt, it needs to be taken into account M&A, interest payments and dividend distribution in the period. Please note that our next dividend payment will be submitted for approval at our Board of Directors meeting that will take place later in December. 
Moving to Slide 9. We have so far explained our debt position as of end of September. But given our recent developments, it is worth providing a more updated picture on our capital structure as of today. You can see on the left-hand side our current capital structure with new debt instruments, having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, allowing for additional debt associated with potential upcoming growth opportunities. 
Before, we have today a net debt position of EUR 1.47 billion, with additional debt available of around EUR 600 million. On the right-hand side, you can see our debt maturities profile and how it compares with our cash flow generation in cumulative terms, which shows how our cash flow generation covers future financing needs. 
In summary, we have a solid and long-term structure in place with no restrictions. We are, today, a current issuer with a strong market support, and we are committed with our solid credit rating in order to maintain the eligibility for the purchase program of the European Central Bank. 
Moving to Slide 10. The assumptions we have shared in previous periods behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We provide in 2015 our recurrent levered free cash flow per share increase of 28%, and we're expecting in 2016 an increase of well above 20%. We are proud to show a consistent and significant increase of our key value creation metric over the years. Given our recent M&A activity, we believe it is worth again offering a quick update on our last deals, and also to provide additional insight on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 12, you can see a summary of recent activity, 261 towers from Protelindo, the acquisition of Commscon in Italy, an agreement with Bouygues to add up to 500 towers in France. And our recent acquisition of Shere Group which added to our already significant portfolio allow us to become one of the key players worldwide. 
These deals represent the initial steps into very attractive markets and allow us to achieve a more focused portfolio of services, ready to capture additional growth. Most importantly, this transaction allows us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating, and strengthen our relationship with a wider array of blue-chip clients, therefore, improving our business risk profile. 
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about cash flow generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion rate from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 70%. And the new deals are expected to generate EUR 27 million on a full year basis or, in other words, around 15% of the recurrent levered free cash flow generated in 2015. And all this has been achieved with an extremely efficient capital structure and by applying our strict investment criteria. 
On Slide 14 show more details on the Dutch operation of our last transaction. I would like to emphasize that we are consolidating our presence in the country, while improving our industrial profile by strengthening our relationship with clients. 
Also, in Slide 15, we offer a summary of our operations in the U.K. It is important to highlight that by acquiring Shere Group, Cellnex takes its first step into a country with a very strong economy, with the objective to continue identifying and executing new work opportunities and replicating, therefore, our successful international expansion strategy. 
And finally, Slide 17, just on closing remarks before opening for questions. Again, a solid set of results, showing strong financials and executed value accretive transactions. We have also issued our second bond in order to achieve even more efficient capital structure, first steps to becoming the European leader in the distributed antenna system. And finally, we still keep execution capacity to continue growing while improving our  business risk profile. 
So with this, I would like to open the line to answer your questions."

So it'd be interesting to hear your perspective. Do you see M&A competition increasing from here? Secondly, I wanted to pick up on some of the financial problems RTVE is having in Spain. The local press has reported on the SCPI. Reporter says RTVE needs dramatic action to avoid failing. Is there any risk to your pricing power for multiplex capacity when that comes up for renewal?

I think that we have to go beyond on the fact -- if American Tower -- if there's -- all the leaders looking at Europe. If all this happens is because there is a value in this market. And Cellnex is a first mover here. So of course, and there will be more movement. So we are ready to work. We are ready to go beyond what is set up. As you said in the last question, U.K. market is a challenging market. Of course, it is. But also, they are very important opportunities -- DAS systems, no? And we have been very vocal here. We really believe we can -- we have something to say in this dynamic British market. And there are niches of opportunity that, of course, we are going to work out in detail. And it's now. And of course, there are sharing programs that are not [ph] worth sharing. But there are also opportunities maybe through organic growth, pure organic growth, not only the possibility to acquire towers. You talked about Radiotelevisión Española. Well, since year 2000, I think, Radiotelevisión Española has had programs. But I have not been able to see any different situation since then, to be honest. This is a public TV. You know the Spanish state, how it is performing for the bad and for the good, and is one of our main clients. And I can tell you something, we will be there to help and to work with our client so that we'll reach other ways with -- ask any other client, we win agreements. But we don't have this position being white or black. It's nothing new for us. It's our normal way of somehow reacting and working."

So basically, the way we are taking our guidance here is everything we said at the beginning of the year is still valid. And market consensus before M&A during the year is valid, and we will look to increase that. And then on top of that, we should be expecting the proportional portion of the money contribution within the year, which is in line with the magnitude we have raised with the market. And then in terms of network services and others, well, this is an area where, for example, we have trading, which is the sale of equipment, and that provides with some volatility in the performance quarter-on-quarter. So this is the explanation of the performance for the period. And finally, on France, bear in mind that we closed the first batch of towers at the beginning -- sorry, at the end of the period. So it's just a few days of contribution in the quarter. And also, the number of towers are, today, 113. And then we are also expecting the remaining part of the 230 batch will be contributing to our figures the moment we receive the waiver from our landlords. So that is expected to happen during the coming weeks, and that has nothing to do with the second batch of the agreement. So 230 that has already been closed, 113 that was already contributing, and we are expecting to integrate the remaining part of that state over the coming weeks."

For me, and as a CFO, it will be very difficult to estimate the risk in Nigeria. It's for me, it would be very difficult. So I don't know which data I could estimate. I don't know. I don't know how it can -- FX. So there are many things when comparing how strict from an M&A perspective we are. It's difficult to know exactly point-by-point. What I can tell you is that we are focused on long-term contracts. We are focused on reducing FX risk. We are focused on mature economies. And therefore, all these together defines M&A and some requirements, which has to be filled. So it's difficult to compare. It's my question -- my answer to that question. Your second question, which is about American Tower, well, again, we can be a target or not. It's something that should be answered by American Tower. What I can tell you is that the European market, even though it's mature, even though there is no FX raised and even though maybe inflation is not very high, even though everything seems to be interesting and there are lot of value to unlock.

So we have a wider range of possibilities within this business model. Then on the pass-through, we are not providing the breakdown in terms of what is exactly the amount of pass-throughs coming on the annual accounts. We are giving that figure for the full year. Basically, bear in mind that in some cases, we don't have dedicated counters within some shelters. So it's a matter of negotiating with the customer on an operating basis, on the adjustments to be made on the pass-through cost associated with electricity. So it is true that in this case, in this quarter for Spain, there have been some adjustments to the star contributor to this revenue space. And this is why the performance for the quarter is flat, offsetting the pure organic growth generated in the given period. But you have to look at from an EBITDA perspective that the growth is coming because it is -- you cannot only see the revenues, you can see -- you have to see also the attached OpEx. So if you have this somehow split of revenues and cost associated, you would be able to see that the EBITDA is coming anyway."

The third, it's a bit big picture, but relates to your business model. This particular one, it's on Page 10. You show a breakdown in organic growth, in levered free cash flow putout that we could expect going forward for next year above 20%. Now if I do the numbers in terms of what we expect from the generation, from the new acquisition, it looks that through M&A, you should grow your -- levered free cash flow by around 14%. But of course, you do already the consolidated sum of this cash this year. So the question is, if you can give a breakdown for next year of this above 20% growth you expect on levered free cash flow, how much will be organic and how much will be through M&A for the acquisition you've already seen it? The second one, it's -- I'm going into the specifics of your number. In organic growth, the PoPs, you actually recorded the highest growth, both in Spain and in Italy. Now I remember during the IPO and afterwards, you guys have been passionate saying that the telco business model in Europe is new. We need time. We have to convince MNOs. But over time, we believe that it could be a ramp-up. Is this a ramp-up you believe is happening now or you're going to adjust the one-off and potentially go back to what we've seen in previous quarters? And the third one, it's a big picture, but because -- not in the sector adjustment, just on your business model. You're bidding for the towers that Antin is putting for sale. They actually mentioned during the call. But obviously, your chairman has been pretty vocal. Now early this year, you have been involved in the Inwit. And at that stage, you showed us that you were prepared to go to a gearing of almost 6x net EBITDA. Now, things do change in the credit market. Things do change in the market generally. So I was wondering if that 6x is still valid? And that's not the big -- the sort of your biggest modeled. I'm still wondering, do you really need to have a broadcasting business in Spain? Which sort of synergies do you basically extract? Of course, people can say that you've got a high tenancy ratio in Spain than in Italy, but that's because you bought a lot of ad covers from the JV. So I was just wondering, there could be, also going forward, the possibility of reviewing your business model and focusing more on tower rental rather than just on the average [ph] that you have at the moment and potentially see the broadcasting as a way to cash it in?"

Now in Page 10, what we said to you is not -- is what we expect for full year in 2016 and from accountancy -- accounting basis. So taking into account that one business will start generating EBITDA. For instance, Protelin",595,"Yes, the breakdown of the growth. Now in Page 10, what we said to you is not -- is what we expect for full year in 2016 and from accountancy -- accounting basis. So taking into account that one business will start generating EBITDA. For instance, Protelindo towers with a [indiscernible] are generating EBITDA for us since July 1. And maybe the French towers are starting to work since late September, and Shere Group will start to work since late October, something like that. So the thing is that, obviously, this -- when we talk here about over 20% when compared to 2015, broadly speaking, its minority feed belongs to organic growth. It does not belong to M&A, okay? So this is the first point. It's important to see this. And this is very linked to the follow -- one of the other questions you have raised, which was about a financing strategy, no? Financing strategy is not the same when you are maybe a company which is based in Spain and with win in Italy -- or in Italy with the Galata, sorry. And then you become more diversified with new clients and how we are trying to diversify or to increase our business risk profile. So this changed the metrics. And this changes the 6x, the 5x. It changed everything. So when you say we can raise to 6x, my answer is, yes, as long as our business risk profile increases. As long as from a credit perspective we can say, ""Okay. Even though the metric can be a little bit challenging, from a business risk profile, the company can support further leverage."" So the question is, if we reach 6x, how we'll deleverage later? We delevered enough more quickly a way than before? If the answer is yes, then the problem is not 6x. It's how you get to the new target in 2017, '18 or '19. So it's a little bit sophisticated more than before. So we can get to 6x, the answer is yes. It depends on the business risk profile and the delever -- the delevering profile of the company after the acquisition. So you have to be done on a base-by-base cases (sic) [case-by-case basis]. But the point here is we'll do the most efficient structure to protect our shareholders and also to be eligible because, today, being eligible has a value percent. What else? You raised the PoPs question, I don't know if it was the 2 -- the second or the third, but it was in the middle. PoPs question, yes, you are right when you said that at the moment of the IPO, we were saying that the PoPs growth was not going to be steady in time and was going to be leaner. The PoPs growth can have some jumps maybe. So we need some -- I don't know how you say it in English -- or choppy, I think you say that can be a little bumpy. Bumps. And that's true. However, also in different Q results, we have been vocal about this. Witnessing that 3% is a good level of growth in terms of PoPs. And the sources of this can be several. It can be, for instance, natural organic growth. So more multi-tenancy or can be, for instance, more commissioning. But if we think 3% is sustainable, and we'll have to fight for it as a company, at least. And then you were suggesting, to be honest, the last question for me was difficult to understand, to follow, so you can..."

Now that you actually still keep growing, and of course, there is limit up to how much the balance sheet could be geared up, consider that they -- what you said earlier. So I was wondering, first of all, what of sort synergies are we talking about to keep that broadcasting business in-house?

And second, do you think -- and obviously the big pictures. Do you think that the business will look like this within 5, 10 years, still a hybrid between broadcasting and tower site rental? Hopefully, that's now more clear."

And you -- I remember, you were in the IPO and you -- we explained at that moment. And this information is available in the website or at least in the -- for yet or no. So the reason's very clear. I mean, starting from the revenues and starting for the clients, our broadcasting tower can give service to the telecom -- to MNOs. So this is question A. Second, broadcasting for us is a must -- sorry, is an end or it is a mean. For us, broadcasting is a mean. Broadcasting allows us to generate somehow visibility in our cash flows to keep our relationship with very important clients, which whom we can, as you were suggesting, develop further the broadcasting. You were talking about hybrid services that we are also targeting. And we would like to be there as a first mover again to adapt the company to the new situation. But the most important synergy is not this one. The most important is the first one. The most important synergy is that we have -- somehow, we have the experience, all the experience learned from broadcasting to have a different angle in Telecom Site Rental. We are managing -- in the broadcasting, we are managing -- in the value chain, we are managing much more steps of these value chains. And this allow us to adapt our client when, for instance, when you raised the point of what about fiber to the tower? What about the DAS? In the DAS -- and you have this in Page 25 or 21. You can see here we are -- in the DAS system, we are already managing asset equipment. You are better positioned to do so if you hopped on it with broadcasting, just because the team is prepared. You have engineers. You have many things. So this gives us a real competitive advantage, okay? So synergies is not only revenues. It's not only, what we would say -- as a second point. But also, it's about know-how."

So our idea is we think we can readapt the company and the same number of MUXs to another band with another frequency. And that makes sense. So when we expect this? This is not driven by Spain. This is not driven by Cellnex. It's driven by the European Union. And there've been thoughts about this, and we could think and it is stated by the European Commission clearly since 2020, 2022.

And as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained on the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed Excel file is available. Now please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. 
If you go to Slide 4, you can see that, today, we are presenting again a solid set of results that show a strong growth in terms of adjusted EBITDA and recurring level free cash flow per share when compared to the same period last year. We are also showing solid organic growth in our Telecom Site Rental business that confirms the market expectations for the period. We are delivering on our equity story by executing new accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy for international expansion. We successfully show a second bond, making the most of an attractive market environment, with the objective to stand maturities at very competitive terms. 
We are taking the further step to become the European leader in the distributed antenna system sector, whilst positioning Cellnex to capture potential opportunities associated with the future rollout of 5G. And finally, enough execution firepower is still available to continue growing, while maintaining our current credit rating for being eligible in the ECB program. 
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 3% when compared to December 2015, and even the number of DAS notes in Italy in just a very short period of time: 3 months. We are proactively analyzing new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe. We continue to pursue tower rationalization opportunities with our clients, and our first project is now ongoing. We are also accelerating our Build to Suit program, while additionally assessing the attractiveness to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers. 
In the broadcasting business, the return in [ph] process of 6 new TV channels was successfully completed with all private channels, generating revenues from the beginning of fiber [ph]. In the network services and other business, we continue to see a solid performance. I have signed 2 new contracts in the context of Smart Cities broadband connectivity in our mobility environment. 
Finally, we analyze any single opportunity we find to continue creating value for our shareholders. And such opportunities can be found by efficiently operating our business, improving our capital structure or proactively managing our working capital and taxes, which contribute to our strong recurrent levered free cash flow generation in the period. 
Turning to Slide #6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates and recent change of perimeter. We have managed to organically add almost 700 PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.58x. 
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the revenue's evolution in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see here how the existing asset base contributes with EUR 6 million of revenues to our consolidated figure, while the change of perimeter, mainly Galata and Protelindo, add EUR 58 million in that period. 
Moving now to consolidated adjusted EBITDA. You can see how the negative impact of the DTT simulcast that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect not seen in the year, is more than offset by the switch on of the new TV channels, the contribution of our organic growth and the change of perimeter. 
Let may now explain in detail on Slide 7 our recurrent levered free cash flow generation for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 88%, with the total figure increasing by 26% when compared to 2015. 
Looking at the revenues, the contribution from all the different businesses lines increased with a very well contained cost base, leading to adjusted EBITDA growth of 18% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx is below our guidance, but is expected to increase during the last quarter to reach more normalized levels. Our working capital change is positive for the period, but expected to be neutral at the year-end, in line with our guidance. 
Interests paid reflect our capital structure as of September, with a coupon associated with our first bond being paid in Q3. Taxes paid reflect implementation of tax management measures, as well as the schedule of tax payment due in the year. 
So as you can see, in Page 7, our revenues grow by 15%, our adjusted EBITDA grows 18% and recurring levered free cash flow grows even further at 26%. This is one of the key characteristics of Cellnex.  We can grow beyond our revenue growth. 
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex's leverage for the period has reached 3.7x net debt annualized EBITDA and is expected to reach 4.5x at year-end, including the closing of our recently announced acquisition, Shere. Our total borrowings, which are around EUR 1.3 billion with our 2 bonds accounting for all of our debt. When assessing the change in net debt, it needs to be taken into account M&A, interest payments and dividend distribution in the period. Please note that our next dividend payment will be submitted for approval at our Board of Directors meeting that will take place later in December. 
Moving to Slide 9. We have so far explained our debt position as of end of September. But given our recent developments, it is worth providing a more updated picture on our capital structure as of today. You can see on the left-hand side our current capital structure with new debt instruments, having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, allowing for additional debt associated with potential upcoming growth opportunities. 
Before, we have today a net debt position of EUR 1.47 billion, with additional debt available of around EUR 600 million. On the right-hand side, you can see our debt maturities profile and how it compares with our cash flow generation in cumulative terms, which shows how our cash flow generation covers future financing needs. 
In summary, we have a solid and long-term structure in place with no restrictions. We are, today, a current issuer with a strong market support, and we are committed with our solid credit rating in order to maintain the eligibility for the purchase program of the European Central Bank. 
Moving to Slide 10. The assumptions we have shared in previous periods behind our financial outlook for the full year 2016 are still valid. We provide in 2015 our recurrent levered free cash flow per share increase of 28%, and we're expecting in 2016 an increase of well above 20%. We are proud to show a consistent and significant increase of our key value creation metric over the years. Given our recent M&A activity, we believe it is worth again offering a quick update on our last deals, and also to provide additional insight on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 12, you can see a summary of recent activity, 261 towers from Protelindo, the acquisition of Commscon in Italy, an agreement with Bouygues to add up to 500 towers in France. And our recent acquisition of Shere Group which added to our already significant portfolio allow us to become one of the key players worldwide. 
These deals represent the initial steps into very attractive markets and allow us to achieve a more focused portfolio of services, ready to capture additional growth. Most importantly, this transaction allows us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating, and strengthen our relationship with a wider array of blue-chip clients, therefore, improving our business risk profile. 
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about cash flow generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion rate from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 70%. And the new deals are expected to generate EUR 27 million on a full year basis or, in other words, around 15% of the recurrent levered free cash flow generated in 2015. And all this has been achieved with an extremely efficient capital structure and by applying our strict investment criteria. 
On Slide 14 show more details on the Dutch operation of our last transaction. I would like to emphasize that we are consolidating our presence in the country, while improving our industrial profile by strengthening our relationship with clients. 
Also, in Slide 15, we offer a summary of our operations in the U.K. It is important to highlight that by acquiring Shere Group, Cellnex takes its first step into a country with a very strong economy, with the objective to continue identifying and executing new work opportunities and replicating, therefore, our successful international expansion strategy. 
And finally, Slide 17, just on closing remarks before opening for questions. Again, a solid set of results, showing strong financials and executed value accretive transactions. We have also issued our second bond in order to achieve even more efficient capital structure, first steps to becoming the European leader in the distributed antenna system. And finally, we still keep execution capacity to continue growing while improving our  business risk profile. 
So with this, I would like to open the line to answer your questions."

I have 3 questions, please. Yesterday, we had American Tower announce a joint venture with the Dutch pension fund, PGGM, where it's going to transfer its German operation into new vehicle and then sell the stake to PGGM. In my mind, this sends mixed signals around AMT's ambitions in Europe. On the one hand, it's a pullback. But at same time, it introduced what's probably an energized new partner for that business. So it'd be interesting to hear your perspective. Do you see M&A competition increasing from here? Secondly, I wanted to pick up on some of the financial problems RTVE is having in Spain. The local press has reported on the SCPI. Reporter says RTVE needs dramatic action to avoid failing. Is there any risk to your pricing power for multiplex capacity when that comes up for renewal? And then, lastly, turning to the Shere acquisition in the U.K. market. The U.K. market's quite unique in so much that it's perhaps the most progressive mobile network-sharing market of anywhere in Europe in the form of MBNL and CTIL. We have large and progressive quasi-independent tower companies. Given this unique market structure, how is the organic growth outlook in the U.K.? Any easier or any harder compared to your other markets? That was it."

And we -- it's not the first time that American Tower is in Europe, so it's not the first movement that -- they have been in Europe since 2012, the beginning. We have been competing with American Tower in -- I think in the main deals in Europe. So again, I think that American Tower is really interested in Europe. So -- and they are doing their strategy moves, movements and taking the position. But nothing new, to be honest, nothing new apart from that they are monetizing parts of their assets. But it remain interest -- and this, at the end of the day, reflects the main -- I mean, the attractiveness of the European market. I think that we have to go beyond on the fact -- if American Tower -- if there's -- all the leaders looking at Europe. If all this happens is because there is a value in this market. And Cellnex is a first mover here. So of course, and there will be more movement. So we are ready to work. We are ready to go beyond what is set up. As you said in the last question, U.K. market is a challenging market. Of course, it is. But also, they are very important opportunities -- DAS systems, no? And we have been very vocal here. We really believe we can -- we have something to say in this dynamic British market. And there are niches of opportunity that, of course, we are going to work out in detail. And it's now. And of course, there are sharing programs that are not [ph] worth sharing. But there are also opportunities maybe through organic growth, pure organic growth, not only the possibility to acquire towers. You talked about Radiotelevisión Española. Well, since year 2000, I think, Radiotelevisión Española has had programs. But I have not been able to see any different situation since then, to be honest. This is a public TV. You know the Spanish state, how it is performing for the bad and for the good, and is one of our main clients. And I can tell you something, we will be there to help and to work with our client so that we'll reach other ways with -- ask any other client, we win agreements. But we don't have this position being white or black. It's nothing new for us. It's our normal way of somehow reacting and working."

And then on top of that, we should be expecting the proportional portion of the money contribution within the year, which is in line with the magnitude we have raised with the market. And then in terms of network services and others, well, this is an area where, for example, we have trading, which is the sale of equipment, and that provides with some volatility in the performance quarter-on-quarter. So this is the explanation of the performance for the period. And finally, on France, bear in mind that we closed the first batch of towers at the beginning -- sorry, at the end of the period. So it's just a few days of contribution in the quarter. And also, the number of towers are, today, 113. And then we are also expecting the remaining part of the 230 batch will be contributing to our figures the moment we receive the waiver from our landlords. So that is expected to happen during the coming weeks, and that has nothing to do with the second batch of the agreement. So 230 that has already been closed, 113 that was already contributing, and we are expecting to integrate the remaining part of that state over the coming weeks."

What I want to ask was, in terms of your criteria in relation to acquisition targets, do you think that your, should we say, guidelines are more or less strict than to someone like American Tower who I understand has a global mandate to acquisitions? The second question is, do you believe that Cellnex might be a target for American Tower themselves, particularly in the context of the sizable stake that Alberta still retains in your company? And the third question is just on Italy. In terms of the net adds in the quarter, what proportion were actually from MNOs? And what proportion were attributable to fixed wireless players and things like that?"

And for me, it's difficult to answer, but I would try to give you my point of view, which is, yes, our point of view. I don't know who is more strict -- if American Tower or Cellnex, to be honest. For me, and as a CFO, it will be very difficult to estimate the risk in Nigeria. It's for me, it would be very difficult. So I don't know which data I could estimate. I don't know. I don't know how it can -- FX. So there are many things when comparing how strict from an M&A perspective we are. It's difficult to know exactly point-by-point. What I can tell you is that we are focused on long-term contracts. We are focused on reducing FX risk. We are focused on mature economies. And therefore, all these together defines M&A and some requirements, which has to be filled. So it's difficult to compare. It's my question -- my answer to that question. Your second question, which is about American Tower, well, again, we can be a target or not. It's something that should be answered by American Tower. What I can tell you is that the European market, even though it's mature, even though there is no FX raised and even though maybe inflation is not very high, even though everything seems to be interesting and there are lot of value to unlock. And again, Cellnex will be there to be the first to unlock this value for our shareholders. And then regarding Italy, maybe [indiscernible] you are better positioned than me to answer."

If there are opportunities to capture, obviously, we will be talking to them. So -- but in any case, it's not an opportunity to be materialized in the very short term, as the company has not even started commercial operations in the country. On the 4th operator awarding we've used in the presentation, that is linked to Iliad. And also, that is linked to MásMóvil in -- sorry, Iliad in Italy and MásMóvil in Spain.

We will be willing to offer our portfolio and try to capture organic growth from them. So we have specifically having in mind these 2 opportunities, both in Italy and in Spain. And your third question, rental cost, bear in mind that on the rents line in our P&L, it's not the [indiscernible] we have. We also have the expenses associated with our car fleet, satellite cost, connectivity cost if we use third-party fiber. So we believe our ground lease cost are pretty well contained.

But it's not because of new nodes or additional nodes being associated with specific MNOs, simply Commscon being able to generate business in new locations in the north of Italy. Then, on the economics of this business, we are still working on that in a sense that we are working on a group-wide business plan. So at some point in the short term, we will provide more color on how we see the economics of DAS business portfolio whole of the Cellnex Group. Bear in mind that the revenue per node might change depending on the involvement of the client on the development of the network. So if it's Commscon deploying the whole CapEx, we might be able to achieve higher revenue per node if the -- if any owner, for example, is willing to co-invest with Commscon also the associated fees of solo work. So we have a wider range of possibilities within this business model. Then on the pass-through, we are not providing the breakdown in terms of what is exactly the amount of pass-throughs coming on the annual accounts. We are giving that figure for the full year. Basically, bear in mind that in some cases, we don't have dedicated counters within some shelters. So it's a matter of negotiating with the customer on an operating basis, on the adjustments to be made on the pass-through cost associated with electricity. So it is true that in this case, in this quarter for Spain, there have been some adjustments to the star contributor to this revenue space. And this is why the performance for the quarter is flat, offsetting the pure organic growth generated in the given period. But you have to look at from an EBITDA perspective that the growth is coming because it is -- you cannot only see the revenues, you can see -- you have to see also the attached OpEx. So if you have this somehow split of revenues and cost associated, you would be able to see that the EBITDA is coming anyway."

The third, it's a bit big picture, but relates to your business model. This particular one, it's on Page 10. You show a breakdown in organic growth, in levered free cash flow putout that we could expect going forward for next year above 20%. Now if I do the numbers in terms of what we expect from the generation, from the new acquisition, it looks that through M&A, you should grow your -- levered free cash flow by around 14%. But of course, you do already the consolidated sum of this cash this year. So the question is, if you can give a breakdown for next year of this above 20% growth you expect on levered free cash flow, how much will be organic and how much will be through M&A for the acquisition you've already seen it? The second one, it's -- I'm going into the specifics of your number. In organic growth, the PoPs, you actually recorded the highest growth, both in Spain and in Italy. Now I remember during the IPO and afterwards, you guys have been passionate saying that the telco business model in Europe is new. We need time. We have to convince MNOs. But over time, we believe that it could be a ramp-up. Is this a ramp-up you believe is happening now or you're going to adjust the one-off and potentially go back to what we've seen in previous quarters? And the third one, it's a big picture, but because -- not in the sector adjustment, just on your business model. You're bidding for the towers that Antin is putting for sale. They actually mentioned during the call. But obviously, your chairman has been pretty vocal. Now early this year, you have been involved in the Inwit. And at that stage, you showed us that you were prepared to go to a gearing of almost 6x net EBITDA. Now, things do change in the credit market. Things do change in the market generally. So I was wondering if that 6x is still valid? And that's not the big -- the sort of your biggest modeled. I'm still wondering, do you really need to have a broadcasting business in Spain? Which sort of synergies do you basically extract? Of course, people can say that you've got a high tenancy ratio in Spain than in Italy, but that's because you bought a lot of ad covers from the JV. So I was just wondering, there could be, also going forward, the possibility of reviewing your business model and focusing more on tower rental rather than just on the average [ph] that you have at the moment and potentially see the broadcasting as a way to cash it in?"

Now in Page 10, what we said to you is not -- is what we expect for full year in 2016 and from accountancy -- accounting basis. So taking into account that one business will start generating EBITDA. For instance, Protelin",595,"Yes, the breakdown of the growth. Now in Page 10, what we said to you is not -- is what we expect for full year in 2016 and from accountancy -- accounting basis. So taking into account that one business will start generating EBITDA. For instance, Protelindo towers with a [indiscernible] are generating EBITDA for us since July 1. And maybe the French towers are starting to work since late September, and Shere Group will start to work since late October, something like that. So the thing is that, obviously, this -- when we talk here about over 20% when compared to 2015, broadly speaking, its minority feed belongs to organic growth. It does not belong to M&A, okay? So this is the first point. It's important to see this. And this is very linked to the follow -- one of the other questions you have raised, which was about a financing strategy, no? Financing strategy is not the same when you are maybe a company which is based in Spain and with win in Italy -- or in Italy with the Galata, sorry. And then you become more diversified with new clients and how we are trying to diversify or to increase our business risk profile. So this changed the metrics. And this changes the 6x, the 5x. It changed everything. So when you say we can raise to 6x, my answer is, yes, as long as our business risk profile increases. As long as from a credit perspective we can say, ""Okay. Even though the metric can be a little bit challenging, from a business risk profile, the company can support further leverage."" So the question is, if we reach 6x, how we'll deleverage later? We delevered enough more quickly a way than before? If the answer is yes, then the problem is not 6x. It's how you get to the new target in 2017, '18 or '19. So it's a little bit sophisticated more than before. So we can get to 6x, the answer is yes. It depends on the business risk profile and the delever -- the delevering profile of the company after the acquisition. So you have to be done on a base-by-base cases (sic) [case-by-case basis]. But the point here is we'll do the most efficient structure to protect our shareholders and also to be eligible because, today, being eligible has a value percent. What else? You raised the PoPs question, I don't know if it was the 2 -- the second or the third, but it was in the middle. PoPs question, yes, you are right when you said that at the moment of the IPO, we were saying that the PoPs growth was not going to be steady in time and was going to be leaner. The PoPs growth can have some jumps maybe. So we need some -- I don't know how you say it in English -- or choppy, I think you say that can be a little bumpy. Bumps. And that's true. However, also in different Q results, we have been vocal about this. Witnessing that 3% is a good level of growth in terms of PoPs. And the sources of this can be several. It can be, for instance, natural organic growth. So more multi-tenancy or can be, for instance, more commissioning. But if we think 3% is sustainable, and we'll have to fight for it as a company, at least. And then you were suggesting, to be honest, the last question for me was difficult to understand, to follow, so you can..."

Now that you actually still keep growing, and of course, there is limit up to how much the balance sheet could be geared up, consider that they -- what you said earlier. So I was wondering, first of all, what of sort synergies are we talking about to keep that broadcasting business in-house? And I said, I can see the high tenancy ratios you have in Spain, but most of them come from because you bought towers with already 2 tenants. So what else do we have to talk in terms of synergies? And second, do you think -- and obviously the big pictures. Do you think that the business will look like this within 5, 10 years, still a hybrid between broadcasting and tower site rental?

I mean, we are, as you can imagine, fully aware of this process. And this 700-megahertz suite of DAS has not -- it has not had direct implication on the number of MUXs. So our idea is we think we can readapt the company and the same number of MUXs to another band with another frequency. And that makes sense. So when we expect this? This is not driven by Spain. This is not driven by Cellnex. It's driven by the European Union. And there've been thoughts about this, and we could think and it is stated by the European Commission clearly since 2020, 2022. So nothing new in this part of the business. We don't think that changing the frequency must have an implication on the number of MUXs. Not at all."

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I [ really ] share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and showing a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is needs to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the Excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to buy up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we closed the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think will be a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino effect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to be place very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? Then last question on the Russian [ evasion ] process, and 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to during full year results. Could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will be some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the capital bonds program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to assess with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always on a very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today.

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with credit facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility into long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- [ underpin ] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract. But can we, with your approval, basically on a tower-to-tower basis potentially pass the contract to another operator? I mean, we're not talking about newcomers. Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years. But if they pay or if they negotiate with you, would you be willing to basically for them to sell the contract onto a third party?"

So yes, it is [indiscernible] I thought you were asking for [indiscernible]. But the answer is yes, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is [ tightening ] and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when we will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long period of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

The ones that will survive from hatch and the remaining win sites that they combine and they do allocate a set of site that will survive, let's say, from the merge synergy's final agreement.

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microwaves. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end but a mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental. And your last question, which I think is EBITDA growth of DAS, I think maybe Alex, you can help us a little bit here."

So as José Manuel was saying, Page 25 we try to explain a little bit how DAS work. There is one key element that makes those project, let's say, different project-by-project can be categorized in different type of projects. And then, of course, economics may change, especially in relation to the investment. So in many cases, if the venue owner who is limited of some investment, because it brings more [indiscernible] of the venue, because it is -- the owner of the big building that wants to [indiscernible] coverage, so as you can imagine, those projects where there is some CapEx already being deployed by the venue owner are different than the ones that we need to go through the MNOs, convincing them that it is worth to use some CapEx there and then get the critical mass to roll out the project with [indiscernible] and then other [indiscernible] and also having some sort of revenue share if there is one initial [indiscernible]. It is a mix of different models that, to be very honest, we are now understanding -- starting to understand  the complexity. And that's the reason that we acquired the company, which is very much specialized on that niche market. And the key element here is now to try to industrialize a little bit all those concepts and going beyond Italy or more than Italy where these company has been more or less having their commercial activity, going beyond on a difficult culture [indiscernible] try to adapt the model and being able to, let's say, achieve what we are [indiscernible] in the presentation to be a DAS leader operator in Europe.

As of today, some of those DAS elements the only way of being deployed are among in and of themselves. And sometimes, the [indiscernible], let's say, some time to market constraints. So we believe that being the independent player, we can catalyze and enable those projects in a faster way that until now we have somehow, let's say, delayed in time."

We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a distributed antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for every node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas. That is not -- it's different electronics, I don't know if I was clear myself. And what maybe your second question that I am not answering or did I answer everything?"

But maybe could you update us on any pressure you're seeing in the regional radio, other segments?"

As we try to explain in our documentation, it is a distributed antenna where the densification is something different. In terms of deployment, what we believe is that there is, as of today, an immediate need of DAS for densification. But small cells may come in ways a little bit further down the road, because that is quite also another type of equipment, small cells are still yet to be fully prepared by vendors in the full capacity of sharing among different MNOs. So we understand that there is that demand beyond Italy. And there -- it will come in other ways later on with the small cells. So we can differentiate slightly between these 2 technologies."

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I [ really ] share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and showing a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is needs to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the Excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to buy up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we closed the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think will be a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino effect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to be place very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year?

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will be some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the capital bonds program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to assess with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always on a very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have the broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital [indiscernible] than rest of the channels."

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with credit facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility into long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- [ underpin ] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract. But can we, with your approval, basically on a tower-to-tower basis potentially pass the contract to another operator? I mean, we're not talking about newcomers. Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years. But if they pay or if they negotiate with you, would you be willing to basically for them to sell the contract onto a third party?"

But the answer is yes, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is [ tightening ] and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when we will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long period of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

So from the merged entity, there will be a bunch of sites, which now belongs to Cellnex, and this is an important part of them. Then, there will be another 2 lots of sites. The ones that will survive from hatch and the remaining win sites that they combine and they do allocate a set of site that will survive, let's say, from the merge synergy's final agreement. And then there will be another bunch of sites that will be probably dispose or offered to Iliad because neither we, neither Hutch will be occupying them.

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably",617,"Just to complete the last one, I think there is an important issue maybe to emphasize. Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microwaves. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

Regarding your first question, which was the accretive impact of these acquisitions on recurring levered free cash flow. And the answer, I think we [indiscernible] we can go to base testing [indiscernible] you can see here, the EBITDA that on a ground rate basis we expect from this period for 2017. So -- and after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses. And therefore, after this EBITDA is converted into recurring levered free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14.5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end but a mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental. And your last question, which I think is EBITDA growth of DAS, I think maybe Alex, you can help us a little bit here."

So as José Manuel was saying, Page 25 we try to explain a little bit how DAS work. There is one key element that makes those project, let's say, different project-by-project can be categorized in different type of projects.

So in many cases, if the venue owner who is limited of some investment, because it brings more [indiscernible] of the venue, because it is -- the owner of the big building that wants to [indiscernible] coverage, so as you can imagine, those projects where there is some CapEx already being deployed by the venue owner are different than the ones that we need to go through the MNOs, convincing them that it is worth to use some CapEx there and then get the critical mass to roll out the project with [indiscernible] and then other [indiscernible] and also having some sort of revenue share if there is one initial [indiscernible]. It is a mix of different models that, to be very honest, we are now understanding -- starting to understand  the complexity.

We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a distributed antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for every node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas.

Also, what we foresee in those additional countries where we are is that there is, yes, a challenger that needs to rapidly deploy coverage and most likely trust to do on their own, because the grant-sharing agreement and growing an [indiscernible] revenue is easy. So for us, yes, it brings in additional opportunity that we are doing, let's say, [indiscernible] in order to capture."

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I [ really ] share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and showing a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is needs to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the Excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to buy up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we closed the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think will be a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino effect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to be place very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? Then last question on the Russian [ evasion ] process, and 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to during full year results. Could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will be some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the capital bonds program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to assess with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always on a very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that José Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have the broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital [indiscernible] than rest of the channels."

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with credit facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility into long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- [ underpin ] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract.

Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years.

But the answer is yes, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is [ tightening ] and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when we will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long period of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

Which I am [indiscernible] is that, José Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microwaves. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

Regarding your first question, which was the accretive impact of these acquisitions on recurring levered free cash flow. And the answer, I think we [indiscernible] we can go to base testing [indiscernible] you can see here, the EBITDA that on a ground rate basis we expect from this period for 2017. So -- and after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses. And therefore, after this EBITDA is converted into recurring levered free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14.5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end but a mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental.

We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a distributed antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for every node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas.

And then the 2,000 towers theme, again, I think that it was one of the questions of our colleague before. We were saying that this [indiscernible] tower we are working on a daily basis almost with different MNOs, and we are presenting our best alternatives to them. And we do think that eventually that -- no, that finally we'll get it, and we're doing good progress, even though slowly than expected. Why slowly?

Earlier this morning, we reported normalized funds from operations, or normalized FFO, of $0.45 per share for the third quarter, a decrease",1234,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. Earlier this morning, we reported normalized funds from operations, or normalized FFO, of $0.45 per share for the third quarter, a decrease of $0.01 per share year-over-year. This quarter was transitional for SNH as well as the industry as asset dispositions and industry trends negatively impacted the results. However, we expect that these dispositions and recent transitions will improve our portfolio's future results. In the third quarter, we continued to focus on adding value through internal growth, more efficient operations and attractive long-term financing. We believe investors appreciate and support our strategy as confirmed through the performance for our common stock, which has produced a total return of over 55% through the first 3 quarters of this year.
Highlights for the third quarter were that we grew consolidated same-property cash NOI by 2.1% year-over-year. In July, closed on a $620 million attract of a 10-year fixed-rate financing, allowing us to term out a majority of our outstanding volumes under our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We sold 4 medical office buildings and 1 skilled nursing facility for a total of $20.4 million, bringing our year-to-date total dispositions to approximately $30.2 million. We prepaid $92 million of mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6% per annum, and subsequent to the quarter-end, prepaid $42.5 million of mortgages at 6.5% per annum. Also, subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired one MOB for $18.5 million bringing our year-to-date total acquisitions to approximately $207 million. In addition, we agreed to acquire 2 private pay senior living communities for $18.6 million, which we believe -- which we expect will close by year-end. We did have some offsetting challenges, which we will discuss during the course of this call.
Our portfolio is comprised of well-diversified, private-pay focused health care real estate, which is designed to benefit from overall health care trends. In the third quarter, approximately 41% of our NOI was attributable to triple net leased senior living communities, 15% to manage senior living communities, 41% to medical office buildings and the remaining 3% to triple net leased to wellness center operators.
In the third quarter, we increased our total portfolio net operating income over the prior year by $2.3 million or 1.4%. This total NOI increase is related mainly to investment activities in each of our portfolio segments. The external growth in the triple net senior living portfolio is primarily result of the sale leaseback transaction to 7 senior living communities in June and was partially reduced by unfortunate defaults resulting in the transition to 2 triple net leased senior living communities to our managed senior living portfolio during the year. The impact of converting these triple net leased assets to managed assets was a decrease in our quarterly NOI of approximately $400,000 year-over-year. However, since the transition, the properties are now turning around and are well on their way to become stabilized and more profitable. In our MOB portfolio, our acquisition and disposition activities resulted in a net increase of $1.2 million in NOI year-over-year.
Now I'd like to discuss our results within each segment. Our triple net leased senior living portfolio continues to perform very well with same-store cash NOI increasing 1.9% year-over-year. The triple net senior living portfolio had a combined occupancy of 85.3% and rent coverage of 1.33x for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016. The coverage ratios of our leases remained strong and very consistent with prior quarters. We've seen occupancy impacted by new competition in certain markets within our lease portfolio. But our tenants responded by controlling products and increasing rates in markets where they can and investing the necessary capital in the communities to remain competitive. We continue to be comfortable with our tenants' ability to cover the rent due to us.
Our managed senior living portfolio same-store cash NOI decreased 2.9% year-over-year. Occupancy declined 60 basis points in the same-store portfolio over the prior year, but with a slight increase in total revenue. Declines in occupancy were more pronounced in the skilled nursing units within our CCRCs, with skilled nursing revenue was down just over $1 million this quarter over the prior year quarter. This is due to trends in Medicare reimbursement and growth of managed care programs, and several skilled nursing units were out of service during the quarter due to refurbishment. In fact, one community, the skilled nursing wing is being completely converted to assisted living and memory care units. We were pleased to see increases in independent assisted living revenues at our buildings, which more than offset the decrease in skilled nursing revenue. This increase demonstrates that our operators continue to push IL and AL rates, where they can, to combat nursing and other operating challenges.
Expenses were up on the same-store basis 1.3% year-over-year, primarily in employee benefit costs, real estate taxes and management fees. We continue to invest capital in and find opportunities to grow our managed senior living communities. Our operators are committed to increasing profitability during this time of increased competition through revenue-generating initiatives, controlling costs, investing in human capital and furthering the programming that makes them the providers of choice in our markets. We are encouraged that we have seen a meaningful increase in senses as we progress into the fourth quarter.
The medical office buildings, or MOB, portfolio remained well occupied this quarter with overall occupancy at the end of the third quarter of 95.9%. Occupancy in the same-store MOB portfolio increased 30 basis points to 96.3%. Same-store cash NOI increased 20 basis points year-over-year as a result of net leasing activity in the quarter, offset by slightly higher year-over-year nonrecoverable expenses.
Turning to our acquisition and disposition activities. Subsequent to quarter-end in October, we acquired one MOB in Ohio, occupied by a publicly traded medical device manufacturer, at an 8.25% cap rate for $18.5 million. And this acquisition brings our total acquisition volume to approximately $207 million year-to-date. We also agreed to acquire 2 private pay senior living communities in Illinois with 126 units for $18.6 million that will be triple net leased at initial rental rate of 7.5%. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close before year-end. In the third quarter, we sold 4 MOBs located in Oklahoma and 1 skilled nursing facility in Wisconsin for a total of $20.4 million. Our year-to-date dispositions' total is now $30.2 million, at an average cap rate of approximately 12%.
At September 30, we had one MOB located in Pennsylvania and one former memory care building at a senior living community located in Florida, classified as held for sale. The intention of our dispositions program is to enhance the overall asset quality of our portfolio and our internal growth potential going forward. While these dispositions will dilute in the short term, they achieved these 2 goals by pruning the portfolio of noncore assets. We continue to monitor the investment opportunities in the senior living and medical office markets and are being disciplined to maximize our risk-adjusted return. Acquisition activity for the foreseeable future will continue to be modest with individual properties and small portfolios, and funding expansion and improvement within our portfolio.
I'd like to now turn it back over to Rick to provide a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter."

These a",1074,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with what we were able to accomplish in the quarter to improve the quality of our portfolio and improve our financial position for the utilization of attractively priced long-term financing. These actions, along with the performance in each of our segments, resulted in normalized FFO of $105.7 million or $0.45 per share, a decrease of 2.2% compared to last year. We also declared a $0.39 per share dividend in October that will be distributed to shareholders on November 17, 2016.
Rental income for the quarter increased $6.6 million or 4.2% from the third quarter of last year to $165.5 million. This increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of 2 medical office buildings and 8 triple net leased senior living communities since July 1, 2015, partially offset by the sale of 5 skilled nursing facilities and 4 MOBs during the same period.
On a same-store basis, rental income increased $3.4 million or 2.2%. This increase was largely attributable to increased escalation income in our MOB portfolio as well as increases in rental income related to funding capital improvements at certain of our communities within our leased senior living portfolio. As a reminder, consistent with recent non-GAAP reporting guidance, we will recognize all the percentage rent related to our triple net leased senior living communities in the fourth quarter for both our GAAP and non-GAAP performance measures.
Residence fees and services revenue from our 68 managed senior living communities increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2015 to $98.5 million. This increase is primarily attributable to our acquisition of one managed senior living community and the 2 transitioned triple net leased properties into this portfolio, along with an increase of 1.1% in our average monthly rent to $4,208. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy from last year. The decline in occupancy was most pronounced in the skilled nursing units within our CCRCs, resulting in a decrease of over $1 million of revenue year-over-year. This decrease was partially attributable to beds being out of service as we continued to transform the units into higher-margin rehab-to-home units and partially attributable to changes caused by Medicare ACOs or managed care programs.
Property operating expenses from our MOBs and managed senior living communities increased 6.6% in the third quarter to a $103.3 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the acquisitions and the transition communities I just mentioned. On a consolidated same-store basis, property operating expenses increased $3.9 million. This increase was primarily attributable to increased employee health benefit costs and real estate taxes in our managed senior living communities and increases in operating expenses in our MOBs, particularly real estate taxes which were largely recoverable from our tenants.
General and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million or 17.4% to $12.1 million this quarter compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily as a result of increases in business management fees and stock-based compensation incurred in Q3 of 2016. Much of these increases are related to changes in the market price of our shares, which was up 53% year-to-date as of September 30, 2016. With G&A at 4.6% of revenues for the quarter, SNH continues to benefit from the efficiencies of our management structure and remains one of the more efficient companies in the health care REIT sector, particularly when considering the size of our portfolio.
We recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 related to 2 buildings. The first was a skilled nursing facility that was formerly leased to Five Star that was sold during the quarter and the second related to our planned disposition of a former memory care building out of managed senior living community that was classified as held for sale at September 30. We expect proceeds totaling approximately $5 million from the sale of these 2 properties classified as held for sale at the end of the quarter.
Interest expense increased 11.4% to $43.4 million this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase was a result of us closing the $620 million, 10-year, interest-only secured financing in July, along with a $200 million term loan closed in September of 2015 and the $250 million 30-year senior notes issued in February of 2016. These increases were partially offset by the repayments of $250 million of our senior notes in November of 2015 and a $168 million of mortgages that had encumbered 6 of our properties at an average interest rate of 5.72% since July 1, 2015. The July financing shared by 2 Class A life science buildings located in Boston's Seaport District allowed us to term out the majority of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At the end of October of 2016, we prepaid another $42.5 million of mortgages that had encumbered 8 more of our properties at an average interest rate of 6.54%. We recognized $659,000 of dividend income from our equity investment in the RMR Group during the quarter. We expect dividend income to run at this amount per quarter going forward for the foreseeable future. In the third quarter, we invested $5.3 million into revenue-producing capital improvements at our triple net leased senior living communities for which we will earn an 8% return on the amount funded.
Our recurring capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $12.2 million and included $3.8 million that are MOBs for building improvements, $3.9 million on MOB tenant improvements and leasing costs, and $4.5 million at our managed senior living communities. We also spent $7.4 million on development and redevelopment capital projects, with a vast majority of it being spent at our managed senior living communities. These projects include major renovations intended to reposition the property in its market or give our communities a competitive advantage against new supply that we see entering the market. At September 30, 2016, we had $40.8 million of cash on hand and $785 million available on our $1 billion revolver.
Our total debt to gross assets at the end of the third quarter was 42.9%, and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 6.0x on a trailing 12-month basis. We are comfortable with our leverage ratios where they are given the quality of our portfolio and the significant amount of liquidity we have available to us.
I will now turn the call back over to our operator to open it up for questions."

I think it's important to remember that Five Star leases all have cross default provisions, there's corporate guarantee in place. They're all backstopped by the real estate that Five Star owns and operates on its own account. So we really think about it as consolidated coverage, which is the same way we think about Sunrise, which also has 4 leases with us. So this quarter, we would've had to added -- we would've had to add a fifth line for that new master lease for the leaseback transaction we just did. And it would've only had 2 days of activity in it. It just didn't make a lot of sense. So we sat back and said, ""Okay, we should just simplify this presentation and report it as a consolidated number."" It's more meaningful to us that way, and we don't really think breaking up the detail added much to users of our financial statements either. I don't have the detail in front of me, but I can say -- I mean, the number just ticked up a little bit on a consolidated basis. I don't think any of the leases moved significantly. I think had we presented in detail, the fifth lease would've looked a little funny because it was 2 days of prorated activity. But overall, we're still comfortable with Five Star's coverage where it is at 1.23x."

And what we -- this quarter, we had a drop in revenue of over a $1 million in Medicare A inpatient revenue, primarily from those types of communities. I said some of it is due to new refurbishments going on at a number of communities but also at significant pace, particularly in Florida, is lost revenue due to managed care programs. So really the private pay senior living side has actually done very well during this quarter. And as we mentioned in Q4 to date, we are seeing a noticeable improvement in senses. So a number of programs that have been implemented over the last couple of quarters, we believe, are bearing fruit, and I'd say our properties are doing, on the senior living side, pretty well."

We mentioned in our prepared remarks that real estate taxes impacted both senior living and our MOB portfolio. Real estate taxes in total were up about $2 million year-over-year, and a lot of it on the MOB side is recoverable, but unmanaged side, one other things we noticed is that the timing of our real estate tax appeals tends to move the needle on -- talking about a portfolio of 65 assets. We also, in the managed senior living business, saw increased health benefits costs this quarter, largely a function of a small number of extraordinarily high individual claims that wind up increasing overall costs beyond what we normally see. These costs were up about $800,000 this quarter compared to last year. So to your point, I mean the operators did a great job offsetting a lot of it through labor efficiencies and trying to manage overtime through the vacation season, but definitely had an impact on our results. On a go-forward basis, I don't think we see a ton of structural changes. I think -- you know the more you focus on managing labor and focusing on supply chain efforts, the more momentum that effort gets and I think, it will continue and become cultural, and we are hopeful to continue to see savings and growth and NOI there. But I think, we've generally talked about targets of 3% to 5% growth in the managed business and think that's probably still appropriate. But again, there certainly has been some headwinds with both competition and, again, a couple of these unique operating expense issues."

So we've now switched back to paying fees based on historical costs, which has an increase in our G&A. Also because of our management structure, our share based comp is predominantly issued to nonemployees because they are employees of RMR. And as a result of issuing shares to nonemployees, we actually recognize expense based on the vesting date share value, not the grant date share value, like most companied would.

And please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of the period. We are in Page 4. Here, you can see that today, we're presenting again a solid set of results that confirm the market expectations for the period. We have also resume our M&A activity by executing 2 value-accretive deals, while establishing our presence in very dynamic markets. We are best positioned candidate to consolidate the European tower landscape. We're also taking the first steps to become the European leader in the distributed antenna systems sector.
From operations perspective, our efficiency plan is on track, while we have also recovered TV revenues we lost in the past. And finally, we are glad to announce that Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35 Index.
Moving now to Slide 5. In terms of activities, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 2% compared to December 2015. We are also paving the way to boost our presence in the DAS business by acquiring CommsCon. CommsCon provides today DAS services in 83 locations in Italy and is analyzing many additional projects in environments where an important demand for mobile data is seen. We continue to assess the possibility to invest in fiber backhauling to the tower for our customers, and we are making good progress on this front. We're closely monitoring and proactively analyzing potential new opportunities that might arise from the consolidation of the fourth mobile operator role across Europe.
Finally, we continue to pursue rationalization projects with mobile operators, and we are working hard to reach an agreement in the short term.
Regarding broadcasting, we can confirm that the retendering process of the 6 new TV channels have successfully been completed with all Chinese broadcasting and generating earnings from April, thus, providing a stable revenue release, going forward.
Regarding the network services and others, we continue to see a solid performance, faster connectivity and emergency communications businesses. It is important to highlight that we -- that when we enter any country, we pursue new services levering on our Telecom Site Rental activity.
Finally, we keep analyzing any single opportunity at hand to continue creating value for our shareholders. And one such opportunity is our efficiency program, on which we are making good progress according to the timing I [ really ] share with you.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see here the evolution of PoPs and our resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases being explained by consistent organic growth rates. We have managed to add more than 400 PoPs in the period reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.56, a 4% increase when compared to June 2015 and a 2% increase when compared to December 2015.
On the next chart, you can find a comprehensive explanation of the performance of revenues in the Telecom Site Rental business. You can see how the shifting asset base contributes EUR 4 million to our consolidated figures, while the change of perimeter adds EUR 54 million in this period.
When we've not adjusted EBITDA, you can see how the negative impact of the DTT single cut that took place in 2015, which was a one-off positive effect, is more than offset by the switch on our new TV channels, the change of perimeter and the contribution of organic growth, which represent EUR 4 million in the period.
Let me now explain in detail on Slide 7, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into current level free cash flow in the period has been 94%, with current cash flow increasing by 24%.
Looking now to revenues. Telecom Site Rental increases mainly due to our strong organic growth and acquisitions. The broadcasting business reflects now the new TV channels from April when compared to the previous quarter. And network services and other continue showing a solid performance, mainly due to a high activity in the connectivity business.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase is mainly due to cost directly associated with our recent transactions. Our adjusted EBITDA reached EUR 134 million, in line with our guidance for the full year, and showing a strong 17% increase when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is well below our 3% guidance for the year, due to a time effect and is expected to catch up within this year to reach a more normalized level.
Our working capital change is neutral for the period, thanks to our strict management, and in line with our full year guidance.
Interest paid reflect our current capital structure with the first coupon associated with our bond paid this week, therefore, to be considered for the next quarter. And tax paid reflect the implementation of tax management measure as well as the tax payment scheduled in the year.
Non-M&A expansion CapEx include the first step of our efficiency program with EUR 12 million associated with cash advances in the context or the renegotiation of our leases.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 8. Cellnex leverage has decreased to 3.3x net debt annualized EBITDA, well below our long-term objective of 4x. Our total net debt is EUR 872 million, with our bond accounting for most of the debt. We're now setting the change in net debt and is needs to be taken into account. That in general, we paid the second tranche of Volta Extended phase 2. And in June, we paid acquisition of CommsCon. You will find all these details in the Excel sheet that is in our website. 
We have also paid our final dividend in July, bringing the total distribution to around EUR 20 million, approximately 20% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in the second half of 2015, in accordance with our dividend policy.
Coming back to the remaining lines of our income statement, depreciation and amortization credits increased mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions. And interest expense increased in line with our capital structure.
Moving to Slide 9. You can see on the left-hand side our capital structure, with near liquidity lines having been signed at a very competitive cost of around 1%, alone for new upcoming growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side, you can see also our debt maturities profile compared to our cash flow generation in a cumulative basis. We can, therefore, in summary, say that we face no refinancing risk due to the long-term [indiscernible] of our debt and our cash flow generation capacity. We have improved our liquidity position. And we have a solid credit rating with our Standard & Poor's outlook having been improved recently. On that, our recent acquisition have been financed at a very low marginal cost.
So now regarding the M&A update. Given our high M&A activity, during the last weeks, we believe it is worth offering a brief recap of our last year's and also provide some additional background on how these transactions fit into our equity story. 
If we now move to Slide 11. You can see a summary of our recent activity. 251 towers in Holland. An agreement with Bouygues to buy up to 500 towers in France and acquisition of Commscon in Italy. These deals represent the first step into very dynamic market. They allow us to diversify into countries with a strong credit rating. Hopefully, next, the right platform from which continue to assess and [indiscernible] consolidation opportunities, and therefore, confirm the delivery on our equity story.
On Slide 12, you can see a picture of a new Cellnex perimeter as a result of the recent transactions. More markets, more diversified client base, more focused portfolio on Telecom Site Rental revenues. All-in-all, we can clearly state that after these appreciations, our business risk profile has improved.
Moving to Slide 13. You can see here a table that shows how to think about capital generation from our recent acquisition. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is 85%. So I think this figure is very, very high. The new deals are expected to generate EUR 12 million on a full year basis in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. This represents around 10% of the recurring cash flow generated in the first semester 2016, and all this has been achieved always by applying our strict investment criteria.
So now if we assess the different opportunities one after the other, first of all, on Slide 14, you can see a more detailed assessment of our DAS deal that we closed the first day of July. The main idea I would like to highlight is that we are entering a new market with a strong anchor tenant, providing with revenues visibility, and we follow on opportunities that should come in the next quarter. 
Also, there are other characteristics of this deal, such as the high proportion of revenues guaranteed with new clients, in this case, KPN, until 2017, 2018. The tariff scheme, which is in Brexit to CPI having a flow at 0%.
And finally, I would like to say that 20% of the sites that we've acquired overlaps with existing networks of our operators.
On the Slide 16 -- sorry, 15. Here, we present the French opportunity, and this project is an industrial project that sets the foundation for a long-term partnership with a key European player, like Bouygues. One example of this future cooperation is our preemptive right to build up to 250 sites for our anchor tenant. It is important to highlight that this acquisition, unlike the Dutch one, consist on the acquisition of assets of towers. Also, there are other characteristics that make this opportunity unique, such as a very long-term contract of 20 years and also a 2% annual fix fee escalator.
Moving now to Italy on Slide 16. The acquisition of CommsCon represents the opportunity for Cellnex to become the DAS benchmark in Europe. We believe the DAS market has a huge potential and will position Cellnex in the future DAS sector as it is developed. This acquisition provides us with a first-mover advantage and the knowhow required to achieve this leadership. We do really think that CommsCon is a unique platform to capture what we think will be a very significant market in the next years.
At the end of the day, CommsCon will help us to cover -- or to improve the coverage that we can provide from our infrastructures.
Finally, on Slide 17, we present what we call the domino effect, the strategy that we have been implementing for our European expansion. Our intention is to continue acquiring small portfolios in new countries so that we can increase our understanding of the market, build a strong relationship with the aim to continue consolidated [indiscernible] market by pursuing new opportunities. This is what we have successfully done in the past, and is a path that we would follow in order to become the European consolidator.
In Slide 19, just some closing remarks. We are presenting today a solid set of results. We are happy to deliver our equity story, not only from a revenue perspective but also from M&A activity. We continued to be place very well position to consolidate the European tower landscape. We are taking the first step to become the European leader in the new technologies at a step-by-step far more important like the DAS. Current operations are strong, and our efficiency plan is on track. And finally, Cellnex has been included in the IBEX 35. It has already improved the visibility, the liquidity and attractiveness of our store, as you can see in Page 20."

What is your view, the critical portfolio size, you would like to achieve? And if you could give a bit of guidance on time frame you think you will need to achieve the optimal portfolio size? And then maybe something on an update on the Hutchison portfolio in Italy? That's first question. Second, an OpEx, I understand you could roughly save EUR 50 million from these negotiations over the next 3 to 4 years. Now my question is, how much of that amount do you expect to achieve this year? Then last question on the Russian [ evasion ] process, and 2,000 towers decommissioning you guided to during full year results. Could you give some update on that?"

Regarding your first question, which was France, Holland and the next steps and time frame. In fact, I think in page -- in the annex in Page 22, you can find the market description of the Netherlands and France. And you can see how, for instance, in the Netherlands, there are different tower costs. And there's a footnote that is displaying which tower cost there are there. So we are talking at least 1,200 towers from Tower Company. And on top of that, there are other MNOs that have already, let's say, 13,000 towers. We will think that the market is moving, and there will be some angle to consolidate in the next quarter.
Again, the question is always execution versus value criterion. We have to give you an answer regarding when it is very important to understand the criteria's requirement. So it's not easy to tell you. The thing is, we are working on that. We are monitoring this market pretty closely. Also, the French market, French market, again, in Page 22, you can see that there are different MNOs with, let's say, around 50,000 towers. And some TowerCos with 10,000 towers. You all know and it is market -- it is public information that some of these TowerCos potentially may be on sale in the next quarter in competitive process from a public perspective, we can say that, at least. There will be one opportunity in France, hopefully. Your second question was regarding the OpEx. In fact, you were asking about the capital bonds program that we have. First of all, let me tell you that the capital bonds program is working as expected. And we're pretty sure we can get this EUR 15 million by 2019, I think, it was the target. This year, I think that if we go on investing as we are investing around EUR 3 million, EUR 2 million, let's say, EUR 2 million or EUR 3 million depending the timing effect can be obtained. Please be aware that this is, if you invest 1 year, for instance, EUR 20 million in cash advance, it's not the same investing this EUR 20 million at first day of the year or the last date of the year. So it depends. At this time frame have an impact on 2015 numbers. However, all these transactions always follow our very strict criteria. So the payback will there, if not this year, next year. Finally, regarding the consolidation of the market, the 2,000 towers [indiscernible] this month, again, same message as previous quarters. I think we are working a lot and I'm pretty sure that we will present to you an interesting deal. The thing is that each day longer than expected, to be honest. However, it is taking longer because also I don't think that Cellnex is opening this market and providing very good ideas and new angles that have to be explored. Pretty sure that we will come out one day to the market with something positive. Or at least you will see quarter-by-quarter that the number of towers change, and therefore, the PoPs grow, right?"

Starting in Italy, as we consider the implications of Italian MNO consolidation, it would be good to progress the debate from the organic growth opportunities of new entrants to now better understanding, in your view, what your P&L is, as an industrial partner as Iliad relative to your competition in Italy? And staying in Italy, I really have an extension of the previous question. As we look at the accelerated investments announced earlier this week by Inwit, it's clear that TI is probably now not a seller of that state, so given M&A is off the table and also given Inwit is investing to drive growth, do you have any reason to change your capital allocation in Italy? And lastly, on spectrum, at the end of May, we saw the GSMA again pushed for a more aggressive time line for the reconsideration of the sub-700 megahertz band for alternative uses. It'd be interesting to hear your perspective on this development? And how this shift is debated at all for the outlook, for DTT in the sub-700 megahertz band, if at all?"

Giles, I think, your first and second question, I think both come at the same time. We are not going to change our plan because of our peer is changing their CapEx plan. I mean, we will have to go on working, following our internal targets with a criteria we have in order to create value for our shareholders. We think that the Italian market, from my perspective, presents a lot of opportunities, one of them being the fourth operator. Obviously, Cellnex is keeping twice on this process, and I think we have the open to assess with different candidates in this opportunity. I think that Cellnex is very well positioned. Cellnex has, let's say, a tenancy ratio in Italy which is 1.2x. So it gives us headroom to grow, give us headroom to put more tenants into our towers as a place now that Italy presents a very demanding electromagnetic revolution. So in this case, having a low tenancy ratio is helpful to grow, is helpful to offer new PoPs. And second, also, I don't think that we are very well positioned to play a key role in this fourth operator and process because we are neutral operator. We are independent tower company, so we do not have any MNO on our shareholding base, and therefore, it will give us headroom, will give us flexibility to treat all our customers in the same way with the same criteria. So I do think that Cellnex is doing -- working -- doing good progress, but always on a very confidential basis and on a very prudent basis, step-by-step. I don't know if Alex Mestre, you can help me to answer the third question."

On relation to the spectrum, I think it's true that the 700 megahertz is something that the World Radio Conference is also [indiscernible] that at certain point in time, it is required to do a reallocation of the usage of the band. Remember, like remember, we have the 800 megahertz has already been cleared and now is being used for 4G. Also, I would like to emphasize the concept of the lower the frequencies, the longer the range. So I believe that when an MNO is looking for identification, using -- traveling more kind of a small cells, more microcells, more DAS that Jos Manuel has been explaining in one of the trends as of now. Those frequencies are less interesting because the coverage is much wider than higher frequency. So in relation, identification in the lower frequencies are not as useful as the higher frequencies. In relation to the 700 megahertz, it is clear that the number of stages in Europe have to prepare their clients. This is something that will occur during -- in 2017. Some of the countries have an accelerated plan in relation to that, but when research that in countries like Spain, and as a result also of the latest, let's say, prepositions which is having, in Europe, we understood that it is not going to happen before 2022. And it is the period that has been the frequency rate possible, also within 2020, 2022. And, importantly, during that process and that time, until then, the broadcasting terminologies that will evolve, is able to do an evolution. It will be maybe [indiscernible] visibility to higher compression mechanisms that will keep the overall offer of channels, even migrating them to high definition, very equal as we have today. So in that sense, we expect that in those countries, specifically in Spain, where we have the broadcasting presence as of today, we will remain with a similar offer in terms of digital [indiscernible] than rest of the channels."

You mentioned that there should be a follow-up deal for the 270 towers. Do you also think that we have similar terms in terms of length and EBITDA contribution. The second one is on credit. You show in the appendix, a chart, where it looks like the yield on your bond gradually falling for a number of regions. And so my question is, considering you still finance yourself with credit facility, there would be no time now to turn that short- to medium-term credit facility into long-term bond? The third is on CommsCon. Now it's a slightly different -- this is broader than what we've seen in previous deals. The other deals you've got a lot of clarity in terms of the length, and therefore, it's easier to model from our standpoint. Here today, you showed a contribution around EUR 1.5 million on EBITDA. So the question is how secure is EBITDA? What sort of length in the contract we got behind? And what are the ultimate payers for that particular -- [ underpin ] that EBITDA and then also third party? And the very last one, and that one, it's a small [indiscernible] than everything else. We talk a lot about this [indiscernible] a lot of contract and the fact that WIND cannot get half of that contract.

Of course, nothing at WIND and Hutchison had complete their business plan in terms of the towers they want to get out. But in case they basically they try that, for them, it will be good to get out of some of the towers in which they sold to you, and of course, they locked for 15 years.

But the answer is yes, this 500 towers are coherent in terms of the relationship between the EBITDA contribution and then the [indiscernible] value required by the [indiscernible]. So the second question talks about Page 23. Of course, you know, Ottavio, that personally, I monitor the market on a daily basis and [indiscernible] every step you can see how the green line is [ tightening ] and is getting more nearer now to our benchmark. And just, of course, I think that Cellnex has to keep an eye on it, and as soon as the market might be open or might be one in an attractive condition for us because of the market is open. So now it is a question of [indiscernible], a question of when we will be, for sure, really to fund the company not because we need it because we [indiscernible] need it. I mean, we are not in a rush. But just on opportunistic basis to capture maybe a bond, a long-term bond that allow us to look at low interest rate for a very long term, and therefore, be more value accretive when we acquire a company. So yes, the answer is yes, we are monitoring the market. Also, your third question was regarding CommsCon. So in order to answer that question may be we can go to Page 25. So in Page 25, we will have to try to represent a little bit business model of CommsCon now. And there are 3 boxes: venue owners; Cellnex, where we do with CommsCon now; and our customers. If you follow this graph, you will see that Cellnex pays a rental fee to the venue owner, to make it very simple. And Cellnex deploys CapEx and incurs the OpEx of managing the system. And as a consequence of this, we receive money, a fee by the MNO. So obviously, the EUR 1.5 million EBITDA, how sustainable it is? We'll think it is sustainable. We'll think it is going to grow in the future. And look at something here. The fees that they may not pay to us has 2 parts. The first part is stagnant -- initially stagnant or after the consideration for the infrastructure that will build up for the system. And second, we'll receive different installments for a long period of time, so enough from consolidation and then long-term payments. Therefore, we'll think that this EUR 1.5 million is sustainable and as the market develops -- because in Europe, the opportunity is massive. All of us would have gone to put a very simple example. In London, now when you go London Lounge and maybe you have progress in order to send a WhatsApp in order to go on with a conversation. And so as this situation in London, there are many other situation in Europe. And we think that with CommsCon, we are very well placed in order to improve this coverage and to fill in these gaps. And finally, the fourth question, maybe Alex you can help me. Already, Ottavio, you can repeat it, because -- but I don't know, I mean, Alex as you wish."

The ones that will survive from hatch and the remaining win sites that they combine and they do allocate a set of site that will survive, let's say, from the merge synergy's final agreement.

So probably th",617,"Just to complete the last one, I think there is an important issue maybe to emphasize. Which I am [indiscernible] is that, Jos Manuel, that have not been disposing towers, there is still, I believe, that tower is a critical technical asset. So probably the first department that has to be convinced in order to go in this direction that financially could make sense  is the technical department. Then we speak the technical language. And as industrial player, for us, it's not difficult, let's say, to tune the frequencies, because we talk about frequencies -- keeping the frequencies with our counterparties in the technical departments of [indiscernible] it can establish a comfort, let's say, discussion that could, let's say, lower those entry barriers that maybe is another type of potential where you're more financially responsible, another kind of interested party to either towers could be a little bit more difficult. So we believe that as industry player, we have essential technical advantage there on having this technical-to-technical discussion. On your first question, which was these mobile backhaul. Yes, this is true. So densification, more technologies in a single tower means more bandwidth. And more frequencies per tower means more bandwidth to be delivered to each tower. Then normally, this is done by Microwaves. So radio links, there is no fiber. However, the demand of these more bandwidth requires, in many cases, to substitute the radio links with fiber. And this is a process where all of the MNOs are as of today investing or continuing to invest in the coming years. Specifically, we were allowed to offer 4G, [indiscernible] that requirement are much more demanding. Our interest there is because we believe that this backhaul can be neutralized. So there is no strategic advantage, let's say, on that. And the fact of having a CapEx that could be neutralized it is very much what is our business about. And our intention is to stay at the dark fiber level. So it means we are not intending to enter into optical electronics, into connectivity, which sometimes changes a little the profile of the operation and maintenance of this type of agreement. So we intend to stay on the dark fiber, let's say, layer of value proposition to the MNOs. And in relation to the economics, this may be very different on depending where the tower is, as you can imagine, and how far is the main backhaul is far from the tower, because then you need to do some sort of construction to build from the backbone to the tower some CapEx there, could be 30 meters, could be 3 kilometers. So that, as you can imagine, is going to depend very, very much. And the idea is to understand the needs of the MNOs. In Italy, we have around 15% of our towers with fiber, so there is [indiscernible] very, very clear. And now with the new MNO potential, this neutralization effect that we were mentioning is much more obvious. So we believe that the opportunities are clearly there. There is a small budget that we're doing in Italy on that in the range of, let's say, dozens of towers to put fiber on our side. This is helping us to understand also the retail economy [indiscernible] the complexity of doing that. Based on that, we will, let's say, take a more stern step towards putting fiber to our towers. We see the fiber to the towers like the roots of a tree. When you have these roots, it's more difficult to move the tower. So also in terms of long-term sustainability of the contracts, we believe that it's also bringing value on the top of that."

Regarding your first question, which was the accretive impact of these acquisitions on recurring levered free cash flow. And the answer, I think we [indiscernible] we can go to base testing [indiscernible] you can see here, the EBITDA that on a ground rate basis we expect from this period for 2017. So -- and after that, we deduct the maintenance CapEx, the taxes, the working capital, the interest expenses. And therefore, after this EBITDA is converted into recurring levered free cash flow, so the thing is that out of these EUR 14.5 million of EBITDA that we are acquiring, we convert into cash flow for our shareholders EUR 12 million. So we do think that it is a very high conversion ratio. And we can't do that, because we have a very strict policy in terms of maintenance CapEx and working capital. And we do -- we try -- we structure all the transactions in a way that from a DAS perspective, we can be competitive. And also as we were speaking before, from an interest expense perspective, we are opportunistic and we take advantage to fund these transactions in a very competitive way. So the answer is yes, these transactions are accretive from day 1, so we don't have to wait 2 or 3 years to see the cash flow per share to be increased. 2017 and even 2016, the recurring levered free cash flow per share will be increased because of these transactions. Your second question will be -- if I recall, it was regarding M&A, when M&A is considering telco broadcasting opportunities altogether. As you can read in our IOM and also in the [indiscernible], you will see that we clearly state that our objective is to step by step increase our exposure to Telecom Site Rental. It is true that also if in order to do so we have to acquire broadcasting, we might assess the opportunity. But that will not be an end but a mean to get what we want on which we are focused, which is the Telecom Site Rental business. So this is the reality, focus on Telecom Site Rental. And your last question, which I think is EBITDA growth of DAS, I think maybe Alex, you can help us a little bit here."

There is one key element that makes those project, let's say, different project-by-project can be categorized in different type of projects.

So in many cases, if the venue owner who is limited of some investment, because it brings more [indiscernible] of the venue, because it is -- the owner of the big building that wants to [indiscernible] coverage, so as you can imagine, those projects where there is some CapEx already being deployed by the venue owner are different than the ones that we need to go through the MNOs, convincing them that it is worth to use some CapEx there and then get the critical mass to roll out the project with [indiscernible] and then other [indiscernible] and also having some sort of revenue share if there is one initial [indiscernible]. It is a mix of different models that, to be very honest, we are now understanding -- starting to understand  the complexity.

And the key element here is now to try to industrialize a little bit all those concepts and going beyond Italy or more than Italy where these company has been more or less having their commercial activity, going beyond on a difficult culture [indiscernible] try to adapt the model and being able to, let's say, achieve what we are [indiscernible] in the presentation to be a DAS leader operator in Europe.

We do not deploy the base station, so the [indiscernible] architecture, and if you go to Page 25, it is clear on the central picture. And still you see that on the left side of the central picture, there are a few equipments, those are the DTS. So the equipment -- typical equipment that goes into the tower is this one, the one which is on the left, which is the #1, #2 and #3. This -- CapEx in this period from the MNO. So we are not entering, let's say, on to the active equipment at the complexity of a base station. What we do is this DTH [indiscernible] and the nodes and the fiber, we get the signal and the acronym tries to explain what it is. It is a distributed antenna. So we get the signal from DTS and we spread it through a wide coverage area. Instead of having 1 antenna each, for every node we put 10 to 15 antennas. That's the reason that as of today we have something like 900, almost 1,000 nodes, and every node is having 10 to 12 antennas. That's the reason we have up to 12,000 antennas in those systems overall as of today coming from the CommsCon acquisition. So the complexity of sharing the antenna is much less than the complexity of sharing the active agreement. Which then becomes a rank sharing sort of asking. So here, we are not talking about sharing the radio station, we just sharing a distributed antenna which being difficult to deploy in a venue like a stadium, for the [indiscernible] is probably the best way to do it or the only way is to do by sharing. That's the reason that most of the DAS systems as of today are starting from a shared system among different [indiscernible]. But they need to agree amongst themselves to do that. And maybe one has more intelligent in one area, the other in the other, so acting as an enabler of that process makes the situation easier, and where we believe we can get, let's say, an expansion of that business model to other areas.
