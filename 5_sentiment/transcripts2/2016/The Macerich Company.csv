If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean. 
The fourth quarter reflected continued operational excellence as evidenced by the strength of our key operating metrics. We saw the successful completion of our joint venture strategy, the completion of a number of highly attractive financings, the reinvestment of capital into our best assets through redevelopment and share buybacks. We'll talk about these in greater detail later in the call. 
We continue to see very significant benefit from our efforts in 2012 through 2015 to sell noncore, slower-growing assets and redeploying that capital into higher-quality, more productive assets. 
Looking at the leasing activity. We did volume in the fourth quarter, we signed leases under 10,000 square feet. We had 313,000 square feet signed. Positive re-leasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of 14.2%. 
Looking at mall occupancy. It came in at 96.1%, up 30 basis points from 12/31 of '14, above [ph] 70 basis points from our occupancy level at the end of the third quarter. Average mall store base rents also increased to 54 32 up from 51 15 a year ago. 
FFO for the quarter came in at $1.12. That compared to $0.99 for the quarter-end December 31, 2014. Same-center NOI increased by 6.4% in the quarter. And year-to-date NOI -- same-center NOI growth was a sector-leading 6.5%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
Looking at the gross margin at the centers. It improved to 71% for the quarter, up from 68.6% in the fourth quarter last year. Looking at the year-to-date, margin improved by 250 basis points to 69.3% compared to 66.8% for the full year 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was up slightly at $1 million, comparing to $800,000 in the fourth quarter last year. The average interest rate, 3.6%, was slightly higher than the 3.48% average rate at the end of 2014. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, looking at the key balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap was 34%. Interest coverage ratio was a very strong 4.0x. Debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x. The average debt maturity, and this is after the Arrowhead financing and the closing of the joint venture to 6 years, up significantly from a few years ago. We did a total of about $3 billion in financing in 2015. And within the past quarter, we did $1.8 billion. It included Arrowhead 12-year loan, $400 million at 4.05%; los Cerritos, another 12-year loan at 4%; Washington Square, $550 million loan, 3.65%, 7 years; South Plains, Twenty Ninth Street, also refinanced. So that was $1.825 billion in financings. Average tenure of 10.1 years and average interest rate of 3.94%. 
In mid-November, we set about to execute on our $1.2 billion of approved share buyback. We engaged an investment bank to do a $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program. At the beginning of that program, we received and retired 4.1 million shares, when the plan started, which was November 13, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered based on the average daily volume adjusted price of MAC during the buying period, less negotiated discount. 
On January 20, 2016, the ASR program was completed. Effectively, MAC bought back $400 million worth of shares at $78.26. We received another 971,000 shares at that time. So this program, the first ASR under the $1.2 billion program, retired a total of 5.1 million shares. 
Also, since the last call, we had 2 special dividends that resulted from the joint venture transactions. They were each up $2. One was paid in December and one in January. 
In our press release this morning, we provide 2016 FFO per share guidance. The range was $4.05 to $4.15. The guidance assumptions included same-center NOI growth of 4.5% to 5%, which is very significant given that 2015 is a tough comparison year at [indiscernible] coming in at 6.5%. The acquisition and guidance includes a $330 million of our share of Country Club Plaza, which has been previously announced. It also reflects roughly $1 billion of dispositions, which relates to the joint venture interests that we closed in January with Heitmann and GIC. 
The other assumptions are included in the 8-K supplement filed last night. Our NOI guidance for 2016 is consistent with the guidance we gave in early 2015 after adjusting for the impact of the joint ventures. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."

The leasing activity in the fourth quarter remained, strong reflecting the high-quality nature of the company shopping centers. Occupancy increased to 96.1%, which represented a 30 basis point year-over-year increase. Permanent occupancy ended the year at 90.5%. Temporary Occupancy increased to 5.6%, which reflects the bankruptcies incurred at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. During 2015, a total of 250,000 square feet was converted from temporary to permanent occupancy. 
Leasing spreads were 14.2%, again indicating strong demand for space in the portfolio. Leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed in 2015 was $57.41 per square foot. This represented a 5.4% increase over the prior year. 
During the year, we signed leases for approximately 4 million square feet, which was a 2.4% increase over 2014. The average lease term for leases signed in 2015 was 6.2 years. 
Portfolio of sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year to $635 per square foot. Comparable-center sales increased by 7.6% year-over-year. Sales increases were highest in the West Coast and Arizona centers. And during 2015, sales were positively impacted by: one, high-volume tenants; two, strong categories such as home furnishing, jewelry, cosmetics and athletic footwear; three, organic growth from merchants with strong brands; and four, store closures of underproductive tenants. 
Tourism. While our portfolio only has moderate exposure to international tourists and luxury business, we have seen certain centers impacted by tourism and the stronger U.S. dollar. Most notable in our portfolio is Fashion Outlets in Niagara Falls, whose sales have been impacted by the steep decline in the Canadian dollar. 
Holiday sales. Most retailers are indicating holiday sales were in line with our expectations. Black Friday sales have been distributed over most of the week, starting with pre-Thanksgiving sales. Retailers are also reporting the last few days before Christmas as well as the post-Christmas activity was stronger than expected. Many retailers were promotional throughout the entire season. We believe this is likely to increase the strain on those stores under financial pressure. In general, it appears that specialty stores fared better than department stores during the holiday season. 
2014 and 2015 bankruptcies. As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expect bankruptcies and rent relief requests in 2016 to be at similar or higher levels than in 2015. This is reflected in our 2016 forecast. We believe many of these retailers are likely to restructure and reduce the number of locations within their plate as opposed to liquidate the entire chain. This is likely to impact lower-productivity centers to a greater degree. 
During 2014 and 2015, there were 11 major store closings or bankruptcies that impacted 134 stores or 413,000 square feet within our portfolio. The average rent for these stores was $54 per square foot. They generated sales of $241 per square foot and had an occupancy cost of 22.6%. As of 12/31/15, 66% of the space has been re-leased, resulting in a significant upgrade to the merchandise mix, improved sales productivity and a rent spread in the high single digits. 
E-commerce. We are continuing to learn how retailers use their brick-and-mortar stores as a key component to support growth in their e-commerce sales. A number of important trends are emerging. One, the brick-and-mortar stores are integral to the e-commerce efforts. Two, focus, bought online, pick up in stores is becoming increasingly important to retailers; three, online sales have a high percentage of returns, especially on apparel; four, physical store sales are reduced by online returns, which reduces reported sales for brick-and-mortar locations; five, the customers enter the mall equipped with more information from the web than ever before; six, pure e-tailers are migrating to brick-and-mortar stores, generating new leasing opportunities; and seven, physical store presence improves online sales. These trends are supported by recent customer research conducted at a cross-section of Macerich centers. The research indicated that lower average expenditures and shorter-term durations were more than offset by increased frequency of visits and higher conversion rates. We firmly believe that stores located in densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance to the retailer. 
Big boxes. Throughout the portfolio, there is strong demand for big box users larger than 10,000 square feet. We've increased our exposure with retailers such as TJ Maxx, Home Goods, [indiscernible] Nordstrom Rack. These retailers have opened stores across the portfolio, including closed centers, open-air centers as well as lower-productivity centers. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we signed a lease with JCPenney at inland center to open in the former [indiscernible] building. JCPenney is on track for an opening in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We continue to devote additional resources to activate the common areas of our centers. Efforts are orientated towards permanent kiosks and business development opportunities as well as incubation of online retailers into physical stores. Multiple goals for the common area include revenue enhancement, improved presentation and an elevated customer experience. 
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track. At Broadway Plaza, we have 87% of expansion space under executed leases. We are very pleased with the merchandise mix and eager for the majority of expansion to open during the second quarter of 2016. This will add to our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. 
At Green Acres, anchored by Dick's -- at Green Acres Commons, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, we have 85% of the space under executed leases and are anticipating third quarter opening in 2016. 
Finally, we've completed the public financing agreements and are moving forward with the development of Fashion Outlets at Philadelphia, in partnership with [indiscernible] This project is anticipated to be completed in late 2018 or early 2019 and will incorporate approximately 775,000 square feet of retail area. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

So I'm going to cover just a few other items, and then we'll open it up to Q&A. 
As you can see, our operating results were terrific on every level, whether it be margin improvement, occupancy levels, rents that we have in place in the portfolio, re-leasing spreads. All of these are factors that contributed to a very significant same-center NOI growth rate in 2015 and gives us optimism into the future as to our growth patterns over the next couple of years. It's hard to predict what's going to happen, obviously, in the retail broader environment. And there are many factors that can influence that up or down. But we recognize that if you think about all of the different levers that we can pull, that can create shareholder value, that there probably is no lever more important than having the maximum possible same-center NOI growth pattern. Developments, redevelopments, these are also extremely value creation, but they obviously have capital that gets deployed as part of that process. It is a permanent lever that we will be pulling in the redevelopment arena or the new development arena. And we've got a very strong track record of positive results from those activities, and we anticipate that the projects that are underway right now will continue to drive value for us going forward. 
Another lever that we didn't anticipate that we were going to be able to pull, that would -- that gave us the opportunity, we feel, to create value here was the selected disposition of a noncore asset, a mall in November this past year. And the agreement with Macerich and Taubman to purchase Country Club Plaza in Kansas City from Highwood Properties. That closing is anticipated to close March 1. The gross price is $660 million with a 50% anticipated loan to value that we would anticipate will be put on the property. Most all of our equity will be funded through the -- disposition proceeds that we generated from Panorama. Country Club Plaza is an iconic, 15-block, 1.3-million square-foot mixed-use retail and office property located in the heart of Kansas City. It is well known throughout the industry, and we believe that jointly, with Taubman, we will be successful in taking that property up to an even higher level of performance than where it is right now. We are very pleased to have completed the joint ventures that we did. That was a very significant and large capital decision or capital recycling decision and to effectively have raised new capital in the private markets through joint ventures, that was used to fund either -- both the special dividend that we paid out as well as to fund the stock buyback program that we've announced. And we're pleased that just a couple of months after announcing the $1.2 billion authorization that we've got over 1/3 -- we got about 1/3 of that has been accomplished and delivered to date. So we're very happy about that. 
The status and the new developments. I think we're in very good shape there. If you take a look at Philadelphia, the redevelopment of Broadway Plaza, the addition of the theater to Santa Monica Place, the expansion of Green Acres and the recycling of the Sears Building ultimately at Kings Plaza and Fashion Outlets of San Francisco, we think we're in a very good position through those projects to deliver good shareholder value into the future. But again, I would reiterate that, obviously, in a risk-adjusted basis, we see the opportunity to generate strong same-center NOI growth as being one of the most attractive levers that we can pull in creating shareholder value. 
So with that, operator, I'd like to open it up for Q&A."

So there is no specific number, but we clearly do intend to periodically continue to prune the portfolio and to recycle the capital, funding the purchase of a great center like Country Club Plaza, with the disposition of a very mature, kind of enclosed community center equity source of capital is really, from my viewpoint, a great trade for the company. And likewise, funding development and redevelopment capital going forward through selling off noncore assets is also, to me, a very sensible thing to do."

And you very well -- when you combine '15 and '16, it could average to close to 6%. And I will say that, subsequent to July, leasing environment has been viewed more cautiously as before. In fact, looking at some comments made by my colleague to my right here, Bob Perlmutter, [indiscernible] was looking toward end of the year, we're anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years. And he went on in some length. And in fact, to the extent that internally he earned himself, as a result of that call, the nickname of ""dark cloud"". So I would say that in the second half of the year, we became more cautious as it related in leasing environment, and it certainly affected the 6% growth rate that had been discussed earlier in the year. In terms of the FFO number, a lot of components in there, Alex. Obviously, the joint ventures, which happened late in the year, all financing activity which came in at extremely attractive rates.

And in that context, we see our duty and our opportunity to our retailers to be not only to provide them with the physical space in the mall, but to also support other activities that they have, like buy online deliver from store. Things of that nature. So it's an evolving business, but the one thing that is clear to us, and this kind of goes back as a follow-on to some of the same-center conversations, I'd say that the most important factor that drives your same-center NOI growth is the leasing demand and the rents that you can achieve. Our team is -- and we're not unusual, but our team is extremely well aware of what these locations are worth to retailers, and there's no science that ""They should pay x percent of sales, per se."" We just factor everything in, and the mark-to-market that we've been able to put up over the past many years has been with double-digit leasing spreads, and we see the opportunity to continue those kind of spreads as being very clearly in front of us. And the evolution of brick-and-mortar retailers into more omni-channel retailers makes physical stores more valuable to them. They're valuable not only from the viewpoint of what they sell from the store, but they're also valuable as a service to people -- to their customers, for customers to buy online and then bring it back to the store and exchange it for something else. So they think of all of their activities, and as Bobby was saying, it's really -- it's not so important the exact sales number. It's really more having a knowledge of what's important to that particular retailer, and then that helps you to drive the rents. And if you have must have real estate, which is our goal here, then you're able to put up very good numbers."

We did have to decide who is going to be the manager, and Taubman wanted to do the day-to-day management, and we were fine with that. Our focus with them is going to be more thinking about the marketing, merchandising and potential expansion opportunities that are available at the property. So why we do it together? We just both thought that it was a great opportunity, and we knew it was going to be a competitive situation in terms of bidding, and there were many bidders. We felt that the opportunity to be successful in buying it would be maximized if we join together to buy it. And so far, I think that we both feel very good about this investment opportunity.

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean. 
The fourth quarter reflected continued operational excellence, as evidenced by the strength of our key operating metrics. We saw the successful completions of our joint venture strategy, the completion of a number of highly attractive financings, the reinvestment of capital into our best assets through redevelopment and share buybacks. We'll talk about these in greater detail later in the call. 
We continue to see very significant benefit from our efforts in 2012 through 2015 to sell noncore, slower-growing assets and redeploying that capital into higher-quality, more productive assets. 
Looking at the leasing activity. We had good volume in the fourth quarter. We signed leases under 10,000 square feet. We had 313,000 square feet signed. Positive re-leasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of 14.2%. 
Looking at mall occupancy. It came in at 96.1%, up 30 basis points from 12/31 of '14, to about 70 basis points from our occupancy level at the end of the third quarter. Average mall store base rents also increased to $54.32, up from $51.15 a year ago. 
FFO for the quarter came in at $1.12. That compared to $0.99 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. Same-center NOI increased by 6.4% in the quarter. And year-to-date NOI -- same-center NOI growth was a sector-leading 6.5%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
Looking at the gross margin at the centers. It improved to 71% for the quarter, up from 68.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the year-to-date, margin had improved by 250 basis points to 69.3% compared to 66.8% for the full year 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was up slightly at $1 million, comparing to $800,000 in the fourth quarter last year. The average interest rate at 3.6% was slightly higher than the 3.48% average rate at the end of 2014. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, looking at the key balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap was 34%. Interest coverage ratio was a very strong 4.0x. Debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x. The average debt maturity, and this is after the Arrowhead financing and the closing of the joint venture, is at 6 years, up significantly from a few years ago. We did a total of about $3 billion in financing in 2015. And within the past quarter, we did $1.8 billion. It included Arrowhead, 12-year loan, $400 million at 4.05%; Los Cerritos, another 12-year loan at 4%; Washington Square, $550 million loan, 3.65%, 7 years; South Plains, Twenty Ninth Street, also refinanced. So that was $1.825 billion in financings, average tenure of 10.1 years and average interest rate of 3.94%. 
In mid-November, we set about to execute on our $1.2 billion of approved share buyback. We engaged an investment bank to do a $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program. At the beginning of that program, we received and retired 4.1 million shares, when the plan started, which was November 13, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered based on the average daily volume adjusted price of MAC during the buying period, less the negotiated discount. 
On January 20, 2016, the ASR program was completed. Effectively, MAC bought back $400 million worth of shares at $78.26. We received another 971,000 shares at that time. So this program, the first ASR under the $1.2 billion program, retired, in total, 5.1 million shares. 
Also, since the last call, we had 2 special dividends that resulted from the joint venture transactions. They were each -- of $2. One was paid in December and one in January. 
In our press release this morning, we provide 2016 FFO per share guidance. The range was $4.05 to $4.15. The guidance assumptions included same-center NOI growth of 4.5% to 5%, which is very significant given that 2015 is a tough comparison year, having come in at 6.5%. The acquisition and guidance includes a $330 million of our share of Country Club Plaza, which has been previously announced. It also reflects roughly $1 billion of dispositions, which relates to the joint venture interests that we closed in January with Heitman and GIC. 
The other assumptions are included in the 8-K supplement filed last night. Our NOI guidance for 2016 is consistent with the guidance we gave in early 2015 after adjusting for the impact of the joint ventures. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."

The leasing activity during the fourth quarter remained strong, reflecting the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers. Occupancy increased to 96.1%, which represented a 30 basis point year-over-year increase. Permanent occupancy ended the year at 90.5%. Temporary occupancy increased to 5.6%, which reflects the bankruptcies incurred at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. During 2015, a total of 250,000 square feet was converted from temporary to permanent occupancy. 
Leasing spreads were 14.2%, again indicating strong demand for space in the portfolio. Leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed in 2015 was $57.41 per square foot. This represented a 5.4% increase over the prior year. 
During the year, we signed leases for approximately 4 million square feet, which was a 2.4% increase over 2014. The average lease term for leases signed in 2015 was 6.2 years. 
Portfolio sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year to $635 per square foot. Comparable center sales increased by 7.6% year-over-year. Sales increases were highest in the West Coast and Arizona centers. And during 2015, sales were positively impacted by: one, high-volume tenants; two, strong categories such as home furnishing, jewelry, cosmetics and athletic footwear; three, organic growth from merchants with strong brands; and four, store closures of underproductive tenants. 
Tourism. While our portfolio only has moderate exposure to international tourists and luxury business, we have seen certain centers impacted by tourism and the stronger U.S. dollar. Most notable in our portfolio is Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls, whose sales have been impacted by the steep decline in the Canadian dollar. 
Holiday sales. Most retailers are indicating holiday sales were in line with expectations. Black Friday sales have been distributed over most of the week, starting with pre-Thanksgiving sales. Retailers are also reporting the last few days before Christmas as well as the post-Christmas activity were stronger than expected. Many retailers were promotional throughout the entire season. We believe this is likely to increase the strain on those stores under financial pressure. In general, it appears that specialty stores fared better than department stores during the holiday season. 
2014 and 2015 bankruptcies. As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expect bankruptcies and rent relief requests in 2016 to be at similar or higher levels than in 2015. This is reflected in our 2016 forecast. We believe many of these retailers are likely to restructure and reduce the number of locations within their fleet as opposed to liquidate the entire chain. This is likely to impact lower-productivity centers to a greater degree. 
During 2014 and 2015, there were 11 major store closings or bankruptcies that impacted 134 stores or 413,000 square feet within our portfolio. The average rent for these stores was $54 per square foot. They generated sales of $241 per square foot and had an occupancy cost of 22.6%. As of 12/31/15, 66% of the space has been re-leased, resulting in a significant upgrade to the merchandise mix, improved sales productivity and a rent spread in the high single digits. 
E-commerce. We are continuing to learn how retailers use their brick-and-mortar stores as a key component to support growth in their e-commerce sales. A number of important trends are emerging. One, the brick-and-mortar stores are integral to the e-commerce efforts. Two, BOPUS, bought online, pick up in stores, is becoming increasingly important to retailers. Three, online sales have a high percentage of returns, especially on apparel. Four, physical store sales are reduced by online returns, which reduces reported sales for brick-and-mortar locations. Five, the customers enter the mall equipped with more information from the web than ever before. Six, pure e-tailers are migrating into brick-and-mortar stores, generating new leasing opportunities. And seven, physical store presence improves online sales. 
These trends are supported by recent customer research conducted at a cross-section of Macerich centers. The research indicated that lower average expenditures and shorter-trip durations were more than offset by increased frequency of visits and higher conversion rates. We firmly believe that stores located in densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance to the retailer. 
Big boxes. Throughout the portfolio, there is strong demand for big box users larger than 10,000 square feet. We've increased our exposure with retailers such as T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, ULTA and Nordstrom Rack. These retailers have opened stores across the portfolio, including enclosed centers, open-air centers as well as lower-productivity centers. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we signed a lease with JCPenney at Inland Center to open in the former [indiscernible] building. JCPenney is on track for an opening in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We continue to devote additional resources to activate the common areas of our centers. Efforts are orientated towards permanent kiosks and business development opportunities as well as incubation of online retailers into physical stores. Multiple goals for the common area include revenue enhancement, improved presentation and an elevated customer experience. 
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track. At Broadway Plaza, we have 87% of the expansion space under executed leases. We are very pleased with the merchandise mix and eager for the majority of the expansion to open during the second quarter of 2016. This will add to our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. 
At Green Acres, anchored by Dick's -- at Green Acres Commons, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, we have 85% of the space under executed leases and are anticipating a third quarter opening in 2016. 
Finally, we have completed the public financing agreements and are moving forward with the development of Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, in partnership with PREIT. This project is anticipated to be completed in late 2018 or early 2019, and will incorporate approximately 775,000 square feet of retail area. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

So I'm going to cover just a few other items, and then we'll open it up to Q&A. 
As you can see, our operating results were terrific on every level, whether it be margin improvement, occupancy levels, rents that we have in place in the portfolio, re-leasing spreads. All of these are factors that contributed to a very significant same-center NOI growth rate in 2015 and gives us optimism into the future as to our growth patterns over the next couple of years. It's hard to predict what's going to happen, obviously, in the retail broader environment. And there are many factors that could influence that up or down. But we recognize that if you think about all of the different levers that we can pull that can create shareholder value, that there probably is no lever more important than having the maximum possible same-center NOI growth pattern. Developments, redevelopments, these are also extremely value creation, but they obviously have capital that gets deployed as part of that process. It is a permanent lever that we will be pulling in the redevelopment arena or the new development arena. And we've got a very strong track record of positive results from those activities. And we anticipate that the projects that are under way right now will continue to drive value for us going forward. 
Another lever that we didn't anticipate that we were going to be able to pull, that would -- that gave us the opportunity, we feel, to create value here, was the selective disposition of a noncore asset, Panorama Mall in November of this past year. And the agreement with Macerich and Taubman to purchase Country Club Plaza in Kansas City from Highwoods Properties. That closing is anticipated to close March 1. The gross price is $660 million with a 50% anticipated loan to value that we would anticipate will be put on the property. Most all of our equity will be funded through the disposition proceeds that we generated from Panorama. Country Club Plaza is an iconic 15-block, 1.3-million square-foot mixed-use retail and office property located in the heart of Kansas City. It is well known throughout the industry. And we believe that jointly with Taubman, we will be successful in taking that property up to an even higher level of performance than where it is right now. We're very pleased to have completed the joint ventures that we did. That was a very significant and large capital decision or capital recycling decision and to effectively have raised new capital in the private markets through joint ventures, that was used to fund either -- both the special dividend that we paid out as well as to fund the stock buyback program that we've announced. And we're pleased that just a couple of months after announcing the $1.2 billion authorization, that we've got over 1/3 -- we got about 1/3 of that has been accomplished and delivered to date. So we're very happy about that. 
The status on the new developments. I think we're in very good shape there. If you take a look at Philadelphia, the redevelopment of Broadway Plaza, the addition of the theater to Santa Monica Place, the expansion of Green Acres and the recycling of the Sears building ultimately at Kings Plaza and Fashion Outlets of San Francisco, we think we're in a very good position for those projects to deliver good shareholder value into the future. But again, I would reiterate that, obviously, on a risk-adjusted basis, we see the opportunity to generate strong same-center NOI growth as being one of the most attractive levers that we can pull in creating shareholder value. 
So with that, operator, I'd like to open it up for Q&A."

So there is no specific number, but we clearly do intend to periodically continue to prune the portfolio and to recycle the capital. Funding the purchase of a great center like Country Club Plaza with the disposition of a very mature kind of enclosed community center equity source of capital is really, from my viewpoint, a great trade for the company.

There was a comment made in July of '15 that was a caveat, that it wasn't guidance, but that internally we were hoping to see same-center NOI growth of 6% over the next couple of years. And you very well -- when you combine '15 and '16, it could average to close to 6%. And I will say that subsequent to July, the leasing environment has been viewed more cautiously as before. In fact, looking at some comments made by my colleague to my right here, Bob Perlmutter, one of his quotes was, ""Looking towards the end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years."" And he went on at some length, in fact, to the extent that internally, he earned himself, as a result of that call, the nickname of ""Dark Cloud"". So I would say that through the second half of the year, we became more cautious as it related to the leasing environment. And that certainly affected the 6% growth rate that had been discussed earlier in the year. In terms of the FFO number, a lot of components in there, Alex. Obviously, the joint ventures, which happened late in the year, all financing activity which came in at extremely attractive rates, all those things affected the FFO number as well as the buybacks and the accretion from those. We did have a lot of cash on the balance sheet, which is dilutive. So there are many factors that went into the ultimate FFO number."

And in that context, we see our duty and our opportunity to our retailers to be not only to provide them with the physical space in the mall, but to also support other activities that they have, like buy online, deliver from store, things of that nature. So it's an evolving business, but the one thing that is clear to us -- and this kind of goes back as a follow-on to some of the same-center conversations -- I'd say that the most important factor that drives your same-center NOI growth is the leasing demand and the rents that you can achieve. And our team is -- and we're not unusual, but our team is extremely well aware of what these locations are worth to retailers, and there's no science that they should pay X percent of sales, per se. We just factor everything in, and the mark-to-market that we've been able to put up over the past many years has been with double-digit leasing spreads. And we see the opportunity to continue those kind of spreads as being very clearly in front of us. And the evolution of brick-and-mortar retailers into more omnichannel retailers makes physical stores more valuable to them. They're valuable not only from the viewpoint of what they sell from the store, but they're also valuable as a service to people -- to their customers, for customers to buy online and then bring it back to the store and exchange it for something else. So they think of all of their activities. And as Bobby was saying, it's really -- it's not so important, the exact sales number. It's really more having a knowledge of what's important to that particular retailer, and then that helps you to drive the rents. And if you have must-have real estate, which is our goal here, then you're able to put up very good numbers."

That happens more in the existing portfolio than in terms of new developments, which we obviously target the strongest retailers in the market for. In terms of where it impacts us, our position on many of the bankruptcies has been that, as part of a restructuring, you're investing in the retailers' business, and we only want to invest in the retailers that we think have good long-term viability. And because of that, we have probably taken a little bit more stringent stance on not restructuring with certain retailers who have gone through bankruptcy. The net impact for us is a short-term negative in terms of potential loss of occupancy, but we think a long-term positive in terms of being able to replace the stores with stronger retailers at higher rents."

So from a merchandising viewpoint, Bobby and a couple of his key lieutenants and the person that runs leasing at Taubman, they've been collaborating and putting together a merchandising plan.

But as we sit down and identify which tenants we think that we want to either move out or to move in, whichever team has the better relationship with that tenant will take the lead. But you should think of it as joint, right, on all major decisions and a whole bunch of operating decisions. We did have to decide who was going to be the manager, and Taubman wanted to do the day-to-day management, and we were fine with that. Our focus with them is going to be more thinking about the marketing, merchandising and potential expansion opportunities that are available at the property. So why did we do it together? We just both thought that it was a great opportunity, and we knew it was going to be a competitive situation in terms of bidding. And there were many bidders. We felt that the opportunity to be successful in buying it would be maximized if we joined together to buy it. And so far, I think that we both feel very good about this investment opportunity. And it may have been that doing it together is what resulted in the best thinking in terms of coming up with the confidence to pay the price that was required here. So we feel very good about the thesis, and it's playing out, I believe, well. And we think that the Plaza has terrific upside. And I think, time will tell, but I think you're going to see some very significant opportunities for us to generate value there."

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean. 
The fourth quarter reflected continued operational excellence, as evidenced by the strength of our key operating metrics. We saw the successful completions of our joint venture strategy, the completion of a number of highly attractive financings, the reinvestment of capital into our best assets through redevelopment and share buybacks. We'll talk about these in greater detail later in the call. 
We continue to see very significant benefit from our efforts in 2012 through 2015 to sell noncore, slower-growing assets and redeploying that capital into higher-quality, more productive assets. 
Looking at the leasing activity. We had good volume in the fourth quarter. We signed leases under 10,000 square feet. We had 313,000 square feet signed. Positive re-leasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of 14.2%. 
Looking at mall occupancy. It came in at 96.1%, up 30 basis points from 12/31 of '14, to about 70 basis points from our occupancy level at the end of the third quarter. Average mall store base rents also increased to $54.32, up from $51.15 a year ago. 
FFO for the quarter came in at $1.12. That compared to $0.99 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. Same-center NOI increased by 6.4% in the quarter. And year-to-date NOI -- same-center NOI growth was a sector-leading 6.5%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
Looking at the gross margin at the centers. It improved to 71% for the quarter, up from 68.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the year-to-date, margin had improved by 250 basis points to 69.3% compared to 66.8% for the full year 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was up slightly at $1 million, comparing to $800,000 in the fourth quarter last year. The average interest rate at 3.6% was slightly higher than the 3.48% average rate at the end of 2014. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, looking at the key balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap was 34%. Interest coverage ratio was a very strong 4.0x. Debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x. The average debt maturity, and this is after the Arrowhead financing and the closing of the joint venture, is at 6 years, up significantly from a few years ago. We did a total of about $3 billion in financing in 2015. And within the past quarter, we did $1.8 billion. It included Arrowhead, 12-year loan, $400 million at 4.05%; Los Cerritos, another 12-year loan at 4%; Washington Square, $550 million loan, 3.65%, 7 years; South Plains, Twenty Ninth Street, also refinanced. So that was $1.825 billion in financings, average tenure of 10.1 years and average interest rate of 3.94%. 
In mid-November, we set about to execute on our $1.2 billion of approved share buyback. We engaged an investment bank to do a $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program. At the beginning of that program, we received and retired 4.1 million shares, when the plan started, which was November 13, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered based on the average daily volume adjusted price of MAC during the buying period, less the negotiated discount. 
On January 20, 2016, the ASR program was completed. Effectively, MAC bought back $400 million worth of shares at $78.26. We received another 971,000 shares at that time. So this program, the first ASR under the $1.2 billion program, retired, in total, 5.1 million shares. 
Also, since the last call, we had 2 special dividends that resulted from the joint venture transactions. They were each -- of $2. One was paid in December and one in January. 
In our press release this morning, we provide 2016 FFO per share guidance. The range was $4.05 to $4.15. The guidance assumptions included same-center NOI growth of 4.5% to 5%, which is very significant given that 2015 is a tough comparison year, having come in at 6.5%. The acquisition and guidance includes a $330 million of our share of Country Club Plaza, which has been previously announced. It also reflects roughly $1 billion of dispositions, which relates to the joint venture interests that we closed in January with Heitman and GIC. 
The other assumptions are included in the 8-K supplement filed last night. Our NOI guidance for 2016 is consistent with the guidance we gave in early 2015 after adjusting for the impact of the joint ventures. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."

The leasing activity during the fourth quarter remained strong, reflecting the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers.

The leasing activity during the fourth quarter remained strong, reflecting the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers. Occupancy increased to 96.1%, which represented a 30 basis point year-over-year increase. Permanent occupancy ended the year at 90.5%. Temporary occupancy increased to 5.6%, which reflects the bankruptcies incurred at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. During 2015, a total of 250,000 square feet was converted from temporary to permanent occupancy. 
Leasing spreads were 14.2%, again indicating strong demand for space in the portfolio. Leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed in 2015 was $57.41 per square foot. This represented a 5.4% increase over the prior year. 
During the year, we signed leases for approximately 4 million square feet, which was a 2.4% increase over 2014. The average lease term for leases signed in 2015 was 6.2 years. 
Portfolio sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year to $635 per square foot. Comparable center sales increased by 7.6% year-over-year. Sales increases were highest in the West Coast and Arizona centers. And during 2015, sales were positively impacted by: one, high-volume tenants; two, strong categories such as home furnishing, jewelry, cosmetics and athletic footwear; three, organic growth from merchants with strong brands; and four, store closures of underproductive tenants. 
Tourism. While our portfolio only has moderate exposure to international tourists and luxury business, we have seen certain centers impacted by tourism and the stronger U.S. dollar. Most notable in our portfolio is Fashion Outlets in Niagara Falls, whose sales have been impacted by the steep decline in the Canadian dollar. 
Holiday sales. Most retailers are indicating holiday sales were in line with expectations. Black Friday sales have been distributed over most of the week, starting with pre-Thanksgiving sales. Retailers are also reporting the last few days before Christmas as well as the post-Christmas activity were stronger than expected. Many retailers were promotional throughout the entire season. We believe this is likely to increase the strain on those stores under financial pressure. In general, it appears that specialty stores fared better than department stores during the holiday season. 
2014 and 2015 bankruptcies. As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expect bankruptcies and rent relief requests in 2016 to be at similar or higher levels than in 2015. This is reflected in our 2016 forecast. We believe many of these retailers are likely to restructure and reduce the number of locations within their fleet as opposed to liquidate the entire chain. This is likely to impact lower-productivity centers to a greater degree. 
During 2014 and 2015, there were 11 major store closings or bankruptcies that impacted 134 stores or 413,000 square feet within our portfolio. The average rent for these stores was $54 per square foot. They generated sales of $241 per square foot and had an occupancy cost of 22.6%. As of 12/31/15, 66% of the space has been re-leased, resulting in a significant upgrade to the merchandise mix, improved sales productivity and a rent spread in the high single digits. 
E-commerce. We are continuing to learn how retailers use their brick-and-mortar stores as a key component to support growth in their e-commerce sales. A number of important trends are emerging. One, the brick-and-mortar stores are integral to the e-commerce efforts. Two, BOPUS, bought online, pick up in stores, is becoming increasingly important to retailers. Three, online sales have a high percentage of returns, especially on apparel. Four, physical store sales are reduced by online returns, which reduces reported sales for brick-and-mortar locations. Five, the customers enter the mall equipped with more information from the web than ever before. Six, pure e-tailers are migrating into brick-and-mortar stores, generating new leasing opportunities. And seven, physical store presence improves online sales. 
These trends are supported by recent customer research conducted at a cross-section of Macerich centers. The research indicated that lower average expenditures and shorter-trip durations were more than offset by increased frequency of visits and higher conversion rates. We firmly believe that stores located in densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance to the retailer. 
Big boxes. Throughout the portfolio, there is strong demand for big box users larger than 10,000 square feet. We've increased our exposure with retailers such as T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, ULTA and Nordstrom Rack. These retailers have opened stores across the portfolio, including enclosed centers, open-air centers as well as lower-productivity centers. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we signed a lease with JCPenney at Inland Center to open in the former Gottschalks building. JCPenney is on track for an opening in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We continue to devote additional resources to activate the common areas of our centers. Efforts are orientated towards permanent kiosks and business development opportunities as well as incubation of online retailers into physical stores. Multiple goals for the common area include revenue enhancement, improved presentation and an elevated customer experience. 
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track. At Broadway Plaza, we have 87% of the expansion space under executed leases. We are very pleased with the merchandise mix and eager for the majority of the expansion to open during the second quarter of 2016. This will add to our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. 
At Green Acres, anchored by Dick's -- at Green Acres Commons, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, we have 85% of the space under executed leases and are anticipating a third quarter opening in 2016. 
Finally, we have completed the public financing agreements and are moving forward with the development of Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, in partnership with PREIT. This project is anticipated to be completed in late 2018 or early 2019, and will incorporate approximately 775,000 square feet of retail area. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

So I'm going to cover just a few other items, and then we'll open it up to Q&A. 
As you can see, our operating results were terrific on every level, whether it be margin improvement, occupancy levels, rents that we have in place in the portfolio, re-leasing spreads. All of these are factors that contributed to a very significant same-center NOI growth rate in 2015 and gives us optimism into the future as to our growth patterns over the next couple of years. It's hard to predict what's going to happen, obviously, in the retail broader environment. And there are many factors that could influence that up or down. But we recognize that if you think about all of the different levers that we can pull that can create shareholder value, that there probably is no lever more important than having the maximum possible same-center NOI growth pattern. Developments, redevelopments, these are also extremely value creation, but they obviously have capital that gets deployed as part of that process. It is a permanent lever that we will be pulling in the redevelopment arena or the new development arena. And we've got a very strong track record of positive results from those activities. And we anticipate that the projects that are under way right now will continue to drive value for us going forward. 
Another lever that we didn't anticipate that we were going to be able to pull, that would -- that gave us the opportunity, we feel, to create value here, was the selective disposition of a noncore asset, Panorama Mall in November of this past year. And the agreement with Macerich and Taubman to purchase Country Club Plaza in Kansas City from Highwoods Properties. That closing is anticipated to close March 1. The gross price is $660 million with a 50% anticipated loan to value that we would anticipate will be put on the property. Most all of our equity will be funded through the disposition proceeds that we generated from Panorama. Country Club Plaza is an iconic 15-block, 1.3-million square-foot mixed-use retail and office property located in the heart of Kansas City. It is well known throughout the industry. And we believe that jointly with Taubman, we will be successful in taking that property up to an even higher level of performance than where it is right now. We're very pleased to have completed the joint ventures that we did. That was a very significant and large capital decision, a capital recycling decision, and to effectively have raised new capital in the private markets through joint ventures, that was used to fund either -- both the special dividend that we paid out as well as to fund the stock buyback program that we've announced. And we're pleased that just a couple of months after announcing the $1.2 billion authorization, that we've got over 1/3 -- we got about 1/3 of that has been accomplished and delivered to date. So we're very happy about that. 
The status on the new developments. I think we're in very good shape there. If you take a look at Philadelphia, the redevelopment of Broadway Plaza, the addition of the theater to Santa Monica Place, the expansion of Green Acres and the recycling of the Sears building ultimately at Kings Plaza and Fashion Outlets of San Francisco, we think we're in a very good position for those projects to deliver good shareholder value into the future. But again, I would reiterate that, obviously, on a risk-adjusted basis, we see the opportunity to generate strong same-center NOI growth as being one of the most attractive levers that we can pull in creating shareholder value. 
So with that, operator, I'd like to open it up for Q&A."

So there is no specific number, but we clearly do intend to periodically continue to prune the portfolio and to recycle the capital. Funding the purchase of a great center like Country Club Plaza with the disposition of a very mature kind of enclosed community center equity source of capital is really, from my viewpoint, a great trade for the company. And likewise, funding development and redevelopment capital going forward through selling off noncore assets is also, to me, a very sensible thing to do."

There was a comment made in July of '15 that was a caveat, that it wasn't guidance, but that internally we were hoping to see same-center NOI growth of 6% over the next couple of years. And you very well -- when you combine '15 and '16, it could average to close to 6%. And I will say that subsequent to July, the leasing environment has been viewed more cautiously as before. In fact, looking at some comments made by my colleague to my right here, Bob Perlmutter, one of his quotes was, ""Looking towards the end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years."" And he went on at some length, in fact, to the extent that internally, he earned himself, as a result of that call, the nickname of ""Dark Cloud"". So I would say that through the second half of the year, we became more cautious as it related to the leasing environment. And that certainly affected the 6% growth rate that had been discussed earlier in the year. In terms of the FFO number, a lot of components in there, Alex. Obviously, the joint ventures, which happened late in the year, all the financing activity which came in at extremely attractive rates, all those things affected the FFO number as well as the buybacks and the accretion from those. We did have a lot of cash on the balance sheet, which is dilutive. So there are many factors that went into the ultimate FFO number."

And in that context, we see our duty and our opportunity to our retailers to be not only to provide them with the physical space in the mall, but to also support other activities that they have, like buy online, deliver from store, things of that nature. So it's an evolving business, but the one thing that is clear to us -- and this kind of goes back as a follow-on to some of the same-center conversations -- I'd say that the most important factor that drives your same-center NOI growth is the leasing demand and the rents that you can achieve. And our team is -- and we're not unusual, but our team is extremely well aware of what these locations are worth to retailers, and there's no science that they should pay X percent of sales, per se. We just factor everything in, and the mark-to-market that we've been able to put up over the past many years has been with double-digit leasing spreads. And we see the opportunity to continue those kind of spreads as being very clearly in front of us. And the evolution of brick-and-mortar retailers into more omnichannel retailers makes physical stores more valuable to them. They're valuable not only from the viewpoint of what they sell from the store, but they're also valuable as a service to people -- to their customers, for customers to buy online and then bring it back to the store and exchange it for something else. So they think of all of their activities. And as Bobby was saying, it's really -- it's not so important, the exact sales number. It's really more having a knowledge of what's important to that particular retailer, and then that helps you to drive the rents. And if you have must-have real estate, which is our goal here, then you're able to put up very good numbers."

We did have to decide who was going to be the manager, and Taubman wanted to do the day-to-day management, and we were fine with that. Our focus with them is going to be more thinking about the marketing, merchandising and potential expansion opportunities that are available at the property. So why did we do it together? We just both thought that it was a great opportunity, and we knew it was going to be a competitive situation in terms of bidding. And there were many bidders. We felt that the opportunity to be successful in buying it would be maximized if we joined together to buy it. And so far, I think that we both feel very good about this investment opportunity. And it may have been that doing it together is what resulted in the best thinking in terms of coming up with the confidence to pay the price that was required here.

And as we've talked a lot about in the past, we find that the dominant assets in the densely populated trade areas, where the retailers have limited options, always drive the highest rents."

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to call me or John Perry or Jean. 
The fourth quarter reflected continued operational excellence, as evidenced by the strength of our key operating metrics. We saw the successful completions of our joint venture strategy, the completion of a number of highly attractive financings, the reinvestment of capital into our best assets through redevelopment and share buybacks. We'll talk about these in greater detail later in the call. 
We continue to see very significant benefit from our efforts in 2012 through 2015 to sell noncore, slower-growing assets and redeploying that capital into higher-quality, more productive assets. 
Looking at the leasing activity. We had good volume in the fourth quarter. We signed leases under 10,000 square feet. We had 313,000 square feet signed. Positive re-leasing spread on a trailing 12-month basis of 14.2%. 
Looking at mall occupancy. It came in at 96.1%, up 30 basis points from 12/31 of '14, to about 70 basis points from our occupancy level at the end of the third quarter. Average mall store base rents also increased to $54.32, up from $51.15 a year ago. 
FFO for the quarter came in at $1.12. That compared to $0.99 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. Same-center NOI increased by 6.4% in the quarter. And year-to-date NOI -- same-center NOI growth was a sector-leading 6.5%. This increase was driven by increased occupancy, double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. 
Looking at the gross margin at the centers. It improved to 71% for the quarter, up from 68.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the year-to-date, margin had improved by 250 basis points to 69.3% compared to 66.8% for the full year 2014. 
Bad debt expense for the quarter was up slightly at $1 million, comparing to $800,000 in the fourth quarter last year. The average interest rate at 3.6% was slightly higher than the 3.48% average rate at the end of 2014. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, looking at the key balance sheet metrics, debt-to-market cap was 34%. Interest coverage ratio was a very strong 4.0x. Debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x. The average debt maturity, and this is after the Arrowhead financing and the closing of the joint venture, is at 6 years, up significantly from a few years ago. We did a total of about $3 billion in financing in 2015. And within the past quarter, we did $1.8 billion. It included Arrowhead, 12-year loan, $400 million at 4.05%; Los Cerritos, another 12-year loan at 4%; Washington Square, $550 million loan, 3.65%, 7 years; South Plains, Twenty Ninth Street, also refinanced. So that was $1.825 billion in financings, average tenure of 10.1 years and average interest rate of 3.94%. 
In mid-November, we set about to execute on our $1.2 billion of approved share buyback. We engaged an investment bank to do a $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program. At the beginning of that program, we received and retired 4.1 million shares, when the plan started, which was November 13, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered based on the average daily volume adjusted price of MAC during the buying period, less the negotiated discount. 
On January 20, 2016, the ASR program was completed. Effectively, MAC bought back $400 million worth of shares at $78.26. We received another 971,000 shares at that time. So this program, the first ASR under the $1.2 billion program, retired, in total, 5.1 million shares. 
Also, since the last call, we had 2 special dividends that resulted from the joint venture transactions. They were each -- of $2. One was paid in December and one in January. 
In our press release this morning, we provide 2016 FFO per share guidance. The range was $4.05 to $4.15. The guidance assumptions included same-center NOI growth of 4.5% to 5%, which is very significant given that 2015 is a tough comparison year, having come in at 6.5%. The acquisition and guidance includes a $330 million of our share of Country Club Plaza, which has been previously announced. It also reflects roughly $1 billion of dispositions, which relates to the joint venture interests that we closed in January with Heitman and GIC. 
The other assumptions are included in the 8-K supplement filed last night. Our NOI guidance for 2016 is consistent with the guidance we gave in early 2015 after adjusting for the impact of the joint ventures. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Bobby to discuss the leasing environment."

The leasing activity during the fourth quarter remained strong, reflecting the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers. Occupancy increased to 96.1%, which represented a 30 basis point year-over-year increase. Permanent occupancy ended the year at 90.5%. Temporary occupancy increased to 5.6%, which reflects the bankruptcies incurred at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015. During 2015, a total of 250,000 square feet was converted from temporary to permanent occupancy. 
Leasing spreads were 14.2%, again indicating strong demand for space in the portfolio. Leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed in 2015 was $57.41 per square foot. This represented a 5.4% increase over the prior year. 
During the year, we signed leases for approximately 4 million square feet, which was a 2.4% increase over 2014. The average lease term for leases signed in 2015 was 6.2 years. 
Portfolio sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year to $635 per square foot. Comparable center sales increased by 7.6% year-over-year. Sales increases were highest in the West Coast and Arizona centers. And during 2015, sales were positively impacted by: one, high-volume tenants; two, strong categories such as home furnishing, jewelry, cosmetics and athletic footwear; three, organic growth from merchants with strong brands; and four, store closures of underproductive tenants. 
Tourism. While our portfolio only has moderate exposure to international tourists and luxury business, we have seen certain centers impacted by tourism and the stronger U.S. dollar. Most notable in our portfolio is Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls, whose sales have been impacted by the steep decline in the Canadian dollar. 
Holiday sales. Most retailers are indicating holiday sales were in line with expectations. Black Friday sales have been distributed over most of the week, starting with pre-Thanksgiving sales. Retailers are also reporting the last few days before Christmas as well as the post-Christmas activity were stronger than expected. Many retailers were promotional throughout the entire season. We believe this is likely to increase the strain on those stores under financial pressure. In general, it appears that specialty stores fared better than department stores during the holiday season. 
2014 and 2015 bankruptcies. As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expect bankruptcies and rent relief requests in 2016 to be at similar or higher levels than in 2015. This is reflected in our 2016 forecast. We believe many of these retailers are likely to restructure and reduce the number of locations within their fleet as opposed to liquidate the entire chain. This is likely to impact lower-productivity centers to a greater degree. 
During 2014 and 2015, there were 11 major store closings or bankruptcies that impacted 134 stores or 413,000 square feet within our portfolio. The average rent for these stores was $54 per square foot. They generated sales of $241 per square foot and had an occupancy cost of 22.6%. As of 12/31/15, 66% of the space has been re-leased, resulting in a significant upgrade to the merchandise mix, improved sales productivity and a rent spread in the high single digits. 
E-commerce. We are continuing to learn how retailers use their brick-and-mortar stores as a key component to support growth in their e-commerce sales. A number of important trends are emerging. One, the brick-and-mortar stores are integral to the e-commerce efforts. Two, BOPUS, bought online, pick up in stores, is becoming increasingly important to retailers. Three, online sales have a high percentage of returns, especially on apparel. Four, physical store sales are reduced by online returns, which reduces reported sales for brick-and-mortar locations. Five, the customers enter the mall equipped with more information from the web than ever before. Six, pure e-tailers are migrating into brick-and-mortar stores, generating new leasing opportunities. And seven, physical store presence improves online sales. 
These trends are supported by recent customer research conducted at a cross-section of Macerich centers. The research indicated that lower average expenditures and shorter-trip durations were more than offset by increased frequency of visits and higher conversion rates. We firmly believe that stores located in densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance to the retailer. 
Big boxes. Throughout the portfolio, there is strong demand for big box users larger than 10,000 square feet. We've increased our exposure with retailers such as T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, ULTA and Nordstrom Rack. These retailers have opened stores across the portfolio, including enclosed centers, open-air centers as well as lower-productivity centers. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we signed a lease with JCPenney at Inland Center to open in the former Gottschalks building. JCPenney is on track for an opening in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We continue to devote additional resources to activate the common areas of our centers. Efforts are orientated towards permanent kiosks and business development opportunities as well as incubation of online retailers into physical stores. Multiple goals for the common area include revenue enhancement, improved presentation and an elevated customer experience. 
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track. At Broadway Plaza, we have 87% of the expansion space under executed leases. We are very pleased with the merchandise mix and eager for the majority of the expansion to open during the second quarter of 2016. This will add to our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. 
At Green Acres, anchored by Dick's -- at Green Acres Commons, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, we have 85% of the space under executed leases and are anticipating a third quarter opening in 2016. 
Finally, we have completed the public financing agreements and are moving forward with the development of Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, in partnership with PREIT. This project is anticipated to be completed in late 2018 or early 2019, and will incorporate approximately 775,000 square feet of retail area. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

So I'm going to cover just a few other items, and then we'll open it up to Q&A. 
As you can see, our operating results were terrific on every level, whether it be margin improvement, occupancy levels, rents that we have in place in the portfolio, re-leasing spreads. All of these are factors that contributed to a very significant same-center NOI growth rate in 2015 and gives us optimism into the future as to our growth patterns over the next couple of years. It's hard to predict what's going to happen, obviously, in the retail broader environment. And there are many factors that could influence that up or down. But we recognize that if you think about all of the different levers that we can pull that can create shareholder value, that there probably is no lever more important than having the maximum possible same-center NOI growth pattern. Developments, redevelopments, these are also extremely value creation, but they obviously have capital that gets deployed as part of that process. It is a permanent lever that we will be pulling in the redevelopment arena or the new development arena. And we've got a very strong track record of positive results from those activities. And we anticipate that the projects that are under way right now will continue to drive value for us going forward. 
Another lever that we didn't anticipate that we were going to be able to pull, that would -- that gave us the opportunity, we feel, to create value here, was the selective disposition of a noncore asset, Panorama Mall in November of this past year. And the agreement with Macerich and Taubman to purchase Country Club Plaza in Kansas City from Highwoods Properties. That closing is anticipated to close March 1. The gross price is $660 million with a 50% anticipated loan to value that we would anticipate will be put on the property. Most all of our equity will be funded through the disposition proceeds that we generated from Panorama. Country Club Plaza is an iconic 15-block, 1.3-million square-foot mixed-use retail and office property located in the heart of Kansas City. It is well known throughout the industry. And we believe that jointly with Taubman, we will be successful in taking that property up to an even higher level of performance than where it is right now. We're very pleased to have completed the joint ventures that we did. That was a very significant and large capital decision, a capital recycling decision, and to effectively have raised new capital in the private markets through joint ventures, that was used to fund either -- both the special dividend that we paid out as well as to fund the stock buyback program that we've announced. And we're pleased that just a couple of months after announcing the $1.2 billion authorization, that we've got over 1/3 -- we got about 1/3 of that has been accomplished and delivered to date. So we're very happy about that. 
The status on the new developments. I think we're in very good shape there. If you take a look at Philadelphia, the redevelopment of Broadway Plaza, the addition of the theater to Santa Monica Place, the expansion of Green Acres and the recycling of the Sears building ultimately at Kings Plaza and Fashion Outlets of San Francisco, we think we're in a very good position for those projects to deliver good shareholder value into the future. But again, I would reiterate that, obviously, on a risk-adjusted basis, we see the opportunity to generate strong same-center NOI growth as being one of the most attractive levers that we can pull in creating shareholder value. 
So with that, operator, I'd like to open it up for Q&A."

So there is no specific number, but we clearly do intend to periodically continue to prune the portfolio and to recycle the capital. Funding the purchase of a great center like Country Club Plaza with the disposition of a very mature kind of enclosed community center equity source of capital is really, from my viewpoint, a great trade for the company. And likewise, funding development and redevelopment capital going forward through selling off noncore assets is also, to me, a very sensible thing to do."

Sort of like what you've delivered in '15 over the next few years. This year, the NOI guidance is below that, but yet the bottom line FFO number exceeds what The Street was expecting. So can you just help us walk through if we should expect same-store NOI to get back to that 6% number or maybe there are some non-same-store items that are really driving the FFO beat relative to consensus?"

There was a comment made in July of '15 that was a caveat, that it wasn't guidance, but that internally we were hoping to see same-center NOI growth of 6% over the next couple of years. And you very well -- when you combine '15 and '16, it could average to close to 6%. And I will say that subsequent to July, the leasing environment has been viewed more cautiously as before. In fact, looking at some comments made by my colleague to my right here, Bob Perlmutter, one of his quotes was, ""Looking towards the end of the year, we are anticipating that bankruptcies are likely to be comparable or higher than in previous years."" And he went on at some length, in fact, to the extent that internally, he earned himself, as a result of that call, the nickname of ""Dark Cloud"". So I would say that through the second half of the year, we became more cautious as it related to the leasing environment. And that certainly affected the 6% growth rate that had been discussed earlier in the year. In terms of the FFO number, a lot of components in there, Alex. Obviously, the joint ventures, which happened late in the year, all the financing activity which came in at extremely attractive rates, all those things affected the FFO number as well as the buybacks and the accretion from those. We did have a lot of cash on the balance sheet, which is dilutive. So there are many factors that went into the ultimate FFO number."

And in that context, we see our duty and our opportunity to our retailers to be not only to provide them with the physical space in the mall, but to also support other activities that they have, like buy online, deliver from store, things of that nature. So it's an evolving business, but the one thing that is clear to us -- and this kind of goes back as a follow-on to some of the same-center conversations -- I'd say that the most important factor that drives your same-center NOI growth is the leasing demand and the rents that you can achieve. And our team is -- and we're not unusual, but our team is extremely well aware of what these locations are worth to retailers, and there's no science that they should pay X percent of sales, per se. We just factor everything in, and the mark-to-market that we've been able to put up over the past many years has been with double-digit leasing spreads. And we see the opportunity to continue those kind of spreads as being very clearly in front of us. And the evolution of brick-and-mortar retailers into more omnichannel retailers makes physical stores more valuable to them. They're valuable not only from the viewpoint of what they sell from the store, but they're also valuable as a service to people -- to their customers, for customers to buy online and then bring it back to the store and exchange it for something else. So they think of all of their activities. And as Bobby was saying, it's really -- it's not so important, the exact sales number. It's really more having a knowledge of what's important to that particular retailer, and then that helps you to drive the rents. And if you have must-have real estate, which is our goal here, then you're able to put up very good numbers."

So from a merchandising viewpoint, Bobby and a couple of his key lieutenants and the person that runs leasing at Taubman, they've been collaborating and putting together a merchandising plan. And it's really going to be, I think, relationship-driven. But as we sit down and identify which tenants we think that we want to either move out or to move in, whichever team has the better relationship with that tenant will take the lead. But you should think of it as joint, right, on all major decisions and a whole bunch of operating decisions. We did have to decide who was going to be the manager, and Taubman wanted to do the day-to-day management, and we were fine with that. Our focus with them is going to be more thinking about the marketing, merchandising and potential expansion opportunities that are available at the property. So why did we do it together? We just both thought that it was a great opportunity, and we knew it was going to be a competitive situation in terms of bidding. And there were many bidders. We felt that the opportunity to be successful in buying it would be maximized if we joined together to buy it. And so far, I think that we both feel very good about this investment opportunity. And it may have been that doing it together is what resulted in the best thinking in terms of coming up with the confidence to pay the price that was required here. So we feel very good about the thesis, and it's playing out, I believe, well. And we think that the Plaza has terrific upside. And I think, time will tell, but I think you're going to see some very significant opportunities for us to generate value there."

If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call. 
The first quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolios' key operating metrics. We continued to execute on our previously announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also, recently completed the sale of a noncore mall. We'll talk about those in greater detail later on the call. 
For the quarter, FFO was $0.87 compared to $0.79 for the quarter ended March 31 of 2015. Negatively impacting the quarterly FFO results was $3.5 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt on the prepayment of the Arrowhead Town Center loan in January.
Other things impacting in the quarter were same center NOI, which increased by 7.5% compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made significant expense cuts and initiated cost savings programs that started in the second quarter of '15. So about 1/3 of the same center NOI growth this quarter comes from but the impact of those expense cuts compared to the first quarter of last year.
The balance of the growth was driven by double-digit releasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating management. Same center NOI growth for the balance the year will obviously be less than the first quarter as we hit comp quarters that already had the impact of the expense cuts.  Our estimate for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range.
Gross operating margin at the centers for the quarter improved to 68.6% from 66.6% in the first quarter of last year. That debt expense was modest at $1.2 million, down from $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year. As a result of a very attractive financing market, the average interest rate continues to be very low at 3.62%, also up slightly from 3.49% a year ago. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, debt to market cap was 35.8%. The interest coverage ratio was a very healthy 3.5x, debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2X, and the average debt maturity, 6.14 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. In addition to closing the previously announced Arrowhead Town Center loan in January, we have closed or committed on 2 other life company loans and we're in the market with a third. Subsequent our purchase of Country Club Plaza, we put a $320 million loan in place. That's 10 years fixed with an interest rate of 3.85%. We also committed to a $375 million loan at The Shops at Northbridge. That's a 12-year fixed rate loan. The rate is locked after 3.68% and we should have closed that loan in the next few weeks. That refi will pay off the existing loan, which is $189 million with an interest rate of 7.5%. So our effectively doubling the size of the loan and cut the interest rate in half.
We're also currently in the market for financing on and in addition to very attractive life company bids, we're also seeing some very competitive CMBS bids and that's for the first time in the past 6 months or so. And again, these are 8 quality malls. I'm not sure that the CMBS market exists for all property types and qualities but certainly, for 8 Quality malls, it seems to be coming back. 
Looking at the stock repurchase program, in mid-April, as part of the previously announced $1.2 billion stock buyback approval, we entered into another accelerated stock repurchase program. We received 4.2 million shares when we started that program on February 18, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered at the conclusion of that program. On April 19, we completed the program and had an average share price to Macerish of $78.69. We received another 861,000 shares that have been retired. The total shares retired under both of the accelerated stock repurchase programs we've completed is now 10.2 million at an average share price of $78.48.
Looking out now at the FFO guidance in our press release, we reaffirmed our original guidance of 4.05 [ph] to 4.15. [ph] There's only 1 assumption change and that is in our initial guidance, we provided for the previously announced JV interest sales but we did not include any impact of non-core asset sales.  In April, however, we did so Capitola Mall. Capitola was a noncore asset for us, doing $350 a foot in sales and that was sold for $93 million. The Capitola sale will be dilutive to 2016 FFO by approximately $0.03 a share and that has now been factored into the guidance. So another way to look at the initial guidance is that it has been raised by $0.03. 
Other assumptions have remained unchanged and are detailed on Page 8 of our 8-K supplement that was filed yesterday afternoon. And just to remind you that our business in terms of FFO and NOI is seasonal and the quarterly FFO split we expect for the remainder of the year 23% of the yearly total in the second quarter, 26% in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

This reflects the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers. I'll start with occupancy. 
Occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.1%. This represents a 30 basis point year-over-year decline. With the sale of Capitola Mall, it's been excluded from the calculation while fashion outlets at Niagar Falls and South Park were included in the declarations having moved from the development portfolio into the stabilized portfolio. These 3 changes negatively impacted occupancy by 40 basis points. Absent these portfolio changes, the occupancy level on a year-over-year basis increased by 10 basis points. Temporary occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 5.5%.
Leasing spreads. Our leasing spreads increased to 15.4% from 14.2% during the previous quarter. These spreads indicate continued strong demand for space in the portfolio. As we've seen in previous quarters, our leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rents for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.44 per square foot. During the first quarter, a total of 733,000 square feet of leases were signed. The square footage of leases signed under 10,000 square feet was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Average term on the leases signed in the first quarter was 5.8 years. 
Portfolio sales were $625 per square foot. This represents a 3% increase on a year-over-year basis. The impact of the previously mentioned portfolio changes reduced sales by $13 per square foot.  
Comparable center sales increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis. And again, sales increased as were strongest in the West Coast centers. Categories that did well during the first quarter included beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear and athletic apparel, jewelry and restaurants.
Bankruptcies. As discussed on previous calls, we approach 2016 cautiously. During the first quarter, the level of bankruptcies and store closures was low. Subsequent to the first quarter, Pacsun entered bankruptcy. Our exposure to Pacsun has been reduced significantly since 2012 through dispositions in retenanting. In 2012, there were 36 Pacsun stores in our portfolio compared to 28 stores today. While too early to determine conclusively, we anticipate Pacsun will attempt to reorganize with a smaller store count. Pacsun represents approximately 1/2 of 1% of the company's gross rents with average sales of $333 per square foot. This is approximately half of the portfolio's sales average. Their base rent is $47 per square foot, which is $9 per square foot or 16% lower than the average base rent in place at the centers where Pacsun is located. 
The statistics for Aeropostale are similar. Since 2012, we have reduced the number stores with Aeropostale from 44 to 27. They represent approximately 1/2 of 1% of the company's gross rents. Sales are higher at $500 per square foot. We anticipate Aeropostale will reorganize with a smaller store count. 
Like expirations, we have witnessed that bankruptcies and store closures often present opportunities to improve the merchandise mix, increase sales productivity and generate higher rental income. While there is a short-term impact in terms of lost rent and tenant costs, long term, the releasing of these spaces puts the center in a stronger position and increases net income. 
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track and is nearing completion at 2 of the centers. At Broadway Plaza, we have signed leases for 89% of the expansion space with another 5% approved and in documentation. We've built a strong merchandise mix featuring a number of the leading lifestyle retailers and flagship stores to complement our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. The next group of new retailers will begin opening this June. Upon completion, Broadway Plaza will finally present sufficient specialty store space to service this unique trade area. 
You will notice in this quarter's supplement, the projected cost for Broadway Plaza was increased to $305 million. The increased cost, our share of which is $17.5 million, were the result of market conditions for construction in san Francisco, unforeseen sight conditions and increased scope for the project, which was generated from retailer demand. At an 8% stabilized return, the value creation from this development is substantial given the quality of the asset. 
At Green Acres Commons, we have signed leases for 90% of the center with another 2% approved and in documentation. You will also notice in this quarterly supplement the projected return on this project was increased by 100 basis points from 10% to 11%. This increase in the stabilized return is the result of higher than budgeted rental rates achieved during the lease up. 
Finally, leasing and construction are well underway for the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. We are pleased with the reception from the retail community to date and anticipate strong interest from retailers at the upcoming ICSC Show in Las Vegas. 
So looking forward, we expect retailer demand for the centers in our portfolio to remain high. Rental rates on renewal leases, which represent almost 2/3 of our annual activity, remains strong. Many of our core tenants, including categories such as cosmetics, health and beauty, intimate apparel, athletic footwear, optical and jewelry are growing their core brands and developing new concepts. There is increasing activity from established Taylor's seeking a physical presence in our centers. Foreign retailers are entering and expanding their existing store base in the U.S. And finally, larger format retailers continue to see expansion within the mall environment. So while we know not all retail chains will succeed, we are certain that dominant retail locations will.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

All are poised to deliver great growth for the year as well as incremental value for all of our shareholders. 
I want to talk a little bit about capital allocation strategies. It's something that has been top of mind on many analysts' minds lately, especially given the substantial disparity between the NAVs of most REIT and private market valuations and the discounts that REITs are trading at. 
Textbook theory would have you in situations like this sell at higher multiples into the private markets and use that capital to buy back your stock in the public markets at lower multiples, and that is exactly what Macerish has done. As you remember, we did our joint ventures. That were announced about 8 or 9 months ago. And we've just recently closed in this quarter. We sold about a 45% passive interest in several assets, 8 assets, that represented about 20% of the gross asset value of the company. So we sold an interest in around 9% to 10% of our view of the gross asset value of the company at private market multiples, which are significantly higher than public market multiples. We took that capital and we announced a buyback program that would have us buying back approximately 10% of our stock in the public markets at significantly lower multiples, all with an idea towards capturing that differential. 
So we think that in a very meaningful way, that we have pursued a capital allocation strategy that makes all the sense in the world at this point in the cycle and at this point in time for Macerish. A collateral issue and related issue is portfolio management. We have indicated that we will continue to selectively prune our portfolio. And in this quarter, we were successful in announcing the sale of Capitola Mall. This -- Capitola was a center that averaged mid-$300 per foot. It's a very good property but it had not shown the types of growth characteristics that some of our more urban assets have shown for us. And when you combine the sale of Capitola Mall and Panorama Mall about 6 months ago, we sold 2 centers that average in the low $300 a foot for cap rates that were in the low 6s to the mid-6s. We raised about $200 million of equity from that. And if you want to think about it from a portfolio management viewpoint, in our mind, that was the capital that we redeployed into the purchase of a 50% [ph] interest in Country Club Plaza, which is a center that obviously has much greater growth characteristics than the centers we sold. And from a sales productivity view point, it does more than double the sales per foot of the 2 centers we sold.
Going forward, from a productivity viewpoint and a disposition viewpoint, we will continue to prune our portfolio. We will use that lower bucket of assets to selectively and opportunistically raise capital going forward. And we see the use of that capital really to be our source of capital or one of our sources of capital to fund our highly profitable redevelopment and development pipelines. 
And now I want to look to comment on our view of retail demand and the convergence of technology and real estate, which we think is something that is clearly going to happen this year.
Our view on retail demand as we've gotten into the year has only gotten to be more optimistic. Early on in the year when we were very forthright about our view on tenant bankruptcy, some folks view that as being cautious. I'd say, it was really more forthright. Over the past several months, we've spent a lot of time talking to digital companies, companies that currently do not do business in our malls, and we found that their appetite to experiment with stores at our malls is extremely high. It's not about online versus offline anymore in the shopper's mind. It's all about the quality of the brand. And if you have a brand that shoppers want, then shoppers do expect to be able to access that brands anywhere, anytime, any multiple manors through an omni-channel opportunity.
Retailers continue to understand the importance between e-commerce, bricks and mortar and brand awareness. Rarely do we see that retailers not liking these 3 concepts together as they build out the retail platform. There is increasing activity from established retailers seeking a physical presence. While small in terms of magnitude within the portfolio, the opportunity for growth is high, especially in better quality urban shopping centers. 
We believe that stores that -- we believe that stores located in centers that serve densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance as there is this convergence of tech and brick-and-mortar. A recently published study indicated that within a 30-minute drive time of Macerich malls, there's about an average a 1.9 million people that reside. That's about 50% greater than the average for the broader peer group. 
That's by design. We set out by design several years ago to concentrate on urban densely populated trade areas. We did this for many reasons. One of them has to do with just the fundamentals of supply and demand. If you have a property that is in an urban location, it is very hard for competition to come in and impact you. And most of all of our urban locations are must-have retail locations. Retailers and retailers as they think about it, they look at the dense population that we have around our shopping centers, and they see our shopping centers as the being their vehicle to serve the last mile to their ultimate shopper to the consumer. We're thinking about pockets of opportunities to give access to our shopping centers for smaller digital retailers and we believe after meeting with many of them over the past several months and devoting a tremendous amount of time and attention to this, that our very high barrier to entry, shopping centers are also greatly in demand from the digital retailers of the world. Now it's up to us to lower the barriers for them to figure out ways to do business with us and to reduce the friction that is involved in them opening a store and we have several initiatives that are underway. That will be developed and discussed further as the year goes on. 
And with that, I would like to open it up for questions and operator, please go ahead."

It's all being -- first of all, there is going to be no rule of thumb because if there is, then we're going to continue to have a difficult approach. So we're going to have to be just as creative as the people that we're trying to do business with. So in the beginning, there will be short term these terms, there'll be pop up stores that will be initiated. There'll be some rents that we think are really being paid for out of the marketing budget of the retailer, where they're looking to try and extend their brand awareness. It'll be a much more creative and approachable lease structure with the hope and a view that as these retailers pan out, that they will essentially have become incubated and then they'll be migrated into the more traditional long-term relationship that we have with the vast majority of our tenants. But we see great opportunity here. And the thing that I would say is that my personal view on this, is significantly more positive today than it was 3 months ago, and that's really a function of me personally, along with Eric, who I mentioned was appointed to be Head of our Strategic Initiatives, spending a significant amount of time with early-stage founders of e-tail concepts, people that are some probably between an Angels series and a series A financing that are just beginning to think about opening a store. They've had some success online. They have a brand that people seem to like a lot. And when you meet with these folks, you go into in the beginning I said, I wonder if this is going to be difficult conversation to convince them that they should be in this old-school shopping mall. It's just the opposite. There's been almost a 100% success and conversion rate in the conversations. Their appetite to be in the malls is just without question. They realize that these are the premier locations to give awareness to their brand, to get access to the customers. But the truth of the matter is that while our malls are high barrier to entry, at times, the way we do business is also high barrier. So we have to become a little more flexible to the e-tailers to provide flexible ways for them to experiment selectively in the malls. Look, we're not going to dedicate 20% of any given malls to these emerging e-tailers, but there could be percentage, there could be 5%, maybe 10%, I don't know. We'll see. But the acceptance ratio and the quality of the conversations and the conversions into deals is causing me to be very optimistic and very convinced that 2016 is the year where tech and real estate come together. Everybody likes to refer to where we are in the economy, et cetera. In baseball terms these days now that baseball season is in full swing, and I would say, we're in the first inning, the top of the first inning in terms of the conversions of tech to brick-and-mortar, but that's the good news. I mean we had a whole game to play this out. But the early results are really strong in my view, moving the needle financially in the early days here. But it is going to create incremental demand, incremental excitement for our shoppers and I believe that it's going to change the face of our shopping centers going forward. To be determined, to be watched as time goes on, but I sit here today very bullish and optimistic about the opportunity here."

We'll bring it back into the shadow pipeline and the real pipeline. My guess is next time it comes back, it will be the real pipeline, not the shadow. As far as Candlestick goes, everything is proceeding well there. Our anticipation is that, that will open in late 2019 and could be earlier than that, but I -- I'm not -- I doubt it. It's a very big development surrounding us. And so, there's tremendous amounts of infrastructure that are being put into place to enable the shopping center to exist, things that we don't control.

So unlike a lot of companies that lever up to do the buyback, we raised capital ahead of time. In terms of the line, I mentioned a couple of financings. We're pulling a substantial amount of excess proceeds out of the Northridge financing for example. We'll do the same at somewhere. And in addition, given the great financing market, we'll probably go to larger markets on whatever, which is currently unencumbered and that's about $340 million of proceeds that would then be used to pay down the line of credit.

Consistent with past practice, we'll be limiting this call to 1 hour.

Consistent with past practice, we'll be limiting this call to 1 hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call.
The first quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. We continued to execute on our previously announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also recently completed the sale of a noncore mall. We'll talk about those in greater detail later on the call.
For the quarter, FFO was $0.87 compared to $0.79 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Negatively impacting the quarterly FFO results was $3.5 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt on the prepayment of the Arrowhead Towne Center loan in January.
Other things impacting the quarter were same-center NOI, which increased by 7.5% compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made significant expense cuts and initiated cost-savings programs that started in the second quarter of '15. So about 1/3 of the same-center NOI growth this quarter comes from the impact of those expense cuts compared to the first quarter of last year.
The balance of the growth was driven by double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. Same-center NOI growth in the balance -- for the balance of the year will obviously be less than the first quarter as we hit comp quarters that already had the impact of the expense cuts. Our estimate for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range.
Gross operating margin at the centers for the quarter improved to 68.6% from 66.6% in the first quarter of last year. That debt expense was relatively modest at $1.2 million, down from $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year. As a result of a very attractive financing market, the average interest rate continues to be very low at 3.62%, although up slightly from 3.49% a year ago. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, debt to market cap was 35.8%. The interest coverage ratio was a very healthy 3.5x; debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; and the average debt maturity, 6.14 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. In addition to closing the previously announced Arrowhead Towne Center loan in January, we have closed or committed on 2 other life company loans, and we're in the market with a third. 
Subsequent our purchase of Country Club Plaza, we put a $320 million loan in place. That's 10 years, fixed, with an interest rate of 3.85%. 
We also committed to a $375 million loan at The Shops at North bridge. That's a 12-year fixed-rate loan. The rate is locked at 3.68%, and we should have closed that loan in the next few weeks. That refi will pay off the existing loan, which is $189 million with an interest rate of 7.5%. So we're effectively doubling the size of the loan and cut the interest rate in half.
We're also currently in the market for financing Corte Madera. And in addition to very attractive life company bids, we're also seeing some very competitive CMBS bids, and that's for the first time in the past 6 months or so. And again, these are A-quality malls. I'm not sure that the CMBS market exists for all property types and qualities. But certainly, for A-quality malls, it seems to be coming back.
Looking at the stock repurchase program. In mid-April, as part of the previously announced $1.2 billion stock buyback approval, we entered into another accelerated stock repurchase program. We received 4.2 million shares when we started that program on February 18, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered at the conclusion of that program. On April 19, we completed the program and had an average share price to Macerich of $78.69. We received another 861,000 shares that have been retired. The total shares retired under both of the accelerated stock repurchase programs we've completed is now 10.2 million at an average share price of $78.48.
Looking out now at the FFO guidance. In our press release, we reaffirmed our original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15. There is only one assumption change. And that is in our initial guidance, we provided for the previously announced JV interest sales, but we did not include any impact of noncore asset sales. In April, however, we did sell Capitola Mall. Capitola is a -- it was a noncore asset for us doing $350 a foot in sales, and that was sold for $93 million. The Capitola sale will be dilutive to 2016 FFO by approximately $0.03 a share, and that has now been factored into the guidance. So another way to look at the initial guidance is that it has been raised by $0.03.
Other assumptions have remained unchanged and are detailed on Page 8 of our 8-K supplement that was filed yesterday afternoon. And just to remind you that our business in terms of FFO and NOI is seasonal. And the quarterly FFO split we expect is, for the remainder of the year, 23% of the yearly total in the second quarter, 26% in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

This reflects the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers. I'll start with occupancy.
Occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.1%. This represents a 30 basis point year-over-year decline. With the sale of Capitola Mall, it's been excluded from the calculation, while fashion outlets at Niagara Falls and SouthPark were included in the calculations, having moved from the development portfolio into the stabilized portfolio. These 3 changes negatively impacted occupancy by 40 basis points. Absent these portfolio changes, the occupancy level on a year-over-year basis increased by 10 basis points. Temporary occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 5.5%.
Leasing spreads. Our leasing spreads increased to 15.4% from 14.2% during the previous quarter. These spreads indicate continued strong demand for space in the portfolio. As we've seen in previous quarters, our leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.44 per square foot. During the first quarter, a total of 733,000 square feet of leases were signed. The square footage of leases signed under 10,000 square feet was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Average term of the leases signed in the first quarter was 5.8 years. 
Portfolio sales were $625 per square foot. This represents a 3% increase on a year-over-year basis. The impact of the previously mentioned portfolio changes reduced sales by $13 per square foot.
Comparable center sales increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis. And again, sales increased as we're strongest in the West Coast centers. Categories that did well during the first quarter included beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear and athletic apparel, jewelry and restaurants.
Bankruptcies. As discussed on previous calls, we approach 2016 cautiously. During the first quarter, the level of bankruptcies and store closures was low. Subsequent to the first quarter, PacSun entered bankruptcy. Our exposure to PacSun has been reduced significantly since 2012 through dispositions in retenanting. 
In 2012, there were 36 PacSun stores in our portfolio compared to 28 stores today. While too early to determine conclusively, we anticipate PacSun will attempt to reorganize with a smaller store count. PacSun represents approximately 1/2 of 1% of the company's gross rents with average sales of $333 per square foot. This is approximately half of the portfolio's sales average. Their base rent is $47 per square foot, which is $9 per square foot or 16% lower than the average base rent in place at the centers where PacSun is located.
The statistics for Aeropostale are similar. Since 2012, we have reduced the number stores with Aeropostale from 44 to 27. They represent approximately 1/2 of 1% of the company's gross rents. Sales are higher at $500 per square foot. We anticipate Aeropostale will reorganize with a smaller store count.
Like expirations, we have witnessed that bankruptcies and store closures often present opportunities to improve the merchandise mix, increase sales productivity and generate higher rental income. While there is a short-term impact in terms of lost rent and retenanting costs, long term, the re-leasing of these spaces puts the center in a stronger position and increases net income.
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track and is nearing completion at 2 of the centers. At Broadway Plaza, we have signed leases for 89% of the expansion space, with another 5% approved and in documentation. We've built a strong merchandise mix featuring a number of the leading lifestyle retailers and flagship stores to complement our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. The next group of new retailers will begin opening this June. Upon completion, Broadway Plaza will finally present sufficient specialty store space to serve this unique trade area.
You will notice in this quarter's supplement the projected cost for Broadway Plaza was increased to $305 million. The increased costs, our share of which is $17.5 million, were the result of market conditions for construction in San Francisco, unforeseen site conditions and increased scope for the project, which was generated from retailer demand. At an 8% stabilized return, the value from -- creation from this development is substantial given the quality of the asset. 
At Green Acres Commons, we have signed leases for 90% of the center, with another 2% approved and in documentation. You will also notice in this quarterly supplement the projected return on this project was increased by 100 basis points from 10% to 11%. This increase in the stabilized return is the result of higher-than-budgeted rental rates achieved during the lease-up.
Finally, leasing and construction are well underway for the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. We are pleased with the reception from the retail community to date and anticipate strong interest from retailers at the upcoming ICSC show in Las Vegas.
So looking forward, we expect retailer demand for the centers in our portfolio to remain high. Rental rates on renewal leases, which represent almost 2/3 of our annual activity, remain strong. Many of our core tenants, including categories such as cosmetics, health and beauty, intimate apparel, athletic footwear, optical and jewelry, are growing their core brands and developing new concepts. There is increasing activity from established e-tailers seeking a physical presence in our centers. Foreign retailers are entering and expanding their existing store base in the U.S. And finally, larger-format retailers continue to see expansion within the mall environment. So while we know not all retail chains will succeed, we are certain that dominant retail locations will.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

As you can tell from reading our earnings release, we had a terrific start to the year on all fronts: financial fronts, the operating results, re-leasing and leasing activity as well as the further progression of our development pipeline. All are poised to deliver great growth for the year as well as incremental value for all of our shareholders.
I want to talk a little bit about capital allocation strategies. It's something that has been top of mind on many analysts' minds lately, especially given the substantial disparity between the NAVs of most REITs and the private market valuations and the discounts that REITs are trading at.
Textbook theory would have you in situations like this sell at higher multiples into the private markets and use that capital to buy back your stock in the public markets at lower multiples. And that is exactly what Macerich has done. As you remember, we did our joint ventures that were announced about 8 or 9 months ago and then have just recently closed in this quarter. We sold about a 45% passive interest in several assets -- 8 assets that represented about 20% of the gross asset value of the company. So we sold an interest in around 9% to 10% of our view of the gross asset value of the company at private market multiples which are significantly higher than public market multiples. We took that capital, and we announced the buyback program that would have us buying back approximately 10% of our stock in the public markets at significantly lower multiples, all with an idea towards capturing that differential.
So we think that in a very meaningful way that we have pursued a capital allocation strategy that makes all the sense in the world at this point in the cycle and at this point in time for Macerich. A collateral issue and related issue is portfolio management. We have indicated that we will continue to selectively prune our portfolio. 
And in this quarter, we were successful in announcing the sale of Capitola Mall. This -- Capitola was a center that averaged mid-$300 per foot. It's a very good property, but it had not shown the types of growth characteristics that some of our more urban assets have shown for us. And when you combine the sale of Capitola Mall and Panorama Mall about 6 months ago, we sold 2 centers that averaged in the low $300 a foot for cap rates that were in the low 6s to the mid-6s. We raised about $200 million of equity from that. And if you want to think about it from a portfolio management viewpoint, in our mind, that was the capital that we redeployed into the purchase of a 50% interest in Country Club Plaza, which is a center that obviously has much greater growth characteristics than the centers we sold. And from a sales productivity viewpoint, it does more than double the sales per foot of the 2 centers that we sold.
Going forward, from a productivity viewpoint and a disposition viewpoint, we will continue to prune our portfolio. We will use that lower bucket of assets to selectively and opportunistically raise capital going forward. And we see the use of that capital really to be our source of capital -- or one of our sources of capital to fund our highly profitable redevelopment and development pipelines.
And now I want to look to comment on our view of retail demand and the convergence of technology and real estate, which we think is something that is clearly going to happen this year.
Our view on retail demand as we have gotten into the year has only gotten to be more optimistic. Early on in the year when we were very forthright about our view on tenant bankruptcy, some folks viewed that as being cautious. I'd say it was really more forthright. 
Over the past several months, we have spent a lot of time talking to digital companies, companies that currently do not do business in our malls, and we found that their appetite to experiment with stores at our malls is extremely high. It's not about online versus offline anymore in the shopper's mind. It's all about the quality of the brand. And if you have a brand that shoppers want, then shoppers do expect to be able to access that brand anywhere, anytime in multiple manners through an omni-channel opportunity.
Retailers continue to understand the importance between e-commerce, bricks and mortar and brand awareness. Rarely do we see that retailers not liking these 3 concepts together as they build out their retail platform. There is increasing activity from established e-tailers seeking a physical presence. While small in terms of magnitude within the portfolio, the opportunity for growth is high, especially in better-quality urban shopping centers. 
We believe that stores that are -- we believe that stores located in centers that serve densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance as there is this convergence of tech and brick and mortar. A recently published study indicated that within a 30-minute drive time of Macerich malls, there's about, on average, 1.9 million people that reside. That's about 50% greater than the average for the broader peer group.
That's by design. We set out by design several years ago to concentrate on urban, densely populated trade areas. We did this for many reasons. One of them has to do with just the fundamentals of supply and demand. If you have a property that is in an urban location, it is very hard for competition to come in and impact you. 
And most of all of our urban locations are must-have retail locations. Retailers and e-tailers as they think about it, they look at the dense population that we have around our shopping centers, and they see our shopping centers as the being their vehicle to serve the last mile to their ultimate shopper to the consumer. 
We're thinking about lots of opportunities to give access to our shopping centers for smaller digital retailers. And we believe, after meeting with many of them over the past several months and devoting a tremendous amount of time and attention to this, that our very high barrier to entry shopping centers are also greatly in demand from the digital retailers of the world. Now it's up to us to lower the barriers for them to figure out ways to do business with us and to reduce the friction that is involved in them opening a store, and we have several initiatives that are underway. That will be developed and discussed further as the year goes on.
And with that, I would like to open it up for questions. And operator, please go ahead."

Because if there is, then we're going to continue to have to be difficult to approach. So we're going to have to be just as creative as the people that we're trying to do business with. So in the beginning, there will be shorter lease terms. There'll be pop-up stores that will be initiated. There'll be some rents that we think are really being paid for out of the marketing budget of the retailer, where they're looking to try and extend their brand awareness. It'll be a much more creative and approachable lease structure with a hope and a view that as these retailers pan out, that they will essentially have become incubated, and then they'll be migrated into the more traditional long-term relationship that we have with the vast majority of our tenants. But we see great opportunity here. And the thing that I would say is that my personal view on this is significantly more positive today than it was 3 months ago. And that's really a function of me personally, along with Eric, who, I mentioned, was appointed to be Head of our Strategic Initiatives, spending a significant amount of time with early-stage founders of e-tail concepts, people that are somewhere probably between the an Angels series and a series A financing that are just beginning to think about opening a store. They've had some success online. They have a brand that people seem to like a lot. And when you meet with these folks, you go into it in the beginning. And I said, I wonder if this is going to be a difficult conversation to convince them that they should be in this old-school shopping mall. It's just the opposite. There's been almost a 100% success and conversion rate in the conversations. Their appetite to be in the malls is just without question. They realized that these are the premier locations to give awareness to their brand, to get access to the customers. But the truth of the matter is that while our malls are high barrier to entry, at times, the way we do business is also high barrier. So we have to become a little more flexible, a little more sue the e-tailers to provide flexible ways for them to experiment selectively in the malls. Look, we're not going to dedicate 20% of any given mall to these emerging e-tailers, but there could be percentage. There could be 5%, maybe 10%, I don't know, we'll see. But the acceptance ratio and the quality of the conversations and the conversions into deals is causing me to be very optimistic and very convinced that 2016 is the year where tech and real estate come together. Everybody likes to refer to where we are in the economy, et cetera. In baseball terms these days, now that baseball season is in full swing. And I would say, we're in the first inning -- the top of the first inning in terms of the conversions of tech to brick and mortar. But that's the good news. I mean, we had a whole game to play this out. But the early results are really strong in my view, moving the needle financially in the early days here. But it is going to create incremental demand, incremental excitement for our shoppers. And it's -- I believe that it's going to change the face of our shopping centers going forward. To be determined, to be watched as time goes on, but I sit here today very bullish and optimistic about the opportunity here."

As far as Candlestick goes, everything is proceeding well there. Our anticipation is that, that will open in late 2019 and could be earlier than that, but I -- I'm not -- I doubt it. It's a very big development surrounding us. And so there's tremendous amounts of infrastructure that are being put into place to enable the shopping center to exist, things that we don't control.

But the truth -- the other flip side of that is Chicago is -- has highest real estate taxes in the country. That doesn't drive retailers away from doing business in Chicago. They just accept the fact that if they're going to do business in Chicago, they're going to pay high real estate taxes. Santa Monica, let's say, it has a living wage that's enacted here.

That's unencumbered today, and we have very little NOI coming in from there. So that's going to come up. At the end of the day, we're not going to be taking leverage up much at all. Remember, we prefunded the buyback with the $2.3 billion we generated by selling the joint venture interest. So unlike a lot of companies that lever up to do the buyback, we already raised the capital ahead of time. In terms of the line, I mentioned a couple of financings. We're pulling a substantial amount of excess proceeds out of the North Bridge financing, for example. We'll do the same in Corte Madera. And in addition, given the great financing market, we will probably go to a long-term mortgage on Fresno Fashion Fair, which is currently unencumbered. And that's about $340 million of proceeds that would then be used to pay down the line of credit. So we expect even after a third ASR or however we choose to do it to get the buyback up to the $1.2 billion, that we would have a line that would vary between $500 million and $1 billion, which is comfortable for us given that we can take that line all the way up to $2 billion."

If you're talking about what does a digitally born retailer think about, I think they think about the last mile. They don't necessarily think about high end because a lot of the goods that digital retailers are selling are not high end. And so I do think they think about where would I like to be, the where I can get -- in the digital world, they think about eyeballs. In the physical world, they think about foot fall. So where can I go that's got a lot of foot traffic? Where can I go where retailers are proven winners? Where can I go that is in the heart of a densely populated trade area? All of the -- those factors that I think will influence where the e-tailers of the world will want to initially migrate really puts us in a perfect position to service their needs. Now how far will they go beyond that? Time will tell. I mean, there's one case to be made in my mind that certain digital retailers will actually be -- will do really well in secondary and even tertiary markets, where they can access a market and provide an exciting retail experience to that market that, that market normally -- that those shoppers wouldn't otherwise be exposed to. Time will tell. But I'm absolutely convinced the convergence is happening. If I had to put it in terms of where we are in the cycle, like I said, the first inning.

Consistent with past practice, we'll be limiting this call to 1 hour.

Consistent with past practice, we'll be limiting this call to 1 hour. If we run out of time and you still have questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call.
The first quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. We continued to execute on our previously announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also recently completed the sale of a noncore mall. We'll talk about those in greater detail later on the call.
For the quarter, FFO was $0.87 compared to $0.79 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Negatively impacting the quarterly FFO results was $3.5 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt on the prepayment of the Arrowhead Towne Center loan in January.
Other things impacting the quarter were same-center NOI, which increased by 7.5% compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made significant expense cuts and initiated cost-savings programs that started in the second quarter of '15. So about 1/3 of the same-center NOI growth this quarter comes from the impact of those expense cuts compared to the first quarter of last year.
The balance of the growth was driven by double-digit re-leasing spreads, annual rent increases and aggressive operating cost management. Same-center NOI growth in the balance -- for the balance of the year will obviously be less than the first quarter as we hit comp quarters that already had the impact of the expense cuts. Our estimate for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range.
Gross operating margin at the centers for the quarter improved to 68.6% from 66.6% in the first quarter of last year. That debt expense was relatively modest at $1.2 million, down from $1.6 million in the first quarter of last year. As a result of a very attractive financing market, the average interest rate continues to be very low at 3.62%, although up slightly from 3.49% a year ago. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, debt-to-market cap was 35.8%. The interest coverage ratio was a very healthy 3.5x; debt to EBITDA on a forward basis, 7.2x; and the average debt maturity, 6.14 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. In addition to closing the previously announced Arrowhead Towne Center loan in January, we have closed or committed on 2 other life company loans, and we're in the market with a third. 
Subsequent our purchase of Country Club Plaza, we put a $320 million loan in place. That's 10 years, fixed, with an interest rate of 3.85%. 
We also committed to a $375 million loan at The Shops at North Bridge. That's a 12-year fixed-rate loan. The rate is locked at 3.68%, and we should close that loan in the next few weeks. That refi will pay off the existing loan, which is $189 million with an interest rate of 7.5%. So we're effectively doubling the size of the loan and cut the interest rate in half.
We're also currently in the market for financing Corte Madera. And in addition to very attractive life company bids, we're also seeing some very competitive CMBS bids, and that's for the first time in the past 6 months or so. And again, these are A-quality malls. I'm not sure that the CMBS market exists for all property types and qualities. But certainly, for A-quality malls, it seems to be coming back.
Looking at the stock repurchase program. In mid-April, as part of the previously announced $1.2 billion stock buyback approval, we entered into another accelerated stock repurchase program. We received 4.2 million shares when we started that program on February 18, and the balance of the shares were to be delivered at the conclusion of that program. On April 19, we completed the program and had an average share price to Macerich of $78.69. We received another 861,000 shares that have been retired. The total shares retired under both of the accelerated stock repurchase programs we've completed is now 10.2 million at an average share price of $78.48.
Looking now at the FFO guidance. In our press release, we reaffirmed our original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15. There is only one assumption change and that is in our initial guidance, we provided for the previously announced JV interest sales, but we did not include any impact of noncore asset sales. In April, however, we did sell Capitola Mall. Capitola is a -- it was a noncore asset for us doing $350 a foot in sales, and that was sold for $93 million. The Capitola sale will be dilutive to 2016 FFO by approximately $0.03 a share, and that has now been factored into the guidance. So another way to look at the initial guidance is that it has been raised by $0.03.
Other assumptions have remained unchanged and are detailed on Page 8 of our 8-K supplement that was filed yesterday afternoon. And just to remind you that our business in terms of FFO and NOI is seasonal. And the quarterly FFO split we expect is, for the remainder of the year, 23% of the yearly total in the second quarter, 26% in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

This reflects the high-quality nature of the company's shopping centers. I'll start with occupancy.
Occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.1%. This represents a 30 basis point year-over-year decline. With the sale of Capitola Mall, it's been excluded from the calculation, while fashion outlets at Niagara Falls and SouthPark were included in the calculations, having moved from the development portfolio into the stabilized portfolio. These 3 changes negatively impacted occupancy by 40 basis points. Absent these portfolio changes, the occupancy level on a year-over-year basis increased by 10 basis points. Temporary occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 5.5%.
Leasing spreads. Our leasing spreads increased to 15.4% from 14.2% during the previous quarter. These spreads indicate continued strong demand for space in the portfolio. As we've seen in previous quarters, our leasing spreads were strongest in the East and West Coast centers. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.44 per square foot. During the first quarter, a total of 733,000 square feet of leases were signed. The square footage of leases signed under 10,000 square feet was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Average term of the leases signed in the first quarter was 5.8 years. 
Portfolio sales were $625 per square foot. This represents a 3% increase on a year-over-year basis. The impact of the previously mentioned portfolio changes reduced sales by $13 per square foot.
Comparable center sales increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis. And again, sales increases were strongest in the West Coast centers. Categories that did well during the first quarter included beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear and athletic apparel, jewelry and restaurants.
Bankruptcies. As discussed on previous calls, we approached 2016 cautiously. During the first quarter, the level of bankruptcies and store closures was low. Subsequent to the first quarter, PacSun entered bankruptcy. Our exposure to PacSun has been reduced significantly since 2012 through dispositions in retenanting. 
In 2012, there were 36 PacSun stores in our portfolio compared to 28 stores today. While too early to determine conclusively, we anticipate PacSun will attempt to reorganize with a smaller store count. PacSun represents approximately 1/2 of 1% of the company's gross rents with average sales of $333 per square foot. This is approximately 1/2 of the portfolio's sales average. Their base rent is $47 per square foot, which is $9 per square foot or 16% lower than the average base rent in place at the centers where PacSun is located.
The statistics for Aeropostale are similar. Since 2012, we have reduced the number stores with Aeropostale from 44 to 27. They represent approximately 1/2 of 1% of the company's gross rents. Sales are higher at $500 per square foot. We anticipate Aeropostale will reorganize with a smaller store count.
Like expirations, we have witnessed that bankruptcies and store closures often present opportunities to improve the merchandise mix, increase sales productivity and generate higher rental income. While there is a short-term impact in terms of lost rent and retenanting costs, long term, the re-leasing of these spaces puts the center in a stronger position and increases net income.
Development. Leasing at the development projects remains on track and is nearing completion at 2 of the centers. At Broadway Plaza, we have signed leases for 89% of the expansion space, with another 5% approved and in documentation. We've built a strong merchandise mix featuring a number of the leading lifestyle retailers and flagship stores to complement our existing anchors of Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus. The next group of new retailers will begin opening this June. Upon completion, Broadway Plaza will finally present sufficient specialty store space to serve this unique trade area.
You will notice in this quarter's supplement the projected cost for Broadway Plaza was increased to $305 million. The increased costs, our share of which is $17.5 million, were the result of market conditions for construction in San Francisco, unforeseen site conditions and increased scope for the project, which was generated from retailer demand. At an 8% stabilized return, the value from -- creation from this development is substantial given the quality of the asset. 
At Green Acres Commons, we have signed leases for 90% of the center, with another 2% approved and in documentation. You will also notice in this quarterly supplement the projected return on this project was increased by 100 basis points from 10% to 11%. This increase in the stabilized return is the result of higher-than-budgeted rental rates achieved during the lease-up.
Finally, leasing and construction are well underway for the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. We are pleased with the reception from the retail community to date and anticipate strong interest from retailers at the upcoming ICSC show in Las Vegas.
So looking forward, we expect retailer demand for the centers in our portfolio to remain high. Rental rates on renewal leases, which represent almost 2/3 of our annual activity, remain strong. Many of our core tenants, including categories such as cosmetics, health and beauty, intimate apparel, athletic footwear, optical and jewelry, are growing their core brands and developing new concepts. There is increasing activity from established e-tailers seeking a physical presence in our centers. Foreign retailers are entering and expanding their existing store base in the U.S. And finally, larger-format retailers continue to see expansion within the mall environment. So while we know not all retail chains will succeed, we are certain that dominant retail locations will.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

Thanks, Tom, and welcome to the call. As you can tell from reading our earnings release, we have a terrific start to the year on all fronts: financial fronts, the operating results, re-leasing and leasing activity as well as the further progression of our development pipeline. All are poised to deliver great growth for the year as well as incremental value for all of our shareholders.
I want to talk a little bit about capital allocation strategies. It's something that has been top of mind on many analysts' minds lately, especially given the substantial disparity between the NAVs of most REITs and the private market valuations and the discounts that REITs are trading at.
Textbook theory would have you in situations like this sell at higher multiples into the private markets and use that capital to buy back your stock in the public markets at lower multiples. And that is exactly what Macerich has done. As you remember, we did our joint ventures that were announced about 8 or 9 months ago and that have just recently closed in this quarter. We sold about a 45% passive interest in several assets -- 8 assets that represented about 20% of the gross asset value of the company. So we sold an interest in around 9% to 10% of our view of the gross asset value of the company at private market multiples which are significantly higher than public market multiples. We took that capital, and we announced the buyback program that would have us buying back approximately 10% of our stock in the public markets at significantly lower multiples, all with an idea towards capturing that differential.
So we think that in a very meaningful way that we have pursued a capital allocation strategy that makes all the sense in the world at this point in the cycle and at this point in time for Macerich. A collateral issue and related issue is portfolio management. We have indicated that we will continue to selectively prune our portfolio. 
And in this quarter, we were successful in announcing the sale of Capitola Mall. This -- Capitola was a center that averaged mid-$300 per foot. It's a very good property, but it had not shown the types of growth characteristics that some of our more urban assets have shown up for us. And when you combine the sale of Capitola Mall and Panorama Mall about 6 months ago, we sold 2 centers that averaged in the low $300 a foot for cap rates that were in the low 6s to the mid-6s. We raised about $200 million of equity from that. And if you want to think about it from a portfolio management viewpoint, in our mind, that was the capital that we redeployed into the purchase of a 50% interest in Country Club Plaza, which is a center that obviously has much greater growth characteristics than the centers we sold. And from a sales productivity viewpoint, it does more than double the sales per foot of the 2 centers that we sold.
Going forward, from a productivity viewpoint and a disposition viewpoint, we will continue to prune our portfolio. We will use that lower bucket of assets to selectively and opportunistically raise capital going forward. And we see the use of that capital really to be our source of capital -- or one of our sources of capital to fund our highly profitable redevelopment and development pipelines.
And now I want to look to comment on our view of retail demand and the convergence of technology and real estate, which we think is something that is clearly going to happen this year.
Our view on retail demand as we have gotten into the year has only gotten to be more optimistic. Early on in the year when we were very forthright about our view on tenant bankruptcy, some folks viewed that as being cautious. I'd say it was really more forthright. 
Over the past several months, we've spent a lot of time talking to digital companies, companies that currently do not do business in our malls, and we found that their appetite to experiment with stores at our malls is extremely high. It's not about online versus offline anymore in the shopper's mind. It's all about the quality of the brand. And if you have a brand that shoppers want, then shoppers do expect to be able to access that brand anywhere, anytime in multiple manners through an omni-channel opportunity.
Retailers continue to understand the importance between e-commerce, bricks and mortar and brand awareness. Rarely do we see that retailers are not linking these 3 concepts together as they build out their retail platform. There is increasing activity from established e-tailers seeking a physical presence. While small in terms of magnitude within the portfolio, the opportunity for growth is high, especially in better-quality urban shopping centers. 
We believe that stores that are -- we believe the stores located in centers that serve densely populated trade areas will benefit the most and increase in importance as there is this convergence of tech and brick and mortar. A recently published study indicated that within a 30-minute drive time of Macerich malls, there's about, on average, 1.9 million people that reside. That's about 50% greater than the average for the broader peer group.
That's by design. We set out by design several years ago to concentrate on urban, densely populated trade areas. We did this for many reasons. One of them has to do with just the fundamentals of supply and demand. If you have a property that is in an urban location, it is very hard for competition to come in and impact you. 
And most of all of our urban locations are must-have retail locations. Retailers and e-tailers as they think about it, they look at the dense population that we have around our shopping centers, and they see our shopping centers as the being their vehicle to serve the last mile to their ultimate shopper to the consumer. 
We're thinking about lots of opportunities to give access to our shopping centers for smaller digital retailers. And we believe, after meeting with many of them over the past several months and devoting a tremendous amount of time and attention to this, that our very high barrier to entry shopping centers are also greatly in demand from the digital retailers of the world. Now it's up to us to lower the barriers for them to figure out ways to do business with us and to reduce the friction that is involved in them opening a store, and we have several initiatives that are underway. That will be developed and discussed further as the year goes on.
And with that, I would like to open it up for questions. And operator, please go ahead."

Because if there is, then we're going to continue to have -- be difficult to approach. So we're going to have to be just as creative as the people that we're trying to do business with. So in the beginning, there will be shorter lease terms. There'll be pop-up stores that will be initiated. There'll be some rents that we think are really being paid for out of the marketing budget of the retailer, where they're looking to try and extend their brand awareness. It'll be a much more creative and approachable lease structure with a hope and a view that as these retailers pan out, that they will essentially have become incubated, and then they'll be migrated into the more traditional long-term relationship that we have with the vast majority of our tenants. But we see great opportunity here. And the thing that I would say is that my personal view on this is significantly more positive today than it was 3 months ago. And that's really a function of me personally, along with Eric, who, I mentioned, was appointed to be Head of our Strategic Initiatives, spending a significant amount of time with early-stage founders of e-tail concepts, people that are somewhere probably between the -- an angel series and a series A financing that are just beginning to think about opening a store. They've had some success online. They have a brand that people seem to like a lot. And when you meet with these folks, you go into it in the beginning. And I said, I wonder if this is going to be a difficult conversation to convince them that they should be in this old-school shopping mall. It's just the opposite. There's been almost a 100% success and conversion rate in the conversations. Their appetite to be in the malls is just without question. They realize that these are the premier locations to give awareness to their brand, to get access to the customers. But the truth of the matter is that while our malls are high barrier to entry, at times, the way we do business is also a high barrier. So we have to become a little more flexible, a little more through [ph] the e-tailers to provide flexible ways for them to experiment selectively in the malls. Look, we're not going to dedicate 20% of any given mall to these emerging e-tailers, but there could be percentage. There could be 5%, maybe 10%, I don't know, we'll see. But the acceptance ratio and the quality of the conversations and the conversions into deals is causing me to be very optimistic and very convinced that 2016 is the year where tech and real estate come together. Everybody likes to refer to where we are in the economy, et cetera. In baseball terms these days, now that baseball season is in full swing. And I would say, we're in the first inning -- the top of the first inning in terms of the conversions of tech to brick and mortar. But that's the good news. I mean, we've got a whole game to play this out. But the early results are really strong in my view, moving the needle financially in the early days here. But it is going to create incremental demand, incremental excitement for our shoppers. And it's -- I believe that it's going to change the face of our shopping centers going forward. To be determined, to be watched as time goes on, but I sit here today very bullish and optimistic about the opportunity here."

For example, here in Santa Monica, to the community here, which 55% of our business community in Santa Monica is now digital. They call Santa Monica the Silicon Beach. So the Bay Area, Southern California, Tysons Corner, places, North Bridge, Chicago, Michigan Avenue, the Boroughs in New York.

That's unencumbered today, and we have very little NOI coming in from there. So that's going to come up. At the end of the day, we're not going to be taking leverage up much at all. Remember, we prefunded the buyback with the $2.3 billion we generated by selling the joint venture interest. So unlike a lot of companies that lever up to do the buyback, we already raised the capital ahead of time. In terms of the line, I mentioned a couple of financings. We're pulling a substantial amount of excess proceeds out of the North Bridge financing, for example. We'll do the same in Corte Madera. And in addition, given the great financing market, we will probably put a long-term mortgage on Fresno Fashion Fair, which is currently unencumbered. And that's about $340 million of proceeds that would then be used to pay down the line of credit. So we expect even after a third ASR or however we choose to do it to get the buyback up to the $1.2 billion, that we would have a line that would vary between $500 million and $1 billion, which is comfortable for us given that we can take that line all the way up to $2 billion."

Second quarter reflected continued strong operating results, as evidenced by strength in most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. In addition, we completed our previously-announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also completed some significant financing transactions. We'll talk about all those in greater detail later in the call. 
For the quarter, FFO was $1.02 compared to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Same-center NOI increased by 6.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. This was positively impacted by about $6 million of lease termination revenue in the second quarter of 2016. This timing is somewhat accelerated compared to our guidance, which had most of the 2016 estimated lease termination revenues forecast in the third and fourth quarter. Our estimate for same-center NOI growth for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range. 
The gross operating margin at the center improved at 70.3% in the quarter, up from 69.8% the second quarter of last year. Bad debt expense was a relatively modest $1.7 million for the quarter, down from $2 million a year ago. As I mentioned, lease termination revenues at about $6 million for the quarter. That compared to $2.8 million last year. Year-to-date lease fees are $9.4 million compared to $5.4 million for the first 6 months of last year. And our full your assumption for lease term revenues this year changed at $15 million. And when we make a decision to negotiate lease termination agreement, it's typically a trade-off for making the business decision to take the cash now and incur a higher vacancy loss of future minimum rent and charges until the space is released. 
During second quarter, the average interest rate was 3.52%, up slightly from a year ago, which was 3.47%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics included debt to market cap at about 36% and interest coverage ratio a very strong 3.6x. Our forward debt to EBITDA of 7.2x and average debt maturity of 6.4 years. The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. We've closed -- are committed on 2 live company deals, and we're currently in the market with a large CMBS deal. On May 27, we closed a $375 million financing on North Bridge Mall. There, it was a 12-year fixed-rate loan at 3.68%, and we used a portion of those proceeds to pay off the old loan, which is $188 million, with an interest rate of 7.20%. That was a life company transaction. Another life company deal, which we'll be closing here in the next week or so is The Village at Corte Madera. We're putting a $225 million fixed-rate loan in place, and that's a 12-year deal fixed at 3.50%. Again, some nice financing at historically low levels in terms of the interest rates. 
On July 5, we closed an extension of our $1.5 billion line of credit. That line of credit was set to mature in April of 2018. And including our extension options on the new facility, it goes out to July of 2021 and reduces our borrowing rate to about LIBOR plus 1 33, about a 70 -- 17, excuse me, 17 basis point improvement from our old facility. 
We got some significant financing that will take place in the third and fourth quarter. We should

from Fresno which is currently unencumbered. We're in the market with debt right now. It's going to be a CMBS transaction. Term is expected to be 10 years. We're getting bids now. We're getting some very, very strong quotes. We would expect that to close
[Audio Gap] 
at Corte Madera. And in addition, later this year, Eastland is an unencumbered asset that we will probably finance. And that could be as much as $175 million. So with that -- it would comfortably put our line of credit outstanding balance at $500 million or less. 
We concluded our third $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program on July 11. This was part of a board-authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program that was announced in October. We've used 3 separate investment banks to execute these ASR programs. The summary results were we invested the entire $1.2 billion, the average share price on all 3 combined was $78.62 and the total number of shares repurchased was 15.3 million shares, roughly 9.6% of our shares outstanding. 
This day, on the guidance, again, we reaffirm guidance today of $4.05 to $4.15 for the full year. And just to reiterate, the remaining 2 quarters, we estimate our FFO for the full year, 25% or so will be in the third quarter and 29% of that total in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I will now turn over to Bob to discuss leasing and tenant environment."

Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during t",774,"Thanks, Tom. Leasing activity during the second quarter remained strong, reflecting demand from the retailers for The Macerich portfolio. 
First, let me talk about leasing spreads. Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during the previous quarter. Regionally, East and West Coast properties have produced the highest leasing spreads. Average rent for lease signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.31 per square foot. During the second quarter, a total of 848,000 square feet of leases were signed, up from 733,000 square feet in the previous quarter. The average term signed in the second quarter increased to 6.0 years. 
Occupancy. Leasing levels at the end of the second quarter were 95.0%. This represents a 50 basis points year-over-year decline and a 10 basis point decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we discussed in the last earnings call, the decline in year-over-year occupancy was primarily caused by the movement of Fashion Outlets in Niagara and South Park out of the development portfolio into the stabilized pool. The occupancy also reflects the disposition of Capitola Mall and the acquisition of Country Club Plaza. Temporary occupancy improved at the end of the second quarter, dropping 30 basis points from the previous quarter to 5.2%. 
Sales. Portfolio of sales were $626 per square foot compared to $623 on a year-over-year basis. Same-center sales per square foot were $644 compared to $629 for the year earlier period. This is a 2.4% increase. Sales were strongest in the West Coast centers, and the categories that showed the strongest sales during the second quarter were beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear, leisure and jewelry. 
I want to take a minute and talk about tenant demand. Within our portfolio, tenant interest remained strongest in the higher-productivity centers, the higher growth markets and the coastal locations. This demand allows us to replace underproductive or struggling stores with those retailers looking to expand. Demand is strongest among: one, core brands renewing and expanding existing locations; two, brand extensions from successful retailers; three, foreign-based retailers; and four, online retailers migrating to in-line stores. Within the last category of online retailers, we see many companies building the infrastructure to open brick-and-mortar locations in a traditional store rollout program. Some examples of this include Blue Nile, Amazon, Palatine, Parker and Bonobos. 
We are also focusing on bringing online retailers into the centers by reducing the physical and economic barriers to entry. Examples of this strategy include stores such as Gentlemen, Blink, Beta and WithMe. It is clear the universe of online retailers will expand in our shopping centers. Some will take a traditional approach to store rollouts and others will be nurtured through nontraditional canvassing and deal structures. This represents a growing opportunity within our portfolio. 
Development. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce the redevelopment of an existing Sears store located at Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. This center is 1 of 3 important assets owned by Macerich in the New York boroughs and serves a trade area of approximately 4 million residents. Since Macerich's acquisition in 2012, we have worked to improve Kings Plaza's merchandise mix, anchor lineup, sales productivity, physical appearance, marketing and property operations. Our goal has been to elevate Kings Plaza to the level that we have achieved at Queens Center. The redevelopment of the Sears Building represents a major step in that direction. Sears will be replaced with 6 to 8 large-format retailers and restaurants, all orientated around a dramatic 4-story atrium. The redevelopment will be anchored by new Primark and Zara flagship stores. We expect these retailers to generate a threefold increase in sales and foot traffic compared to the existing Sears spot. Equally as important, they will open the door to new specialty stores who have not historically been ready to locate at the center. From the perspective of Macerich's portfolio, we are able to significantly reduce our rental exposure to Sears while increasing our footprint with both Zara and Primark as well as improving our position in the New York marketplace. Sears will no longer be a top 10 rent payer within our portfolio. The Macerich portfolio is well suited for Primark's entry into the East Coast market. In June, Primark had a successful opening at the fair, which was followed in July with their opening at Freehold Both of these locations repurpose the Sears anchor, and initial reports indicate a significant increase in foot traffic and sales at these centers. Kings Plaza will represent Primark's third location with Macerich. We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number in the coming months. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

As you can see, we had another very strong quarter from an operating viewpoint. More importantly, from my viewpoint, we also are very pleased to have completed our portfolio management and capital allocation strategy through the completion of our share buyback program. You'll remember that we announced that program literally about 9 months ago and not -- unlike certain other folks, we completed the program in very short order. We did exactly what we said we were going to do. We're very happy to have it behind us. We think that it was a great transaction. That gave us the capital to invest into the balance of our portfolio at what we feel is a substantial discount to our NAV. And we're pleased to have it behind us so that the focus going forward can be on the operating fundamentals of the company as well as our very strong redevelopment and development pipeline. 
I want to touch upon a topic that has been -- a justifiable topic in terms of questions that a lot of investors and the analytical community has asked themselves. And that has to do with rent spreads and whether or not in an environment where you have the decelerating sales or sales that are not growing like they used to grow, ""Can you continue to have rent growth in a manner that we've enjoyed -- and our peers have enjoyed over long period of time?"" It's -- like I said, it's a legitimate question, and especially when you look at other property types where it's not usual to have positive rent spreads continue year in and year out. But it really comes back down to just the laws of supply and demand. We are in the real estate business, and supply and demand is the key to everything. Looking backwards, past performance cannot be a guarantee of future results, as they say. But over the past 10 years, we've averaged 17.4% positive rent spreads over the past 40 quarters. We've had high water marks of 28%. Low water marks in 2009 of 7%, give or take. But on average, we've averaged 17%. I will tell you that if our rent spreads come in at 13% or they come in at 21%, I don't get excited about that one way or the other because I know that, fundamentally, when I think about our mark-to-market, that the ability to generate mid-teen type of rent spreads is embedded within our portfolio. 
As you look at our property type, and you look at regional class A malls, and you think about the universe of the supply of that product, the supply of that product is, let's say, that it's 400 or 500 regional malls. And when we think about that product type in terms of supply, we can look to, by analogy, high street retail, which is also a very low supply, high demand sector. And there have been studies that have been done, more studies that have been done in the regional mall class A sector as it relates to high street, that it is a property type that has shown significant, well above-average rent growth over very long periods of time. And that's what we've enjoyed in our portfolio. That's what our peers with Class A malls have enjoyed in their portfolios. History has been our -- has supported that view, and the fundamentals that we're sitting on support our optimism for this to go forward. 
When we think about the demand side of the transaction in terms of tenant demand for space, a lot of folks tend to focus on the 1 or 2 names that have gone bankrupt recently -- or the 1 or 2 names that people are worried about going bankrupt. But they tend not to focus on the 30 or 40 or 50 names of retailers that have got brand extensions or are just growing their portfolio or now with the recent events with Brexit, we have tenants that have got global expansion plans that are upping their expansion conversations about expansion in the U.S., which is creating incremental demand. When you think about other factors that may or may not influence our demand, and people worry at times about department stores. And we've had more than one of our department stores who said the problem with their sales is mall traffic. Mr. Lex Wexner may -- had a great quote on this point, and I'll probably butcher it. But basically, he said ""The trouble with department stores is not mall traffic. The trouble with mall traffic is the department stores."" What is basically saying that the department stores are not pulling their weight. You take a look at the parking lots at more than one of our department stores and some of our malls, and they're not as busy as the other parking lots. This creates opportunity. We and our other Class A mall peers have had great history of replacing our department stores that have become unproductive over time with better uses. And we see this as a great opportunity going forward. that we think the Kings Plaza re-merchandising opportunities is going to be dramatic in terms of what that's going to do for mall traffic. 
People worry when they think about rent spreads, about whether or not e-commerce is going to drain sales away from the malls and to reduce the demand for space in the malls. In fact, the advent of digital commerce creates new sources of demand for us in that it creates new tenants that are born digitally and then want to migrate to brick-and-mortar locations. And we are seeing this throughout our portfolio. 
And finally, the thing that probably creates the most anxiety about mall spreads, rent spreads, is when people see sales flat for a certain period of time. And then that causes them anxiety. And that's a legitimate for that anxiety. But what I would point to is this, that if you have a fundamentally very strong portfolio, and you have no new supply being created, and you have demand increasing, then you're going to be able to lease that portfolio. And you're going to be able to lease it at strong rate. We took a look at a couple of years ago, and we dissected sales within our centers. And we said, ""If we take the top 2/3 in each tenant category, what are those tenants doing in terms of sales productivity? And what are the bottom 1/3 of the tenants in our portfolio doing in terms of sales productivity?"" Because that's generally the way we think about things. We tend to think about constantly the bottom 20, the 30% of the producers at our malls as being merchandisers that we're going to want to recapture over a period of time and to replace with names that are more reflective of the merchants that people want to do business with today. 
Here are some numbers. In our top 30 centers, our average sales per square foot are $726 a square foot. That doesn't really tell the story. Within each apparel -- within each tenant category, whether it be apparel, shoes, jewelry, general, the top 2/3 within each category in these centers did $1,028 a square foot. And they comprised about 60% of the GLA in those centers. The bottom 1/3 of the retailers in each of their respective categories in those centers averaged about $313 a square foot. So it's really a tale of 2 cities here. You got the great producers, and then you got the folks that are lagging. You've got 2/3 of your tenants within our top 30 properties are averaging of over $1,000 a foot, 1/3 of our tenants by category are averaging $300 a square foot. So our job is simply to weed out the people that are unprotected and replace them with the tenants that are more reflective of the top 2/3. And when we look at this -- the cost of occupancies within our portfolio, you can't just look at the homogenized number. Our average cost of occupancy in these 30 centers is 13.5%. So you can debate all day about, ""Can you push that number?"" But the reality is our top 2/3 of the tenant in that -- in those top 30 centers, they do over $1,000 a foot and their occupancy cost is under 11%. So when those tenants -- when their leases expire, we -- they're sitting on substantial rent growth from the time that they signed their lease, and they can easily afford to pay rent that would generate in some 15% [ph] or so rent spreads for us. And then when we think about pruning out the bottom part of our portfolio, we're seeking tenants that are going to produce sales that are going to be closer to the top performers. And even if you only got 10% or 11% of sales from tenants that are doing, on average, $1,000 a foot, our top producers in our portfolio, you're going to generate substantial increases. That's why we have the confidence that these rent spreads are sustainable. We have history as our guide.

So in your view, to drive -- as you look at redevelopment and continue to drive mall productivity, which is more important to you? Getting back department store boxes? Or getting out those that -- or replacing the tenants who are averaging $313 a foot?"

Sometimes, you don't necessarily have the ability to recycle an anchor as quickly as you'd like to, so there are things -- generally small space is going to be more accessible to you than department store space. But look, it's what we do every day. It's what we do for a living. I mean we got one department that does nothing but the small shop spaces and another group that does nothing but the anchor stuff. And it's what we do, and they're equally important. They're both really important. And kind of what's left, which I think is left a little bit unsaid, is that as the department stores intentionally reduce in numbers in terms of conventional department stores in the United States, then that's not necessarily a bad thing. It really gives us an opportunity to bring in other traffic generators, whatever those might be. But it also really creates more demand for in-line space. Because as the number of department store locations reduce, then that reduces the distribution points that manufacturers and creative folks have to distribute their merchandise. And so they become interested in in-line stores as a consequence. Take a look at an outlet mall. Outlet malls that we have at FOC and FON, we've got over 400,000 feet of small shop space in these malls. And they're fully occupied that's because the manufacturers are not competing with the department stores as distribution points for them. So this goes -- if this hand plays out over time, U.S. malls will begin to look more like the malls around the world. You go to Canada, for example. You've got 1, 1.5 department stores, maybe 2, in most of those big malls in Canada. And the small shop space could be easily 600,000, 700,000, 800,000 square feet. And I think the reason small shop space there is fully occupied and fairly productive is that they -- it's the best distribution point for the manufacturers of the merchandise. So look, it's an evolutionary process, but we see that if you have must-have real estate, you're always going to have a good idea for it so long as you obviously are in touch with the pulse of the market, which we are."

I think it is important to note that we believe we're being very conservative in the way that we are reporting this return to you. I'm aware of other owners of malls that when they bring in a replacement department store, sometimes they include what they think is going to be the uplift in market rents for the entire mall into the return they expect to get from that department store. And I'm not saying that in a critical way. I'm saying that because I'm just aware there are different ways of thinking about what your return is when you replace a department store. We're not doing that in this situation. And we're looking at it, comparing it to the very substantial ramp at Sears would have been paying over the next couple of years. Now Sears, they're lease expired anyway in a couple of years. So you could argue that the 8% return is really the more realistic return, but we wanted to -- look, we know that a lot of you are trying to do models based upon this information and that is important as the return that we're reporting. So we wanted to help you with the model. And it's really 4% over what we're getting right now. As we think about it, we -- look, we do think about it long term. And we think about any investment in a replacement of the department store or any investment of that size in terms of IRRs over expected holding period also. And the actual IRR on that particular investment, and this is just again going over the current rent at Sears [indiscernible] approaches 10%.

But remember, I think one of my peers indicated to you in a call a few quarters ago, I think he was observing that top 10 tenants, when he went public 20-some years ago, that only 2 or 3 of them are still in business. Well, does that mean that the business went bad? Or does that mean that we had 8 great new top 10 tenants? And frankly, the answer is, we got 8 really good new guys. And the 8 guys that went away, they went away because they had matured. And I feel -- look, it all comes back to supply and demand. And we can dissect this to the nth degree. But the way that we look at things is that we think about not what is, but what can be. So we don't think about a space where tenants doing $300 a foot and say that's a $300 space, we look at it and say it's potentially that's a $300 space because it's a crappy tenant.

And by the way, it's not just us. It's our peers do that also. Now, I will tell you that we are able to do that because we have 10 -- we have properties that are must-have properties. If we had commodity type of properties or we were relocated in some really secondary or tertiary markets are we -- we're dealing with a portfolio of significantly lower-quality properties, we won't be in a position to have this conversation.

Second quarter reflected continued strong operating results, as evidenced by strength in most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. In addition, we completed our previously-announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also completed some significant financing transactions. We'll talk about all those in greater detail later in the call. 
For the quarter, FFO was $1.02 compared to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Same-center NOI increased by 6.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. This was positively impacted by about $6 million of lease termination revenue in the second quarter of 2016. This timing is somewhat accelerated compared to our guidance, which had most of the 2016 estimated lease termination revenues forecast in the third and fourth quarter. Our estimate for same-center NOI growth for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range. 
The gross operating margin at the center improved to 70.3% in the quarter, up from 69.8% in the second quarter of last year. Bad debt expense was a relatively modest $1.7 million for the quarter, down from $2 million a year ago. As I mentioned, lease termination revenues at about $6 million for the quarter, that compared to $2.8 million last year. Year-to-date lease term fees are $9.4 million compared to $5.4 million for the first 6 months of last year. And our full your assumption for lease term revenue this year changed at $15 million. And when we make a decision and negotiate lease termination agreement, it's typically a trade-off for making the business decision to take the cash now and incur a higher vacancy loss of future minimum rent and charges until the space is released. 
During second quarter, the average interest rate was 3.52%, up slightly from a year ago, which was 3.47%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics included debt to market cap at about 36% and interest coverage ratio a very strong 3.6x, our forward debt to EBITDA of 7.2x and a average debt maturity of 6.4 years. The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. We have closed or committed on 2 life company deals, and we're currently in the market with a large CMBS deal. On May 27, we closed a $375 million financing on North Bridge Mall. There was a 12-year fixed-rate loan at 3.68%, and we used a portion of those proceeds to pay off the old loan, which is $188 million, with an interest rate of 7.20%. That was a life company transaction. Another life company deal, which we'll be closing here in the next week or so is in The Village at Corte Madera. We're putting a $225 million fixed-rate loan in place, and that's a 12-year deal fixed at 3.50%. Again, some nice financing at historically low levels in terms of the interest rates. 
On July 5, we closed on an extension of our $1.5 billion line of credit. That line of credit was set to mature in April of 2018. And including our extension options on the new facility, it goes out to July of 2021 and reduces our borrowing rate to about LIBOR plus 1.33%, about a 70 -- 17, excuse me, 17 basis point improvement from our old facility. All right. Quarter end, that's -- the balance on their facility was about $1 billion. However, we've got some significant financings that will take place in the third and fourth quarter. We should 
generate $350 million of excess process from Fresno, which is currently unencumbered. We're in the market with that right now. It's going to be a CMBS transaction. Term is expected to be 10 years. We're getting bids now. We're getting some very, very strong quotes. We would expect that to close in September. In addition, we'll have about $75 million of excess proceeds from the closing of at Corte Madera. And in addition, later this year, Eastland is an unencumbered asset that we will probably finance and that could be as much as $175 million. So with that, it would comfortably put our line of credit outstanding balance at $500 million or less. 
We concluded our third $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program on July 11. This was part of a board-authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program that was announced in October. We've used 3 separate investment banks to execute these ASR programs. And the summary results where we invested the entire $1.2 billion, the average share price on all 3 combined was $78.62 and the total number of shares repurchased was 15.3 million shares, roughly 9.6% of our shares outstanding. 
This day, on the guidance, again, we reaffirm guidance today of $4.05 to $4.15 for the full year. And just to reiterate, the remaining 2 quarters, we estimate of that FFO for the full year, 25% or so will be in the third quarter and 29% of that total in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Bob to discuss leasing and tenant environment."

Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during t",779,"Thanks, Tom. Leasing activity during the second quarter remained strong, reflecting demand from the retailers for The Macerich portfolio. 
First, let me talk about leasing spreads. Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during the previous quarter. Regionally, East and West Coast properties have produced the highest leasing spreads. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.31 per square foot. During the second quarter, a total of 848,000 square feet of leases were signed, up from 733,000 square feet in the previous quarter. The average term signed in the second quarter increased to 6.0 years. 
Occupancy. Leasing levels at the end of the second quarter were 95.0%. This represents a 50 basis points year-over-year decline and a 10 basis point decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we discussed in the last earnings call, the decline in year-over-year occupancy was primarily caused by the movement of Fashion Outlets of Niagara and South Park out of the development portfolio into the stabilized pool. The occupancy also reflects the disposition of Capitola Mall and the acquisition of Country Club Plaza. Temporary occupancy improved at the end of the second quarter, dropping 30 basis points from the previous quarter to 5.2%. 
Sales. Portfolio of sales were $626 per square foot compared to $623 on a year-over-year basis. Same-center sales per square foot were $644 compared to $629 for the year earlier period. This is a 2.4% increase. Sales were strongest in the West Coast centers, and the categories that showed the strongest sales during the second quarter were beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear, leisure and jewelry. 
I want to take a minute and talk about tenant demand. Within our portfolio, tenant interest remained strongest in the higher-productivity centers, the higher growth markets and the coastal locations. This demand allows us to replace underproductive or struggling stores with those retailers looking to expand. Demand is strongest among: one, core brands renewing and expanding existing locations; two, brand extensions from successful retailers; three, foreign-based retailers; and four, online retailers migrating to in-line stores. Within the last category of online retailers, we see many companies building the infrastructure to open brick-and-mortar locations in a traditional store rollout program. Some examples of this include Blue Nile, Amazon, Palatine, [ph] Bobby Parker and Bonobos. 
We are also focusing on bringing online retailers into the centers by reducing the physical and economic barriers to entry. Examples of this strategy include stores such as Combatant Gentlemen, Blink, Beta and WithMe. It is clear the universe of online retailers will expand in our shopping centers. Some will take a traditional approach to store rollouts and others will be nurtured through nontraditional canvassing and deal structures. This represents a growing opportunity within our portfolio. 
Development. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce the redevelopment of an existing Sears store located at Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. This center is 1 of 3 important assets owned by Macerich in the New York boroughs and serves a trade area of approximately 4 million residents. Since Macerich's acquisition in 2012, we have worked to improve Kings Plaza's merchandise mix, anchor lineup, sales productivity, physical appearance, marketing and property operations. Our goal has been to elevate Kings Plaza to the level that we have achieved at Queens Center. The redevelopment of the Sears building represents a major step in that direction. Sears will be replaced with 6 to 8 large-format retailers and restaurants, all orientated at around a dramatic 4-storey atrium. The redevelopment will be anchored by new Primark and Zara flagship stores. We expect these retailers to generate a threefold increase in sales and foot traffic compared to the existing Sears spot. Equally as important, they will open the door to new specialty stores, who have not historically been ready to locate at the center. From the perspective of Macerich's portfolio, we are able to significantly reduce our rental exposure to Sears while increasing our footprint with both Zara and Primark as well as improving our position in the New York marketplace. Sears will no longer be a top 10 rent payer within our portfolio. The Macerich portfolio is well suited for Primark's entry into the East Coast markets. In June, Primark had a successful opening at Danbury fair, which was followed in July with their opening at Freehold Raceway. Both of these locations repurpose the Sears anchor, and initial reports indicate a significant increase in foot traffic and sales at these centers. Kings Plaza will represent Primark's third location with Macerich. We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number in the coming months. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

As you can see, we had another very strong quarter from an operating viewpoint. More importantly, from my viewpoint, we also are very pleased to have completed our portfolio management and capital allocation strategy through the completion of our share buyback program. You'll remember that we announced that program literally about 9 months ago and not -- and unlike certain other folks, we completed the program in very short order. We did exactly what we said we were going to do. We're very happy to have it behind us. We think that it was a great transaction, that gave us the capital to invest into the balance of our portfolio at what we feel is a substantial discount to our NAV. And we're pleased to have it behind us so that the focus going forward can be on the operating fundamentals of the company as well as our very strong redevelopment and development pipeline. 
I want to touch upon a topic that has been -- a justifiable topic in terms of questions that a lot of investors and the analytical community has asked themselves. And that has to do with rent spreads and whether or not in an environment where you have decelerating sales or sales that are not growing like they used to grow, ""Can you continue to have rent growth in a manner that we've enjoyed and our peers have enjoyed over a long period of time?"" It's -- like I said, it's a legitimate question, and especially when you look at other property types where it's not usual to have positive rent spreads continue year in and year out. But it really comes back down to just the laws of supply and demand. We are in the real estate business, and supply and demand is the key to everything. Looking backwards, past performance cannot be a guarantee of future results, as they say. But over the past 10 years, we've averaged 17.4% positive rent spreads over the past 40 quarters. We've had high water marks of 28%. Low water marks in 2009 of 7%, give or take. But on average, we've averaged 17%. I will tell you that if our rent spreads come in at 13% or they come in at 21%, I don't get excited about that one way or the other because I know that, fundamentally, when I think about our mark-to-market, that the ability to generate mid-teen type of rent spreads is embedded within our portfolio. 
As you look at our property type, and you look at regional class A malls, and you think about the universe of the supply of that product, the supply of that product is, let's say, that it's 400 or 500 regional malls. And when we think about that, that product type in terms of supply, we can look to, by analogy, high street retail, which is also a very low supply, high demand sector. And there have been studies that have been done, more studies that have been done in the regional mall class A sector as it relates to high street, that it is a property type that has shown significant, well above-average rent growth over very long periods of time. And that's what we've enjoyed in our portfolio. That's what our peers with Class A malls have enjoyed in their portfolios. History has been our -- has supported that view, and the fundamentals that we're sitting on support our optimism for this to go forward. 
When we think about the demand side of the transaction in terms of tenant demand for space, a lot of folks tend to focus on the 1 or 2 names that have gone bankrupt recently -- or the 1 or 2 names that people are worried about going bankrupt. But they tend not to focus on the 30 or 40 or 50 names of retailers that have got brand extensions or are just growing their portfolio or now with the recent events with Brexit, we have tenants that have got global expansion plans that are upping their expansion conversations about their expansion in the U.S., which is creating incremental demand. You think about other factors that may or may not influence our demand, and people worry at times about department stores. And we've had more than one of our department stores who said the problem with their sales is mall traffic. Mr. Lex Wexner may -- had a great quote on this point, and I'll probably butcher it. But basically, he said ""The trouble with department stores is not mall traffic. The trouble with mall traffic is the department stores."" What he is basically saying is that the department stores are not pulling their weight. You take a look at the parking lots of more than one of our department stores and some of our malls, and they're not as busy as the other parking lots. This creates opportunity. We and our other Class A mall peers have had great history of replacing our department stores that have become unproductive over time with better uses. And we see this as a great opportunity going forward anecdotally we think that the Kings Plaza re-merchandising opportunity is going to be dramatic in terms of what that's going to do for mall traffic. 
People worry when they think about rent spreads, about whether or not e-commerce is going to drain sales away from the malls and to reduce the demand for space in the malls. In fact, the advent of digital commerce creates new sources of demand for us in that it creates new tenants that are born digitally and then want to migrate to brick-and-mortar locations. And we are seeing this throughout our portfolio. 
And finally, the thing that probably creates the most anxiety about mall spreads, rent spreads, is when people see sales flat for a certain period of time. And then that causes them anxiety. And that's legitimate for that anxiety. But what I would point to you is this, that if you have a fundamentally very strong portfolio, and you have no new supply being created, and you have demand increasing, then you're going to be able to lease that portfolio and you're going to be able to lease it at strong rents. We took a look at a couple of years ago, and we dissected sales within our centers. And we said, ""If we take the top 2/3 in each tenant category, what are those tenants doing in terms of sales productivity? And what are the bottom 1/3 of the tenants in our portfolio doing in terms of sales productivity?"" Because that's generally the way we think about things. We tend to think about constantly the bottom 20, the 30% of the producers in our malls as being merchandisers that we're going to want to recapture over a period of time and to replace with names that are more reflective of the merchants that people want to do business with today. 
Here are some numbers. In our top 30 centers, our average sales per square foot are $726 a square foot. That doesn't really tell the story. Within each apparel -- within each tenant category, whether it'd be apparel, shoes, jewelry, general, the top 2/3 within each category in these centers did $1,028 a square foot. And they comprised about 60% of the GLA in those centers. The bottom 1/3 of the retailers in each of the respective categories in those centers averaged about $313 a square foot. So it's really a tale of 2 cities here. You got the great producers, and then you got the folks that are lagging. You've got 2/3 of your tenants within our top 30 properties are averaging over $1,000 a foot, 1/3 of our tenants by category are averaging $300 a square foot. So our job is simply to weed out the people that are unprotected and then replace them with the tenants that are more reflective of the top 2/3. And when we look at this -- the cost of occupancies within our portfolio, you can't just look at the homogenized number. Our average cost of occupancy in these 30 centers is 13.5%. So you can debate all day about, ""Oh, can you push that number?"" But the reality is, that our top 2/3 of the tenants in that -- in those top 30 centers, they do over $1,000 a foot and their occupancy cost is under 11%. So when those tenants -- when their leases expire, we -- they're sitting on substantial rent growth from the time that they signed their lease, and they can easily afford to pay rents that would generate in some 15% or so rent spreads for us. And then when we think about pruning out the bottom part of our portfolio, we're seeking tenants that are going to produce sales that are going to be closer to the top performers. And even if you've only got 10% or 11% of sales from tenants that are doing, on average, $1,000 a foot, our top producers in our portfolio, you're going to generate substantial increases. That's why we have the confidence that these rent spreads are sustainable. We have history as our guide and obviously, it doesn't guarantee future performance, but it is something that we are actually comfortable that these -- that, that rent spreads will continue to be a big driver of our same-center NOI growth going forward. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

And kind of what's left, which I think is left a little bit unsaid, is that as the department stores potentially reduce their numbers in terms of conventional department stores in the United States, then that's not necessarily a bad thing. It really gives us an opportunity to bring in other traffic generators, whatever those might be. But it also really creates more demand for in-line space. Because as the number of department store locations reduce, then that reduces the distribution points that manufacturers and creative folks have to distribute their merchandise. And so they become interested in in-line stores as a consequence. Take a look at an outlet mall. Outlet malls that we have at FOC and FON, we've got over 400,000 feet of small shop space in these malls. And they're fully occupied and that's because the manufacturers are not competing with the department stores as distribution points for them. So as this goes -- if this hand plays out over time, U.S. malls will begin to look more like the malls around the world. You go to Canada, for example. You've got 1, 1.5 department stores, maybe 2, in most of those big malls in Canada. And the small shop space could be easily 600,000, 700,000, 800,000 square feet. And I think the reason the small shop space there is fully occupied and fairly productive is that they -- it's the best distribution point for the manufacturers of the merchandise. So look, it's an evolutionary process, but we see that if you have must-have real estate, you're always going to have a good idea for it so long as you obviously are in touch with the pulse of the market, which we are."

We've been able to maintain those. But now, most of what we see is coming from revenue growth and you may have noticed other income was a little bit higher this quarter. And part of that was driven by Country Club Plaza being in for the quarter, but part of it was from the hotel being open at Tysons, but we also had additional parking revenues and revenues that we're generating from our common areas. So that's been a big emphasis this year on generating more revenue from our common area, could be advertising, could be sponsorship income. It's basically not a real estate revenue. And that has been an emphasis, and that's going to help us to continue to move that gross margin up."

It was a placeholder before, that's why we put it into the shadow pipeline. But it's evolving. These are the numbers that we see today. I think it is important to note that we believe we're being very conservative in the way that we are reporting this return to you. I'm aware of other owners of malls that when they bring in a replacement department store, sometimes they include what they think is going to be the uplift in market rents for the entire mall into the return they expect to get from that department store. And I'm not saying that in a critical way, I'm saying that because I'm just aware there are different ways of thinking about what your return is when you replace a department store. We're not doing in this situation. And we're looking at it, comparing it to the very substantial ramp that Sears would have been paying over the next couple of years. Now Sears, they're lease expired anyway in a couple of years. So you could argue that the 8% return is really the more realistic return, but we wanted to -- look, we know that a lot of you are trying to do models based upon this information and that is important as the return that we're reporting. And so we wanted to help you with the model. And it's really 4% over what we're getting right now. So as we think about it, we -- look, we do think about it long term. And we think about any investment in a replacement of the department store or any investment of that size in terms of IRRs over an expected holding period also. And the actual IRR on that particular investment, and this is just again going over the current rents that Sears is paying approaches 10%. So the company and the board felt very comfortable going forward to -- go ahead, Bob."

It's the nature of the business. But if you remember, I think one of my peers indicated to you in a call a few quarters ago, I think he was observing that because top 10 tenants, when we went public 20-some years ago, there's only 2 or 3 of them are still in business. Well, does that mean that the business went bad? Or does that mean that we had 8 great new top 10 tenants? And frankly, the answer is, we got 8 really good new guys. And the 8 guys that went away, they went away because they had matured. And I feel -- look, it all comes back to supply and demand. And we can dissect this to the nth degree. But the way that we look at things is that we think about not what is, but what can be. So we don't think about a space where tenants doing $300 a foot and say that's a $300 space, we look at it and say it's potentially that's a $300 space because it's a crappy tenant. We had a tenant at Santa Monica Place on the second level that I think was doing $300 a foot, Bobby, a 10,000-foot tenant at a [ph] payroll center. And we didn't say, ""Oh, that's a $300-foot location, and we replaced them with a really good new tenant who is doing probably 3x that, which -- that's what we do every day. And by the way, it's not just us, it's our peers do that also. Now, I will tell you that we're able to do that because we have 10 -- we have properties that are must-have properties. If we had commodity type of properties or we were relocated in some really secondary or tertiary markets or we're dealing with a portfolio of significantly lower-quality properties, we won't be in a position to have this conversation. But we are in high-demand locations with great real estate, somewhat similar to high street retail and the demand characteristics and returns and rent growth that those have enjoyed over the years. It's supply and demand. It all comes down to that."

This was positively impacted by about $6 million of lease termination revenue in the second quarter of 2016. This timing is somewhat accelerated compared to our guidance, which had most of the 2016 estimated lease termination revenues forecast in the third and fourth quarter. Our estimate for same-center NOI growth for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range. 
The gross operating margin at the center improved to 70.3% in the quarter, up from 69.8% in the second quarter of last year. Bad debt expense was a relatively modest $1.7 million for the quarter, down from $2 million a year ago. As I mentioned, lease termination revenues at about $6 million for the quarter, that compared to $2.8 million last year. Year-to-date lease term fees are $9.4 million compared to $5.4 million for the first 6 months of last year. And our full year assumption for lease term revenue this year changed at $15 million. And when we make the decision and negotiate a lease termination agreement, it's typically a trade-off for making the business decision to take the cash now and incur the higher vacancy, loss of future minimum rent and charges until the space is re-leased. 
During second quarter, the average interest rate was 3.52%, up slightly from a year ago, which was 3.47%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics included debt to market cap at about 36% and interest coverage ratio a very strong 3.6x, a forward debt to EBITDA of 7.2x and a average debt maturity of 6.4 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. We have closed or committed on 2 life company deals, and we're currently in the market with a large CMBS deal. On May 27, we closed a $375 million financing on North Bridge Mall. There was a 12-year fixed-rate loan at 3.68%, and we used a portion of those proceeds to pay off the old loan, which was $188 million, with an interest rate of 7.20%. That was a life company transaction. Another life company deal, which we'll be closing here in the next week or so is at The Village at Corte Madera. We're putting a $225 million fixed-rate loan in place, and that's a 12-year deal fixed at 3.50%. Again, some nice financing at historically low levels in terms of the interest rates. 
On July 5, we closed on an extension of our $1.5 billion line of credit. That line of credit was set to mature in April of 2018. And including our extension options on the new facility, it goes out to July of 2021 and reduces our borrowing rate to about LIBOR plus 1.33%, about a 70 -- 17, excuse me, 17 basis point improvement from our old facility. All right. Quarter end, that's -- the balance on their facility was about $1 billion. However, we've got some significant financings that will take place in the third and fourth quarter. We should 
generate $350 million of excess proceeds from Fresno, which is currently unencumbered. We're in the market with that right now. It's going to be a CMBS transaction. Term is expected to be 10 years. We're getting bids now. We're getting some very, very strong quotes. We would expect that to close in September. In addition, we'll have about $75 million of excess proceeds from the closing of Corte Madera. And in addition, later this year, Eastland is an unencumbered asset that we will probably finance and that could be as much as $175 million. So with that, it would comfortably put our line of credit outstanding balance at $500 million or less. 
We concluded our third $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program on July 11. This was part of a board-authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program that was announced in October. We've used 3 separate investment banks to execute these ASR programs. The summary results were: we invested the entire $1.2 billion; the average share price on all 3 combined was $78.62; and the total number of shares repurchased was 15.3 million shares, roughly 9.6% of our shares outstanding. 
This day, on the guidance, again, we reaffirm guidance today of $4.05 to $4.15 for the full year. And just to reiterate, the remaining 2 quarters, we estimate of that FFO for the full year, 25% or so will be in the third quarter and 29% of that total in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Bob to discuss leasing and tenant environment."

Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during t",779,"Thanks, Tom. Leasing activity during the second quarter remained strong, reflecting demand from the retailers for The Macerich portfolio. 
First, let me talk about leasing spreads. Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during the previous quarter. Regionally, East and West Coast properties have produced the highest leasing spreads. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.31 per square foot. During the second quarter, a total of 848,000 square feet of leases were signed, up from 733,000 square feet in the previous quarter. The average term signed in the second quarter increased to 6.0 years. 
Occupancy. Leasing levels at the end of the second quarter were 95.0%. This represents a 50 basis points year-over-year decline and a 10 basis point decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we discussed in the last earnings call, the decline in year-over-year occupancy was primarily caused by the movement of Fashion Outlets of Niagara and SouthPark out of the development portfolio into the stabilized pool. The occupancy also reflects the disposition of Capitola Mall and the acquisition of Country Club Plaza. Temporary occupancy improved at the end of the second quarter, dropping 30 basis points from the previous quarter to 5.2%. 
Sales. Portfolio of sales were $626 per square foot compared to $623 on a year-over-year basis. Same-center sales per square foot were $644 compared to $629 for the year earlier period. This is a 2.4% increase. Sales were strongest in the West Coast centers, and the categories that showed the strongest sales during the second quarter were beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear, athleisure and jewelry. 
I want to take a minute and talk about tenant demand. Within our portfolio, tenant interest remained strongest in the higher-productivity centers, the higher growth markets and the coastal locations. This demand allows us to replace underproductive or struggling stores with those retailers looking to expand. Demand is strongest among: one, core brands renewing and expanding existing locations; two, brand extensions from successful retailers; three, foreign-based retailers; and four, online retailers migrating to in-line stores. Within the last category of online retailers, we see many companies building the infrastructure to open brick-and-mortar locations in a traditional store rollout program. Some examples of this include Blue Nile, Amazon, Peloton, Warby Parker and Bonobos. 
We are also focusing on bringing online retailers into the centers by reducing the physical and economic barriers to entry. Examples of this strategy include stores such as Combatant Gentlemen, Blink [ph], Beta [ph] and WithMe. It is clear the universe of online retailers will expand in our shopping centers. Some will take a traditional approach to store rollouts and others will be nurtured through nontraditional canvassing and deal structures. This represents a growing opportunity within our portfolio. 
Development. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce the redevelopment of an existing Sears store located at Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. This center is 1 of 3 important assets owned by Macerich in the New York boroughs and serves a trade area of approximately 4 million residents. Since Macerich's acquisition in 2012, we have worked to improve Kings Plaza's merchandise mix, anchor lineup, sales productivity, physical appearance, marketing and property operations. Our goal has been to elevate Kings Plaza to the level that we have achieved at Queens Center. The redevelopment of the Sears building represents a major step in that direction. Sears will be replaced with 6 to 8 large-format retailers and restaurants, all orientated at around a dramatic 4-story atrium. The redevelopment will be anchored by new Primark and Zara flagship stores. We expect these retailers to generate a threefold increase in sales and foot traffic compared to the existing Sears spot. Equally as important, they will open the door to new specialty stores, who have not historically been ready to locate at the center. From the perspective of Macerich's portfolio, we are able to significantly reduce our rental exposure to Sears while increasing our footprint with both Zara and Primark as well as improving our position in the New York marketplace. Sears will no longer be a top 10 rent payer within our portfolio. The Macerich portfolio is well suited for Primark's entry into the East Coast markets. In June, Primark had a successful opening at Danbury Fair, which was followed in July with their opening at Freehold Raceway. Both of these locations repurpose the Sears anchor, and initial reports indicate a significant increase in foot traffic and sales at these centers. Kings Plaza will represent Primark's third location with Macerich. We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number in the coming months. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

As you can see, we had another very strong quarter from an operating viewpoint. More importantly, from my viewpoint, we also are very pleased to have completed our portfolio management and capital allocation strategy through the completion of our share buyback program. You'll remember that we announced that program literally about 9 months ago and not -- unlike certain other folks, we completed the program in very short order. We did exactly what we said we were going to do. We're very happy to have it behind us. We think that it was a great transaction, that gave us the capital to invest into the balance of our portfolio at what we feel is a substantial discount to our NAV. And we're pleased to have it behind us so that the focus going forward can be on the operating fundamentals of the company as well as our very strong redevelopment and development pipeline. 
I want to touch upon a topic that has been -- a justifiable topic in terms of questions that a lot of investors and the analytical community has asked themselves. And that has to do with rent spreads and whether or not in an environment where you have decelerating sales or sales that are not growing like they used to grow, ""Can you continue to have rent growth in the manner that we've enjoyed and our peers have enjoyed over a long period of time?"" It's -- like I said, it's a legitimate question, and especially when you look at other property types where it's not usual to have positive rent spreads continue year in and year out. But it really comes back down to just the laws of supply and demand. We are in the real estate business, and supply and demand is the key to everything. Looking backwards, past performance cannot be a guarantee of future results, as they say. But over the past 10 years, we've averaged 17.4% positive rent spreads over the past 40 quarters. We've had high water marks of 28%. Low water marks in 2009 of 7%, give or take. But on average, we've averaged 17%. I will tell you that if our rent spreads come in at 13% or they come in at 21%, I don't get excited about that one way or the other because I know that, fundamentally, when I think about our mark-to-market, that the ability to generate mid-teen type of rent spreads is embedded within our portfolio. 
As you look at our property type, and you look at regional class A malls, and you think about the universe of the supply of that product, the supply of that product is, let's say, that it's 400 or 500 regional malls. And when we think about that, that product type in terms of supply, we can look to, by analogy, high street retail, which is also a very low supply, high demand sector. And there have been studies that have been done, more studies that have been done in the regional mall class A sector as it relates to high street, that it is a property type that has shown significant, well above-average rent growth over very long periods of time. And that's what we've enjoyed in our portfolio. That's what our peers with Class A malls have enjoyed in their portfolios. History has been our -- has supported that view, and the fundamentals that we're sitting on support our optimism for this to go forward. 
When we think about the demand side of the transaction in terms of tenant demand for space, a lot of folks tend to focus on the 1 or 2 names that have gone bankrupt recently -- or the 1 or 2 names that people are worried about going bankrupt. But they tend not to focus on the 30 or 40 or 50 names of retailers that have got brand extensions or are just growing their portfolio or now with the recent events with Brexit, we have tenants that have got global expansion plans that are upping their expansion conversations about their expansion in the U.S., which is creating incremental demand. You think about other factors that may or may not influence our demand, and people worry at times about department stores. And we've had more than one of our department stores who said the problem with their sales is mall traffic. Mr. Les Wexner made -- had a great quote on this point, and I'll probably butcher it. But basically, he said ""The trouble with department stores is not mall traffic. The trouble with mall traffic is the department stores."" What he is basically saying is that the department stores are not pulling their weight. You take a look at the parking lots of more than one of our department stores and in some of our malls, and they're not as busy as the other parking lots. This creates opportunity. We and our other Class A mall peers have had great history of replacing our department stores that have become unproductive over time with better uses. And we see this as a great opportunity going forward. Anecdotally, we think that the Kings Plaza re-merchandising opportunity is going to be dramatic in terms of what that's going to do for mall traffic. 
People worry when they think about rent spreads, about whether or not e-commerce is going to drain sales away from the malls and to reduce the demand for space in the malls. In fact, the advent of digital commerce creates new sources of demand for us in that it creates new tenants that are born digitally and then want to migrate to brick-and-mortar locations. And we are seeing this throughout our portfolio. 
And finally, the thing that probably creates the most anxiety about mall spreads, rent spreads, is when people see sales flat for a certain period of time. And then that causes them anxiety. And that's legitimate for that anxiety. But what I would point to you is this, that if you have a fundamentally very strong portfolio, and you have no new supply being created, and you have demand increasing, then you're going to be able to lease that portfolio and you're going to be able to lease it at strong rents. We took a look a couple of years ago, and we dissected sales within our centers. And we said, ""If we take the top 2/3 in each tenant category, what are those tenants doing in terms of sales productivity? And what are the bottom 1/3 of the tenants in our portfolio doing in terms of sales productivity?"" Because that's generally the way we think about things. We tend to think about constantly the bottom 20, the 30% of the producers in our malls as being merchandisers that we're going to want to recapture over a period of time and to replace with names that are more reflective of the merchants that people want to do business with today. 
Here are some numbers. In our top 30 centers, our average sales per square foot are $726 a square foot. That doesn't really tell the story. Within each apparel -- within each tenant category, whether it'd be apparel, shoes, jewelry, general, the top 2/3 within each category in these centers did $1,028 a square foot. And they comprised about 60% of the GLA in those centers. The bottom 1/3 of the retailers in each of the respective categories in those centers averaged about $313 a square foot. So it's really a tale of 2 cities here. You got the great producers, and then you got the folks that are lagging. You've got 2/3 of your tenants within our top 30 properties are averaging over $1,000 a foot, 1/3 of our tenants by category are averaging $300 a square foot. So our job is simply to weed out the people that are unproductive and to replace them with the tenants that are more reflective of the top 2/3. And when we look at this -- the cost of occupancies within our portfolio, you can't just look at the homogenized number. Our average cost of occupancy in these 30 centers is 13.5%. So you can debate all day about, ""Oh, can you push that number?"" But the reality is, that our top 2/3 of the tenants in that -- in those top 30 centers, they do over $1,000 a foot and their occupancy cost is under 11%. So when those tenants -- when their leases expire, we -- they're sitting on substantial rent growth from the time that they signed their lease, and they can easily afford to pay rents that would generate in some 15% or so rent spreads for us. And then when we think about pruning out the bottom part of our portfolio, we're seeking tenants that are going to produce sales that are going to be closer to the top performers. And even if you've only got 10% or 11% of sales from tenants that are doing, on average, $1,000 a foot, our top producers in our portfolio, you're going to generate substantial increases. That's why we have the confidence that these rent spreads are sustainable. We have history as our guide and obviously, it doesn't guarantee future performance, but it is something that we are absolutely comfortable that these -- that, that rent spreads will continue to be a big driver of our same-center NOI growth going forward. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

Sometimes, you don't necessarily have the ability to recycle an anchor as quickly as you'd like to, so there are things -- generally small space is going to be more accessible to you than department store space. But look, it's what we do every day. It's what we do for a living. I mean we got one department that does nothing but the small shop spaces and another group that does nothing but the anchor stuff. And it's what we do, and they're equally important. They're both really important. And kind of what's left, which I think is left a little bit unsaid, is that as the department stores potentially reduce in numbers in terms of conventional department stores in the United States, then that's not necessarily a bad thing. It really gives us an opportunity to bring in other traffic generators, whatever those might be. But it also really creates more demand for in-line space. Because as the number of department store locations reduce, then that reduces the distribution points that manufacturers and creative folks have to distribute their merchandise. And so they become interested in in-line stores as a consequence. Take a look at an outlet mall. Outlet malls that we have at FOC and FON, we've got over 400,000 feet of small shop space in these malls. And they're fully occupied and that's because the manufacturers are not competing with the department stores as distribution points for them. So as this goes -- if this hand plays out over time, U.S. malls will begin to look more like the malls around the world. You go to Canada, for example. You've got 1, 1.5 department stores, maybe 2, in most of those big malls in Canada. And the small shop space could be easily 600,000, 700,000, 800,000 square feet. And I think the reason the small shop space there is fully occupied and fairly productive is that they -- it's the best distribution point for the manufacturers of the merchandise. So look, it's an evolutionary process, but we see that if you have must-have real estate, you're always going to have a good idea for it so long as you obviously are in touch with the pulse of the market, which we are."

It was a placeholder before, that's why we put it into the shadow pipeline. But it's evolving. These are the numbers that we see today. I think it is important to note that we believe we're being very conservative in the way that we are reporting this return to you. I'm aware of other owners of malls that when they bring in a replacement department store, sometimes they include what they think is going to be the uplift in market rents for the entire mall into the return they expect to get from that department store. And I'm not saying that in a critical way, I'm saying that because I'm just aware there are different ways of thinking about what your return is when you replace a department store. We're not doing in this situation. And we're looking at it, comparing it to the very substantial ramp that Sears would have been paying over the next couple of years. Now Sears, their lease expired anyway in a couple of years. So you could argue that the 8% return is really the more realistic return, but we wanted to -- look, we know that a lot of you are trying to do models based upon this information and that is as important as the return that we're reporting. And so we wanted to help you with the model. And let you know it's really 4% over what we're getting right now. As we think about it, we -- look, we do think about it long term. And we think about any investment in a replacement of the department store or any investment of that size in terms of IRRs over an expected holding period also. And the actual IRR on that particular investment, and this is just again going over the current rents that Sears is paying approaches 10%. So the company and the board felt very comfortable going forward that -- go ahead, Bob."

It's the nature of the business. But remember, I think one of my peers indicated to you in a call a few quarters ago, I think he was observing that because top 10 tenants, when he went public 20-some years ago, there's only 2 or 3 of them are still in business. Well, does that mean that the business went bad? Or does that mean that we have 8 great new top 10 tenants? And frankly, the answer is, we got 8 really good new guys. And the 8 guys that went away, they went away because they had matured. And I feel -- look, it all comes back to supply and demand. And we can dissect this to the nth degree. But the way that we look at things is that we think about not what is, but what can be. So we don't think about a space where a tenant's doing $300 a foot and say that's a $300 space, we look at it and say potentially that's a $300 space because it's a crappy tenant. We had a tenant at Santa Monica Place on the second level that I think was doing $300 a foot, Bobby, a 10,000-foot tenant, an apparel tenant and we didn't say, ""Oh, that's a $300 a foot location."" And we replaced them with a really good new tenant who is doing probably 3x that, which -- that's what we do every day. And by the way, it's not just us, it's our peers do that also. Now, I will tell you that we're able to do that because we have -- we have properties that are must-have properties. If we had commodity type of properties or we were located in some really secondary or tertiary markets or we were dealing with a portfolio of significantly lower-quality properties, we wouldn't be in a position to have this conversation. But we are in high-demand locations with great real estate, somewhat similar to high street retail and the demand characteristics and returns and rent growth that those have enjoyed over the years. It's supply and demand. It all comes down to that."

Second quarter reflected continued strong operating results, as evidenced by strength in most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. In addition, we completed our previously-announced $1.2 billion share repurchase program and also completed some significant financing transactions. We'll talk about all those in greater detail later in the call. 
For the quarter, FFO was $1.02 compared to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Same-center NOI increased by 6.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. This was positively impacted by about $6 million of lease termination revenue in the second quarter of 2016. This timing is somewhat accelerated compared to our guidance, which had most of the 2016 estimated lease termination revenues forecast in the third and fourth quarter. Our estimate for same-center NOI growth for the full year remains in the 4.5% to 5% range. 
The gross operating margin at the center improved to 70.3% in the quarter, up from 69.8% in the second quarter of last year. Bad debt expense was a relatively modest $1.7 million for the quarter, down from $2 million a year ago. As I mentioned, lease termination revenues at about $6 million for the quarter, that compared to $2.8 million last year. Year-to-date lease term fees are $9.4 million compared to $5.4 million for the first 6 months of last year. And our full year assumption for lease term revenue this year changed at $15 million. And when we make the decision and negotiate a lease termination agreement, it's typically a trade-off for making the business decision to take the cash now and incur the higher vacancy, loss of future minimum rent and charges until the space is re-leased. 
During second quarter, the average interest rate was 3.52%, up slightly from a year ago, which was 3.47%. The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics included debt to market cap at about 36% and interest coverage ratio a very strong 3.6x, a forward debt to EBITDA of 7.2x and a average debt maturity of 6.4 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains very good. We have closed or committed on 2 life company deals, and we're currently in the market with a large CMBS deal. On May 27, we closed a $375 million financing on North Bridge Mall. There was a 12-year fixed-rate loan at 3.68%, and we used a portion of those proceeds to pay off the old loan, which was $188 million, with an interest rate of 7.20%. That was a life company transaction. Another life company deal, which we'll be closing here in the next week or so is at The Village at Corte Madera. We're putting a $225 million fixed-rate loan in place, and that's a 12-year deal fixed at 3.50%. Again, some nice financing at historically low levels in terms of the interest rates. 
On July 5, we closed on an extension of our $1.5 billion line of credit. That line of credit was set to mature in April of 2018. And including our extension options on the new facility, it goes out to July of 2021 and reduces our borrowing rate to about LIBOR plus 1.33%, about a 70 -- 17, excuse me, 17 basis point improvement from our old facility. All right. Quarter end, that's -- the balance on their facility was about $1 billion. However, we've got some significant financings that will take place in the third and fourth quarter. We should 
generate $350 million of excess proceeds from Fresno, which is currently unencumbered. We're in the market with that right now. It's going to be a CMBS transaction. Term is expected to be 10 years. We're getting bids now. We're getting some very, very strong quotes. We would expect that to close in September. In addition, we'll have about $75 million of excess proceeds from the closing of Corte Madera. And in addition, later this year, Eastland is an unencumbered asset that we will probably finance and that could be as much as $175 million. So with that, it would comfortably put our line of credit outstanding balance at $500 million or less. 
We concluded our third $400 million accelerated stock repurchase program on July 11. This was part of a board-authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program that was announced in October. We've used 3 separate investment banks to execute these ASR programs. The summary results were: we invested the entire $1.2 billion; the average share price on all 3 combined was $78.62; and the total number of shares repurchased was 15.3 million shares, roughly 9.6% of our shares outstanding. 
This day, on the guidance, again, we reaffirm guidance today of $4.05 to $4.15 for the full year. And just to reiterate, the remaining 2 quarters, we estimate of that FFO for the full year, 25% or so will be in the third quarter and 29% of that total in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Bob to discuss leasing and tenant environment."

Leasing activity during the second quarter remained strong, reflecting demand from the retailers for The Macerich portfolio. 
First, let me talk about leasing spreads. Trailing 12 months leasing spreads increased to 16.1% from 15.4% during the previous quarter. Regionally, East and West Coast properties have produced the highest leasing spreads. Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $57.31 per square foot. During the second quarter, a total of 848,000 square feet of leases were signed, up from 733,000 square feet in the previous quarter. The average term signed in the second quarter increased to 6.0 years. 
Occupancy. Leasing levels at the end of the second quarter were 95.0%. This represents a 50 basis points year-over-year decline and a 10 basis point decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we discussed in the last earnings call, the decline in year-over-year occupancy was primarily caused by the movement of Fashion Outlets of Niagara and SouthPark out of the development portfolio into the stabilized pool. The occupancy also reflects the disposition of Capitola Mall and the acquisition of Country Club Plaza. Temporary occupancy improved at the end of the second quarter, dropping 30 basis points from the previous quarter to 5.2%. 
Sales. Portfolio of sales were $626 per square foot compared to $623 on a year-over-year basis. Same-center sales per square foot were $644 compared to $629 for the year earlier period. This is a 2.4% increase. Sales were strongest in the West Coast centers, and the categories that showed the strongest sales during the second quarter were beauty and cosmetics, athletic footwear, athleisure and jewelry. 
I want to take a minute and talk about tenant demand. Within our portfolio, tenant interest remained strongest in the higher-productivity centers, the higher growth markets and the coastal locations. This demand allows us to replace underproductive or struggling stores with those retailers looking to expand. Demand is strongest among: one, core brands renewing and expanding existing locations; two, brand extensions from successful retailers; three, foreign-based retailers; and four, online retailers migrating to in-line stores. Within the last category of online retailers, we see many companies building the infrastructure to open brick-and-mortar locations in a traditional store rollout program. Some examples of this include Blue Nile, Amazon, Peloton, Warby Parker and Bonobos. 
We are also focusing on bringing online retailers into the centers by reducing the physical and economic barriers to entry. Examples of this strategy include stores such as Combatant Gentlemen, Blink [ph], Beta [ph] and WithMe. It is clear the universe of online retailers will expand in our shopping centers. Some will take a traditional approach to store rollouts and others will be nurtured through nontraditional canvassing and deal structures. This represents a growing opportunity within our portfolio. 
Development. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce the redevelopment of an existing Sears store located at Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. This center is 1 of 3 important assets owned by Macerich in the New York boroughs and serves a trade area of approximately 4 million residents. Since Macerich's acquisition in 2012, we have worked to improve Kings Plaza's merchandise mix, anchor lineup, sales productivity, physical appearance, marketing and property operations. Our goal has been to elevate Kings Plaza to the level that we have achieved at Queens Center. The redevelopment of the Sears building represents a major step in that direction. Sears will be replaced with 6 to 8 large-format retailers and restaurants, all orientated at around a dramatic 4-story atrium. The redevelopment will be anchored by new Primark and Zara flagship stores. We expect these retailers to generate a threefold increase in sales and foot traffic compared to the existing Sears spot. Equally as important, they will open the door to new specialty stores, who have not historically been ready to locate at the center. From the perspective of Macerich's portfolio, we are able to significantly reduce our rental exposure to Sears while increasing our footprint with both Zara and Primark as well as improving our position in the New York marketplace. Sears will no longer be a top 10 rent payer within our portfolio. The Macerich portfolio is well suited for Primark's entry into the East Coast markets. In June, Primark had a successful opening at Danbury Fair, which was followed in July with their opening at Freehold Raceway. Both of these locations repurpose the Sears anchor, and initial reports indicate a significant increase in foot traffic and sales at these centers. Kings Plaza will represent Primark's third location with Macerich. We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number in the coming months. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Art."

As you can see, we had another very strong quarter from an operating viewpoint. More importantly, from my viewpoint, we also are very pleased to have completed our portfolio management and capital allocation strategy through the completion of our share buyback program. You'll remember that we announced that program literally about 9 months ago and not -- unlike certain other folks, we completed the program in very short order. We did exactly what we said we were going to do. We're very happy to have it behind us. We think that it was a great transaction, that gave us the capital to invest into the balance of our portfolio at what we feel is a substantial discount to our NAV. And we're pleased to have it behind us so that the focus going forward can be on the operating fundamentals of the company as well as our very strong redevelopment and development pipeline. 
I want to touch upon a topic that has been -- a justifiable topic in terms of questions that a lot of investors and the analytical community has asked themselves. And that has to do with rent spreads and whether or not in an environment where you have decelerating sales or sales that are not growing like they used to grow, ""Can you continue to have rent growth in the manner that we've enjoyed and our peers have enjoyed over a long period of time?"" It's -- like I said, it's a legitimate question, and especially when you look at other property types where it's not usual to have positive rent spreads continue year in and year out. But it really comes back down to just the laws of supply and demand. We are in the real estate business, and supply and demand is the key to everything. Looking backwards, past performance cannot be a guarantee of future results, as they say. But over the past 10 years, we've averaged 17.4% positive rent spreads over the past 40 quarters. We've had high water marks of 28%. Low water marks in 2009 of 7%, give or take. But on average, we've averaged 17%. I will tell you that if our rent spreads come in at 13% or they come in at 21%, I don't get excited about that one way or the other because I know that, fundamentally, when I think about our mark-to-market, that the ability to generate mid-teen type of rent spreads is embedded within our portfolio. 
As you look at our property type, and you look at regional class A malls, and you think about the universe of the supply of that product, the supply of that product is, let's say, that it's 400 or 500 regional malls. And when we think about that, that product type in terms of supply, we can look to, by analogy, high street retail, which is also a very low supply, high demand sector. And there have been studies that have been done, more studies that have been done in the regional mall class A sector as it relates to high street, that it is a property type that has shown significant, well above-average rent growth over very long periods of time. And that's what we've enjoyed in our portfolio. That's what our peers with Class A malls have enjoyed in their portfolios. History has been our -- has supported that view, and the fundamentals that we're sitting on support our optimism for this to go forward. 
When we think about the demand side of the transaction in terms of tenant demand for space, a lot of folks tend to focus on the 1 or 2 names that have gone bankrupt recently -- or the 1 or 2 names that people are worried about going bankrupt. But they tend not to focus on the 30 or 40 or 50 names of retailers that have got brand extensions or are just growing their portfolio or now with the recent events with Brexit, we have tenants that have got global expansion plans that are upping their expansion conversations about their expansion in the U.S., which is creating incremental demand. You think about other factors that may or may not influence our demand, and people worry at times about department stores. And we've had more than one of our department stores who said the problem with their sales is mall traffic. Mr. Les Wexner made -- had a great quote on this point, and I'll probably butcher it. But basically, he said ""The trouble with department stores is not mall traffic. The trouble with mall traffic is the department stores."" What he is basically saying is that the department stores are not pulling their weight. You take a look at the parking lots of more than one of our department stores and in some of our malls, and they're not as busy as the other parking lots. This creates opportunity. We and our other Class A mall peers have had great history of replacing our department stores that have become unproductive over time with better uses. And we see this as a great opportunity going forward. Anecdotally, we think that the Kings Plaza re-merchandising opportunity is going to be dramatic in terms of what that's going to do for mall traffic. 
People worry when they think about rent spreads, about whether or not e-commerce is going to drain sales away from the malls and to reduce the demand for space in the malls. In fact, the advent of digital commerce creates new sources of demand for us in that it creates new tenants that are born digitally and then want to migrate to brick-and-mortar locations. And we are seeing this throughout our portfolio. 
And finally, the thing that probably creates the most anxiety about mall spreads, rent spreads, is when people see sales flat for a certain period of time. And then that causes them anxiety. And that's legitimate for that anxiety. But what I would point to you is this, that if you have a fundamentally very strong portfolio, and you have no new supply being created, and you have demand increasing, then you're going to be able to lease that portfolio and you're going to be able to lease it at strong rents. We took a look a couple of years ago, and we dissected sales within our centers. And we said, ""If we take the top 2/3 in each tenant category, what are those tenants doing in terms of sales productivity? And what are the bottom 1/3 of the tenants in our portfolio doing in terms of sales productivity?"" Because that's generally the way we think about things. We tend to think about constantly the bottom 20, the 30% of the producers in our malls as being merchandisers that we're going to want to recapture over a period of time and to replace with names that are more reflective of the merchants that people want to do business with today. 
Here are some numbers. In our top 30 centers, our average sales per square foot are $726 a square foot. That doesn't really tell the story. Within each apparel -- within each tenant category, whether it'd be apparel, shoes, jewelry, general, the top 2/3 within each category in these centers did $1,028 a square foot. And they comprised about 60% of the GLA in those centers. The bottom 1/3 of the retailers in each of the respective categories in those centers averaged about $313 a square foot. So it's really a tale of 2 cities here. You got the great producers, and then you got the folks that are lagging. You've got 2/3 of your tenants within our top 30 properties are averaging over $1,000 a foot, 1/3 of our tenants by category are averaging $300 a square foot. So our job is simply to weed out the people that are unproductive and to replace them with the tenants that are more reflective of the top 2/3. And when we look at this -- the cost of occupancies within our portfolio, you can't just look at the homogenized number. Our average cost of occupancy in these 30 centers is 13.5%. So you can debate all day about, ""Oh, can you push that number?"" But the reality is, that our top 2/3 of the tenants in that -- in those top 30 centers, they do over $1,000 a foot and their occupancy cost is under 11%. So when those tenants -- when their leases expire, we -- they're sitting on substantial rent growth from the time that they signed their lease, and they can easily afford to pay rents that would generate in some 15% or so rent spreads for us. And then when we think about pruning out the bottom part of our portfolio, we're seeking tenants that are going to produce sales that are going to be closer to the top performers. And even if you've only got 10% or 11% of sales from tenants that are doing, on average, $1,000 a foot, our top producers in our portfolio, you're going to generate substantial increases. That's why we have the confidence that these rent spreads are sustainable. We have history as our guide and obviously, it doesn't guarantee future performance, but it is something that we are absolutely comfortable that these -- that, that rent spreads will continue to be a big driver of our same-center NOI growth going forward. 
And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

Sometimes, you don't necessarily have the ability to recycle an anchor as quickly as you'd like to, so there are things -- generally small space is going to be more accessible to you than department store space. But look, it's what we do every day. It's what we do for a living. I mean we got one department that does nothing but the small shop spaces and another group that does nothing but the anchor stuff. And it's what we do, and they're equally important. They're both really important. And kind of what's left, which I think is left a little bit unsaid, is that as the department stores potentially reduce in numbers in terms of conventional department stores in the United States, then that's not necessarily a bad thing. It really gives us an opportunity to bring in other traffic generators, whatever those might be. But it also really creates more demand for in-line space. Because as the number of department store locations reduce, then that reduces the distribution points that manufacturers and creative folks have to distribute their merchandise. And so they become interested in in-line stores as a consequence. Take a look at an outlet mall. Outlet malls that we have at FOC and FON, we've got over 400,000 feet of small shop space in these malls. And they're fully occupied and that's because the manufacturers are not competing with the department stores as distribution points for them. So as this goes -- if this hand plays out over time, U.S. malls will begin to look more like the malls around the world. You go to Canada, for example. You've got 1, 1.5 department stores, maybe 2, in most of those big malls in Canada. And the small shop space could be easily 600,000, 700,000, 800,000 square feet. And I think the reason the small shop space there is fully occupied and fairly productive is that they -- it's the best distribution point for the manufacturers of the merchandise. So look, it's an evolutionary process, but we see that if you have must-have real estate, you're always going to have a good idea for it so long as you obviously are in touch with the pulse of the market, which we are."

Well, as I commented in my remarks, a big part of the quarter is, we had a significant amount of lease term revenue that happened in the third quarter and more of our forecast was for that to be in the third and fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, second quarter. We had roughly $6 million. Historically, and what we've forecasted for the year, we forecast $15 million, but the bulk of that we had forecast in the third and fourth quarter. So that got accelerated a little bit. And as a result of that moving earlier in the year, it's going to mean that we're not going to see the same kind of growth in the third and fourth quarter. And I think in that -- Bobby may want to comment on this as well, I think also to the extent we have bankruptcies, we're going to feel that more in the third and fourth quarter. Some of those tenants remained in occupancy through the second quarter. And also when you make the business decision, and it is a business decision to take a lease termination payment, that means you're taking that. But in exchange for that, you're going to lose minimum rent revenue in the second half of the year. And that's a little bit of what we're going to face in the third and fourth quarter."

I think it is important to note that we believe we're being very conservative in the way that we are reporting this return to you. I'm aware of other owners of malls that when they bring in a replacement department store, sometimes they include what they think is going to be the uplift in market rents for the entire mall into the return they expect to get from that department store. And I'm not saying that in a critical way, I'm saying that because I'm just aware there are different ways of thinking about what your return is when you replace a department store. We're not doing in this situation. And we're looking at it, comparing it to the very substantial ramp that Sears would have been paying over the next couple of years. Now Sears, their lease expired anyway in a couple of years. So you could argue that the 8% return is really the more realistic return, but we wanted to -- look, we know that a lot of you are trying to do models based upon this information and that is as important as the return that we're reporting. And so we wanted to help you with the model. And let you know it's really 4% over what we're getting right now. As we think about it, we -- look, we do think about it long term. And we think about any investment in a replacement of the department store or any investment of that size in terms of IRRs over an expected holding period also. And the actual IRR on that particular investment, and this is just again going over the current rents that Sears is paying approaches 10%. So the company and the board felt very comfortable going forward that -- go ahead, Bob."

It's the nature of the business. But remember, I think one of my peers indicated to you in a call a few quarters ago, I think he was observing that because top 10 tenants, when he went public 20-some years ago, there's only 2 or 3 of them are still in business. Well, does that mean that the business went bad? Or does that mean that we have 8 great new top 10 tenants? And frankly, the answer is, we got 8 really good new guys. And the 8 guys that went away, they went away because they had matured. And I feel -- look, it all comes back to supply and demand. And we can dissect this to the nth degree. But the way that we look at things is that we think about not what is, but what can be. So we don't think about a space where a tenant's doing $300 a foot and say that's a $300 space, we look at it and say potentially that's a $300 space because it's a crappy tenant. We had a tenant at Santa Monica Place on the second level that I think was doing $300 a foot, Bobby, a 10,000-foot tenant, an apparel tenant and we didn't say, ""Oh, that's a $300 a foot location."" And we replaced them with a really good new tenant who is doing probably 3x that, which -- that's what we do every day. And by the way, it's not just us, it's our peers do that also. Now, I will tell you that we're able to do that because we have -- we have properties that are must-have properties. If we had commodity type of properties or we were located in some really secondary or tertiary markets or we were dealing with a portfolio of significantly lower-quality properties, we wouldn't be in a position to have this conversation. But we are in high-demand locations with great real estate, somewhat similar to high street retail and the demand characteristics and returns and rent growth that those have enjoyed over the years. It's supply and demand. It all comes down to that."

If we happen to run out of time and you still have questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call, or John or Jean. 
The third quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $1.04 per share, up from $1.01 in the third quarter of last year. 
Same-center NOI increased by 4.2% compared to the third quarter of '15, which was a very tough comp quarter that was up 7%. This was positively impacted by $7.8 million of lease termination revenues in the third quarter. So most cases, we were accelerating revenue we would have received in the fourth quarter and beyond into the third quarter. 
Year-to-date our same-center NOI growth is 6%. And as we discussed in our last earnings calls, most of the impact of the major tenet bankruptcies this year will be felt in the third and fourth quarter, which means lower same-center NOI growth in the third and fourth quarter than we saw in the first half of the year.
Our same-center estimate for NOI for the year, the range being tightened to 4.5 to 4.75. As we look forward into 2017, we're not giving full guidance for the year, but we are going to give some guidance on our expectation for same-center NOI growth. It will be down slightly from this year, and we expect the range of 3% to 4% same-center growth in 2017. Keep in mind that for the first half of 2016, we have the comparative benefit of the expense cuts that were initiated in the third quarter of '15. We will not have that comparative benefit as we compare 2017 to 2016. 
Our gross operating margin on a same-center basis for the quarter improved to 69.6%. That was up from 68.5% in the third quarter of '15. And if we compare it to the third quarter of '14, 2 years ago, it's a 399-basis-point improvement. 
Year-to-date, the same-center gross margin was 69.33%, up from 67.9% during the same period of last year. Bad debt expense was a modest 300,000 for the quarter, down compared to $800,000 in the third quarter of last year. 
As I mentioned previously, lease termination fees were $7.8 million for the quarter. That compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Most of these termination fees came from Sears of Kings Plaza where we exercised our right to terminate their lease early. This had the effect of accelerating about $2.5 million of rent that would have been paid in the fourth quarter into the third. 
During the third quarter, the average interest rate was 3.48%, up slightly from a year ago when it was 3.3.%. 
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, our balance sheet metrics were healthy with debt-to-market cap of 37%, an interest coverage ratio of over 3.5x; debt-to-EBDA on a forward basis of 7.2%; and the average debt maturity after the financing of the Financing of Fashion Fair, which happened on October 6, is now over 6.5 years. 
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains good. A couple of examples. On October 6, we closed the $325 million loan on the previously unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. It was a CMBS loan, the first one we've done in a while. 10-year fixed-rate of net interest rate of 3.59%. The proceeds from that financing were used to pay down our line of credit, with subsequent to that pay down is approximately 100 -- excuse me, $750 million outstanding. 
Also on August 5, we closed on a $225 million loan on The Village at Corte Madera. That was a life insurance company loan. The term was 12 years and has a fixed interest rate of 3.5%. 
I'm sure you saw in this morning's press release that we tightened our previous estimate of diluted FFO per share, and we narrowed the range to 4 05 to 4 10. That was down from 4 05 to 4 15. The revised FFO guidance comes primarily from reducing the midpoint of the range through the year on same-center NOI to 4.5% to 4.75%. That is down from an original guidance range of 4.5 to 5. 
The dilution from the sale of capital of the mall, which was not included in the initial guidance, is offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt on Flagstaff, which also is not in the original guidance. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

Recent activity during the third quarter was consistent with the first half of the year, producing strong releasing spreads and stable occupancies. 
Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 16.1%. This is unchanged from the second quarter. Leasing spreads were relatively consistent through all the regions. 
Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $56.52. 
During the third quarter, a total of 803,000 square feet of leases were signed, down slightly from the previous quarter. The average term for leases signed in the third quarter increased to 7 years. 
Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.3%. This represents a 30-basis-point increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Portfolio sales were $626 per square foot. And on a same-center basis, sales were up 1.3% year-over-year. 
I'm going to talk a minute about development. The third quarter represented an important milestone for the company as the developments of Broadway Plaza and Green Acres Commons celebrated their official grand openings. These 2 projects are illustrative of the company's strong development skills, taking unique retail locations and extending their market dominance through densification. Combined, these 2 developments represented an investment of $263 million and will produce a blended stabilized return over 9%. 
Over 10 years in the making, the expansion of Broadway Plaza began in 2012 when Neiman Marcus joined the existing anchors Nordstrom and Macy's at the center. We are extremely pleased with the merchandise mixed created at Broadway Plaza, and more importantly, the initial sales results from the tenants. The new space is 94% leased, and we anticipate all the retailers will be opened by this holiday season. 
Green Acres Commons celebrated its grand opening on October sixth. These two-level power center, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, is a strong addition to the Green Acres retail campus and provides a home for many big box retailers looking to tap this attractive New York market. 
There were also a number of important anchor openings in the portfolio. This served to further increase the drop from these established retail centers. 
At Fashion Outlets at Chicago, Nordstrom Rack opened its store on September 30. The center is now only 1 of 2 outlet venues in the U.S. that feature Nordstrom Rack, Saks OFF 5TH, Neimans Last Call, Bloomingdale's outlet and Barney's as its anchors. 
Dick's Sporting Goods opened a new store at The Oaks on October 11. In addition, 3 restaurants were added adjacent to Dick's. And finally, JCPenney had a very strong grand opening at Inland Center on October 21. The reception from the community was outstanding. 
I'm going to take a minute to talk about 10 of bankruptcies. There has been significant tension surrounding the health of certain specialty stores tenants. You recall, we entered 2016 cautious in our expectations regarding tenant bankruptcy. During the third quarter, the 3 most prominent bankruptcies of 2016 were resolved, albeit in very different fashions. First, the bankruptcy of Sports Authority resulted in the liquidation of the entire chain. Almost all the stores were closed except for a small number of leases purchased by other retailers. Second, PacSun completed their restructuring with the major creditor maintaining control of the company. PacSun emerged from bankruptcy in September with a restructured balance sheet and most of its store fleet intact.  Finally, Aeropostale will emerge under the control of a consortium of buyers. It is anticipated that up to 500 stores will be retained. 
Most of the economic impact from these bankruptcies will be felt during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. As Art has discussed in the past, throughout the portfolio, our focus is to reduce the exposure to weaker, lower productivity tenants well before their enter the restructuring process. For example, in 2012, Aeropostale had 45 stores in our portfolio. When they entered bankruptcy, this number had been reduced to 27. This was achieved through the disposition of lower productivity centers replace the lease expiration with more productive tenants and early termination when the tenants still have the financial resources to pay termination fees. We expect our exposure with Aeropostale at the end of 2016 to be 19 store locations or approximately 78,000 square-feet. 
Looking forward to our leasing focus in the coming year will be the repurpose underproductive anchor department stores and replace the vacancy caused by recent tenant bankruptcies and early termination agreements. We believe opportunity exist in the anchor buildings by tapping demand from the big-box and large formats at specialty retailers. As discussed on the last earnings call, the opportunity to retenant the Sears box at Kings Plaza with retailers that include Primark and Zara represents a unique opportunity to move the center to the next level in terms of traffic, sales productivity and merchandise mix. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

As you can see from our numbers and our announcements, we had a very strong quarter. Our leasing spreads remained extremely strong, consistent with our belief that we have embedded growth within our portfolio. We culminated an 18-month period of improving operating margins and achieved our goal of improving our operating margins by 400 basis points. And as Bob pointed out, during the quarter, we successfully completed on-time, on-budget and at the returns that were expected, the Green Acres expansion and the Broadway Plaza expansion. 
The Broadway Plaza expansion is an important one to contemplate. Private Plaza recently celebrated its 75th year in business, 75 years. We bought Broadway Plaza about 31 years ago, and at the time, it had an NOI of $3 million. Upon stabilization, we anticipate that NOI to be roughly $40 million. So this is testimony that great real estate in the hands of great management with a well-capitalized balance sheet can succeed in spite of any challenges to the retail environment and any changes to the retail environment. 
Our future we see to be very strong and bright. I am pleased, however, in the context of concerns over the retail environment that at this point in time with the completion of the Green Acres and the Broadway Plaza expansion, we have modest exposure in terms of our capital spend to a possible weak retail environment going forward over the near term. We only Philadelphia and Kings Plaza in process, and both of those are proceeding as planned in terms of the merchandising and releasing. 
Having said all of that, we feel the pain of our investors and those of you on this call that follow our company and our industry. Back on August 1, only a little less than 3 months ago, Mace, which was trading at $91 a share in the RMC, was at $12.80. Today, we are roughly at $72 a share and the RMC is down to $11.05. Malls as a sector are obviously, down 500 to 600 basis points more than the other sectors that comprise the RMC. Its the fundamentals about the mall business that has caused us to underperform. I would say from the viewpoint of our management that we see our fundamentals to be at least as strong today as we were 3 months ago, 6 months ago and 9 months ago. But it is hard to ignore the difference in terms of the performance of the sector. 
If we're going to look at what event have happened during the last 3 months that potentially led to, and has led to, this underperformance, it's hard to ignore the August 11 announcement by Macy's that they were closing 100 department stores. Many of our investors have expressed concern over this. 
I want to share with you our view about those store closures. First of all, it is healthy for any retailer to prudently prune their portfolio and to weed out unproductive business units and to focus their attention on their more productive business units. That's what we do as a company. Closing stores is a prudent thing and a stronger Macy's makes for a stronger mall base. As I look at our exposure to Macy's and to these closures, it's our understanding that when those closures are announced, that we will have one store in our portfolio at that point in time that will be on the closure list and we see the closure of that store to be a positive, not a negative. It's most likely going to be a West L.A. store and it's a situation that is ready for redevelopment as we discussed in previous calls. 
As I think further about department stores and I think about the anxiety that people have about department stores, I also think about regarding what has happened over the past 10 or 12 years with department stores. And one of the seminal events that happened in the department store industry was in 2005 when Macy's bought May company, and that caused a significant consolidation within the department store business. The combination of that event and the general underperformance of department stores over the last 10 or 12 years have actually been arguably a positive for monitors. I know that seems strange for me to say that, but let me share with you the reason why. 
With the consolidation of Macy's and makeup going back to 11 years ago, many of the brands that really make up the excitement within a department store began to look at the balance of power that they had on their negotiations with department stores and decided that they wanted to add another channel of distribution to their omni-channel approach. I think albeit at 11 years ago, I doubt that word will be used that much. But many of the great brands have relied predominantly on the distribution to be wholesale distribution through the department stores. And over a period of time, those brands have decided to open up full-price retail stores, and in many cases, flagship stores. And they comprised many of the best names that we have in the mall today. Names like , Michael Kors, Allyn Fisher, Hugo Boss, All Saints, Louis Vuitton, Tori Burch, Ted Baker, Armani, Mac Cosmetics, Burberry, True Religion, the list goes on. And we see that, that trend continuing, which is a trend that, as I have mentioned in the past, is a trend that you see generally in place in the global portfolios of other owners of shopping centers around the world. 
So we see the store closures of Macy's to be a positive, not a negative. We see its impact on Macerich to be a positive, not a negative. And as I look at the overall health of the department store business, let's not loose sight of the fact that it was only 3 years ago that many folks that probably are on this call right now felt that JCPenney was doomed in terms of their future. And at that point in time, we were bit of an outlie where we said, “Look, the one name that we see out there that we think is going to be in existence as a retailer 5 or 10 years after 2013 is going to be JCPenney.” And there's been much written about their turnaround. I can tell you that JCPenney stores look better than ever, and we're very happy with the new Penney store that we just t opened in center. 
Again, I feel your pain. I understand it, and -- but the fundamentals that we have here remain very strong. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Here in New York, you obviously got Kings and Queens that would presumably compete with some of the street retail locations. And in Chicago, you have 500 North Michigan that's on The Avenue as well as in line. Have you noticed a change in the way that retailers as you talk to them? As they're viewing their street retail presence versus the mall present? My point is do the retailers think of those in concert? Or do they think of each as different and The Street retail is a different leasing decision than the mall retail? Or within a certain metro or submarket, maybe we're together and it's just basically where they think they can get more traffic?"

Kings and Queens really don't compete with The Street retail in Manhattan or New York. It's a more traditional mall mix, and their strength really comes from the density of the population and the lack of alternatives for these retailers. Northbridge has a little bit of both. It has both sort of the traditional mall space as well as some street space. Generally, there's a pretty big distinction between what the retailers are trying to achieve on The Street on these flagship locations or inside the mall. So they tend to be different decision. And often, the real estate decision is controlled by different people within the retailer. So there's not really a situation where somebody says I'm going to -- The Street market is getting soft. I'm going to put more resources into the mall or vice versa.” They're really, in our mind, 2 independent decisions."

So we see next year being fairly normal year. Wrestling through the final aspects of some of the bankruptcies from this year.

Our sector and our company and, in particular, our properties. And we felt that it was important a year ago to monetize that view and to show the rest all of you that, that was the way that we saw that private markets valued our assets. We felt at the time that there was a significant disconnect between the private market views in our company and the public markets views. The private markets views on our asset base have not changed. The -- if we were to go out today and talk about a similar pool of assets that we joint ventured, I would suspect that we'll be looking at a similar execution. But the discrepancy and the disparity and the percentage differential between the public market and the private market valuations of our company have arguably never been greater than they are today. So if that is true, it is a fact and we'll keep a post at it. In the meantime, what we need to do is to continue to earn the appreciation for our portfolio by increasing the income and the valuation of each of our assets, which is what we're doing. But the public market/private market disparity has probably, I can't remember what's been greater, but it's certainly very high today and much higher than it was a year ago."

The third quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $1.04 per share, up from $1.01 in the third quarter of last year.
Same-center NOI increased by 4.2% compared to the third quarter of '15, which was a very tough comp quarter that was up 7%. This was positively impacted by $7.8 million of lease termination revenues in the third quarter. So in most cases, we were accelerating revenue we would have received in the fourth quarter and beyond into the third quarter.
Year-to-date, our same-center NOI growth is 6%. And as we discussed in our last earnings calls, most of the impact of the major tenant bankruptcies this year will be felt in the third and fourth quarter, which means lower same-center NOI growth in the third and fourth quarter than we saw in the first half of the year.
Our same-center estimate for NOI for the year, the range being tightened to 4.5 to 4.75. As we look forward into 2017, we're not giving full guidance for the year, but we are going to give some guidance on our expectation for same-center NOI growth. It will be down slightly from this year, and we expect the range of 3% to 4% same-center growth in 2017. Keep in mind that for the first half of 2016, we had the comparative benefit of the expense cuts that were initiated in the third quarter of '15. We will not have that comparative benefit as we compare 2017 to 2016.
Our gross operating margin on a same-center basis for the quarter improved to 69.6%. That was up from 68.5% in the third quarter of '15. And if we compare it to the third quarter of '14, 2 years ago, it's a 399-basis-point improvement.
Year-to-date, the same-center gross margin was 69.33%, up from 67.9% during the same period of last year. Bad debt expense was a modest 300,000 for the quarter, down compared to $800,000 in the third quarter of last year.
As I mentioned previously, lease termination fees were $7.8 million for the quarter. That compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Most of these termination fees came from Sears and Kings Plaza, where we exercised our right to terminate their lease early. This had the effect of accelerating about $2.5 million of rent that would have been paid in the fourth quarter into the third.
During the third quarter, the average interest rate was 3.48%, up slightly from a year ago when it was 3.3%.
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, our balance sheet metrics were healthy with debt-to-market cap at 37%, an interest coverage ratio of over 3.5x, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis of 7.2%, and the average debt maturity after the financing of Fresno Fashion Fair, which happened on October 6, is now over 6.5 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains good. A couple of examples. On October 6, we closed the $325 million loan on the previously unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. It was a CMBS loan, the first one we've done in a while, 10-year fixed-rate loan with an interest rate of 3.59%. The proceeds from that financing were used to pay down our line of credit, with subsequent to that paydown is approximately 100 -- or excuse me, $750 million outstanding.
Also on August 5, we closed on a $225 million loan on The Village at Corte Madera. That was a life insurance company loan. The term is 12 years and had a fixed interest rate of 3.5%.
I'm sure you saw in this morning's press release that we tightened our previous estimate of diluted FFO per share, and we narrowed the range to 4.05 to 4.10. That was down from 4.05 to 4.15. The revised FFO guidance comes primarily from reducing the midpoint of the range through the year on same-center NOI to 4.5 to 4.75. That is down from our original guidance range of 4.5 to 5.
The dilution from the sale of Capitola Mall, which was not included in the initial guidance, is offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt on Flagstaff, which also is not in the original guidance.
And now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

Leasing activity during the third quarter was consistent with the first half of the year, producing strong releasing spreads and stable occupancies.
Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 16.1%. This is unchanged from the second quarter. Leasing spreads were relatively consistent through all of the regions.
Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $56.52.
During the third quarter, a total of 803,000 square feet of leases were signed, down slightly from the previous quarter. The average term for leases signed in the third quarter increased to 7 years.
Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.3%. This represents a 30-basis-point increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Portfolio sales were $626 per square foot, and on a same-center basis, sales were up 1.3% year-over-year.
I'm going to talk a minute about development. The third quarter represented an important milestone for the company as the developments at Broadway Plaza and Green Acres Commons celebrated their official grand openings. These 2 projects are illustrative of the company's strong development skills, taking unique retail locations and extending their market dominance through densification. Combined, these 2 developments represented an investment of $263 million and will produce a blended stabilized return over 9%.
Over 10 years in the making, the expansion of Broadway Plaza began in 2012 when Neiman Marcus joined existing anchors Nordstrom and Macy's at the center. We are extremely pleased with the merchandise mix created at Broadway Plaza and, more importantly, the initial sales results from the tenants. The new space is 94% leased, and we anticipate all the retailers will be opened by this holiday season.
Green Acres Commons celebrated its grand opening on October 6. These 2-level power center anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods is a strong addition to the Green Acres retail campus and provides a home for many big box retailers looking to tap this attractive New York market.
There were also a number of important anchor openings in the portfolio. This served to further increase the draw out from these established retail centers.
At Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Nordstrom Rack opened its store on September 30. The center is now only 1 of 2 outlet venues in the U.S. that feature Nordstrom Rack, Saks OFF 5TH, Neiman's Last Call, Bloomingdale's outlet and Barney's as its anchors.
Dick's Sporting Goods opened a new store at The Oaks on October 11. In addition, 3 restaurants were added adjacent to Dick's. And finally, JCPenney had a very strong grand opening at Inland Center on October 21. The reception from the community was outstanding.
I'm going to take a minute to talk about tenant bankruptcies. There has been significant attention surrounding the health of certain specialty store tenants. You'll recall we entered 2016 cautious in our expectations regarding tenant bankruptcy. During the third quarter, the 3 most prominent bankruptcies of 2016 were resolved, albeit in very different fashions. First, the bankruptcy of Sports Authority resulted in the liquidation of the entire chain. Almost all the stores were closed except for a small number of leases purchased by other retailers. Second, PacSun completed their restructuring with the major creditor maintaining control of the company. PacSun emerged from bankruptcy in September with a restructured balance sheet and most of its store fleet intact. Finally, Aeropostale will emerge under the control of a consortium of buyers. It is anticipated that up to 500 stores will be retained.
Most of the economic impact from these bankruptcies will be felt during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. As Art has discussed in the past, throughout the portfolio, our focus is to reduce the exposure to weaker, lower productivity tenants well before they enter the restructuring process. For example, in 2012, Aeropostale had 45 stores in our portfolio. When they entered bankruptcy, this number had been reduced to 27. This was achieved through the disposition of lower productivity centers, replace tenant lease expiration with more productive tenants and early termination when the tenants still had the financial resources to pay termination fees. We expect our exposure with Aeropostale at the end of 2016 to be 19 store locations or approximately 78,000 square feet.
Looking forward, our leasing focus in the coming year will be to repurpose underproductive anchor department stores and replace the vacancy caused by recent tenant bankruptcies and early termination agreements. We believe opportunity exists in the anchor buildings by tapping demand from the big box and large format specialty retailers. As discussed on the last earnings call, the opportunity to retenant the Sears box at Kings Plaza with retailers that include Primark and Zara represents a unique opportunity to move the center to the next level in terms of traffic, sales productivity and merchandise mix.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

As you can see from our numbers and our announcements, we had a very strong quarter. Our leasing spreads remained extremely strong, consistent with our belief that we have embedded growth within our portfolio. We culminated an 18-month period of improving operating margins and achieved our goal of improving our operating margins by 400 basis points. And as Bob pointed out, during the quarter, we successfully completed on-time, on-budget and at the returns that were expected the Green Acres expansion and the Broadway Plaza expansion.
The Broadway Plaza expansion is an important one to contemplate. Broadway Plaza recently celebrated its 75th year in business, 75 years. We bought Broadway Plaza about 31 years ago, and at the time, it had an NOI of $3 million. Upon stabilization, we anticipate that NOI to be roughly $40 million. So this is testimony that great real estate in the hands of great management with a well-capitalized balance sheet can succeed in spite of any challenges to the retail environment and any changes to the retail environment.
Our future we see to be very strong and bright. I am pleased, however, in the context of concerns over the retail environment that at this point in time, with the completion of the Green Acres and the Broadway Plaza expansion, we have modest exposure in terms of our capital spend to a possible weak retail environment going forward over the near term. We only have Philadelphia and Kings Plaza in process, and both of those are proceeding as planned in terms of the merchandising and releasing.
Having said all of that, we feel the pain of our investors and those of you on this call that follow our company and our industry. Back on August 1, only a little less than 3 months ago, Macerich was trading at $91 a share and the RMZ was at $12.80. Today, we are roughly at $72 a share and the RMZ is down to $11.05. Malls as a sector are obviously down 500 to 600 basis points more than the other sectors that comprise the RMZ. It's the fundamentals about the mall business that has caused us to underperform. I would say from the viewpoint of our management that we see our fundamentals to be at least as strong today as we were 3 months ago, 6 months ago and 9 months ago. But it is hard to ignore the difference in terms of the performance of the sector.
If we're going to look at what event happened during the last 3 months that potentially led to, and has led to, this underperformance, it's hard to ignore the August 11 announcement by Macy's that they were closing 100 department stores. Many of our investors have expressed concern over this.
I want to share with you our view about those store closures. First of all, it is healthy for any retailer to prudently prune their portfolio and to weed out unproductive business units and to focus their attention on their more productive business units. That's what we do as a company. Closing stores is a prudent thing, and a stronger Macy's makes for a stronger mall base. As I look at our exposure to Macy's and to these closures, it's our understanding that when those closures are announced, that we will have one store in our portfolio at that point in time that will be on the closure list, and we see the closure of that store to be a positive, not a negative. It's most likely going to be a West L.A. store, and it's a situation that is ready for redevelopment as we've discussed in previous calls.
As I think further about department stores and I think about the anxiety that people have about department stores, I also think about what has happened over the past 10 or 12 years with department stores. And one of the seminal events that happened in the department store industry was in 2005, when Macy's bought May Company, and that caused a significant consolidation within the department store business. The combination of that event and the general underperformance of department stores over the last 10 or 12 years have actually been arguably a positive for mall owners. And I know that seems strange for me to say that, but let me share with you the reason why.
With the consolidation of Macy's and May Company going back 11 years ago, many of the brands that really make up the excitement within a department store began to look at the balance of power that they had under negotiations with department stores and decided that they wanted to add another channel of distribution to their omnichannel approach. Albeit 11 years ago, I doubt that word is really used that much. But many of the great brands have relied predominantly on their distribution to be wholesale distribution through the department stores. And over a period of time, those brands have decided to open up full-price retail stores and, in many cases, flagship stores. And they comprise many of the best names that we have in the mall today. Names like Kiehl's, Michael Kors, Eileen Fisher, HUGO BOSS, Diane von Furstenberg, AllSaints, LOUIS VUITTON, Tory Burch, Ted Baker, Armani, M.A.C. Cosmetics, Burberry, True Religion, the list goes on. And we see that trend continuing, which is a trend that, as I have mentioned in the past, is a trend that you see generally in place in the global portfolios of other owners of shopping centers around the world.
So we see the store closures of Macy's to be a positive, not a negative. We see its impact on Macerich to be a positive, not a negative. And as I look at the overall health of the department store business, let's not lose sight of the fact that it was only 3 years ago that many folks that probably are on this call right now felt that JCPenney was doomed in terms of their future. And at that point in time, we were bit of an outlier where we said, ""Look, the one name that we see out there that we think is going to be in existence as a retailer 5 or 10 years after 2013 is going to be JCPenney."" And there's been much written about their turnaround. I can tell you that JCPenney stores look better than ever, and we're very happy with the new Penney store that we just opened in Inland Center.
Again, I feel your pain. I understand it, and -- but the fundamentals that we have here remain very strong.
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Here's the flip side though also. If Macy's had, like, ignored the idea of pruning their portfolio, I think the latter commentary should be why aren't they closing stores? So here they come out and they decide to be prudent and smart in running their business, and all of a sudden -- I understand it. Look, it came out of kind of left field for a lot of people. We kind of thought, ""Well, God, I thought Macy's was okay."" But it was -- it's good for their business, and what's good for them is good for us.

It has both sort of the traditional mall space as well as some street space. Generally, there's a pretty big distinction between what the retailers are trying to achieve on the street of these flagship locations or inside the mall. So they tend to be different decisions. And often, the real estate decision is controlled by different people within the retailer. So there's not really a situation where somebody says, ""I'm going to -- the street market is getting soft.

So we see next year being a fairly normal year. We're wrestling through the final aspects of some of the bankruptcies from this year.

I do think that the one store closure that we're anticipating fits exactly into that category that there's a higher and better use and a user that's willing to pay them a compelling number to convert their store to a higher and better use. And they've deemed it to -- they look at their overall representation and deemed that to be appropriate for them. And we see it as potentially an opportunity for us. As we look at the rest of the stores that we have with Macy's, there are opportunities in certain locations to repurpose either some of their square footage, downsize them or maybe even completely replace them with a higher and better use. We're in conversations with them. This is going to be, I think, a longer conversation. I wouldn't predict that there will be any announcements from us on this anytime soon, but I would predict there will be announcements that would fit the category of converting some of their square footage in a location or all of their square footage in a location to a higher and better use that should happen sometime in the future. I also would anticipate that there will be announcements in the future where we and Macy's have worked together to just make the overall environment more profitable, and that could involve something that could be a monetization for them, too."

It's a business decision that leads to cash revenue, so that's why we factored in. I think next year, what we will see in the first half of the year is we'll be going against very tough comps in the first and second quarter because we still have the comparative benefit in 2016 of the expense cuts.

The private markets views on our asset base have not changed. They -- if we were to go out today and talk about a similar pool of assets that we joint ventured, I would suspect that we'd be looking at a similar execution. But the discrepancy and the disparity and the percentage differential between the public market and the private market valuations of our company have arguably never been greater than they are today. So if that is true, it is a fact, and we'll keep a post on it. In the meantime, what we need to do is to continue to earn the appreciation for our portfolio by increasing the income and the valuation of each of our assets, which is what we're doing.

The third quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $1.04 per share, up from $1.01 in the third quarter of last year.
Same-center NOI increased by 4.2% compared to the third quarter of '15, which was a very tough comp quarter that was up 7%. This was positively impacted by $7.8 million of lease termination revenues in the third quarter. So in most cases, we were accelerating revenue we would have received in the fourth quarter and beyond into the third quarter.
Year-to-date, our same-center NOI growth is 6%. And as we discussed in our last earnings calls, most of the impact of the major tenant bankruptcies this year will be felt in the third and fourth quarter, which means lower same-center NOI growth in the third and fourth quarter than we saw in the first half of the year.
Our same-center estimate for NOI for the year, the range is being tightened to 4.5% to 4.75%. As we look forward into 2017, we're not giving full guidance for the year, but we are going to give some guidance on our expectation for same-center NOI growth. It will be down slightly from this year, and we expect the range of 3% to 4% same-center growth in 2017. Keep in mind that for the first half of 2016, we had the comparative benefit of the expense cuts that were initiated in the third quarter of '15. We will not have that comparative benefit as we compare 2017 to 2016.
Our gross operating margin on a same-center basis for the quarter improved to 69.6%. That was up from 68.5% in the third quarter of '15. And if we compare it to the third quarter of '14, 2 years ago, it's a 399 basis point improvement.
Year-to-date, the same-center gross margin was 69.33%, up from 67.9% during the same period of last year. Bad debt expense was a modest $300,000 for the quarter, down compared to $800,000 in the third quarter of last year.
As I mentioned previously, lease termination fees were $7.8 million for the quarter. That compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Most of these termination fees came from Sears at Kings Plaza, where we exercised our right to terminate their lease early. This had the effect of accelerating about $2.5 million of rent that would have been paid in the fourth quarter into the third.
During the third quarter, the average interest rate was 3.48%, up slightly from a year ago when it was 3.3%.
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter-end, our balance sheet metrics were healthy with debt-to-market cap at 37%, an interest coverage ratio of over 3.5x, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis of 7.2x, and the average debt maturity after the financing of Fresno Fashion Fair, which happened on October 6, is now over 6.5 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains good. A couple of examples. On October 6, we closed the $325 million loan on the previously unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. It was a CMBS loan, the first one we've done in a while, 10-year fixed-rate loan with an interest rate of 3.59%. The proceeds from that financing were used to pay down our line of credit, which subsequent to that paydown is approximately 100 -- or excuse me, $750 million outstanding.
Also on August 5, we closed on a $225 million loan on The Village at Corte Madera. That was a life insurance company loan. The term is 12 years and had a fixed interest rate of 3.5%.
I'm sure you saw in this morning's press release that we tightened our previous estimate of diluted FFO per share, and we narrowed the range to $4.05 to $4.10. That was down from $4.05 to $4.15. The revised FFO guidance comes primarily from reducing the midpoint of the range for the year on same-center NOI to 4.5% to 4.75%. That is down from our original guidance range of 4.5% to 5%.
The dilution from the sale of Capitola Mall, which was not included in the initial guidance, is offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt on Flagstaff, which also is not in the original guidance.
And now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

Leasing activity during the third quarter was consistent with the first half of the year, producing strong re-leasing spreads and stable occupancies.
Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 16.1%. This is unchanged from the second quarter. Leasing spreads were relatively consistent through all of the regions.
Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $56.52.
During the third quarter, a total of 803,000 square feet of leases were signed, down slightly from the previous quarter. The average term for leases signed in the third quarter increased to 7 years.
Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.3%. This represents a 30 basis point increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Portfolio sales were $626 per square foot, and on a same-center basis, sales were up 1.3% year-over-year.
I'm going to talk a minute about development. The third quarter represented an important milestone for the company as the developments at Broadway Plaza and Green Acres Commons celebrated their official grand openings. These 2 projects are illustrative of the company's strong development skills, taking unique retail locations and expanding their market dominance through densification. Combined, these 2 developments represented an investment of $263 million and will produce a blended stabilized return over 9%.
Over 10 years in the making, the expansion of Broadway Plaza began in 2012, when Neiman Marcus joined existing anchors Nordstrom and Macy's at the center. We are extremely pleased with the merchandise mix created at Broadway Plaza and, more importantly, the initial sales results from the tenants. The new space is 94% leased, and we anticipate all the retailers will be opened by this holiday season.
Green Acres Commons celebrated its grand opening on October 6. This 2-level power center, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, is a strong addition to the Green Acres retail campus and provides a home for many big-box retailers looking to tap this attractive New York market.
There were also a number of important anchor openings in the portfolio. These served to further increase the draw from these established retail centers.
At Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Nordstrom Rack opened its store on September 30. The center is now only 1 of 2 outlet venues in the U.S. that feature Nordstrom Rack, Saks OFF 5TH, Neiman's Last Call, Bloomingdale's outlet and Barney's as its anchors.
Dick's Sporting Goods opened a new store at The Oaks on October 11. In addition, 3 restaurants were added adjacent to Dick's. And finally, JCPenney had a very strong grand opening at Inland Center on October 21. The reception from the community was outstanding.
I'm going to take a minute to talk about tenant bankruptcies. There has been significant attention surrounding the health of certain specialty store tenants. You'll recall, we entered 2016 cautious in our expectations regarding tenant bankruptcy. During the third quarter, the 3 most prominent bankruptcies of 2016 were resolved, albeit in very different fashions. First, the bankruptcy of Sports Authority resulted in the liquidation of the entire chain. Almost all the stores were closed except for a small number of leases purchased by other retailers. Second, PacSun completed their restructuring with the major creditor maintaining control of the company. PacSun emerged from bankruptcy in September with a restructured balance sheet and most of its store fleet intact. Finally, Aeropostale will emerge under the control of a consortium of buyers. It is anticipated that up to 500 stores will be retained.
Most of the economic impact from these bankruptcies will be felt during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. As Art has discussed in the past, throughout the portfolio, our focus is to reduce the exposure to weaker, lower-productivity tenants well before they enter the restructuring process. For example, in 2012, Aeropostale had 45 stores in our portfolio. When they entered bankruptcy, this number had been reduced to 27. This was achieved through the disposition of lower-productivity centers, replace tenant [ph] lease expiration with more productive tenants, and early termination when the tenants still had the financial resources to pay termination fees. We expect our exposure with Aeropostale at the end of 2016 to be 19 store locations or approximately 78,000 square feet.
Looking forward, our leasing focus in the coming year will be to repurpose underproductive anchor department stores and replace the vacancy caused by recent tenant bankruptcies and early termination agreements. We believe opportunity exists in the anchor buildings by tapping demand from the big box and large-format specialty retailers. As discussed on the last earnings call, the opportunity to retenant the Sears box at Kings Plaza with retailers that include Primark and Zara represents a unique opportunity to move the center to the next level in terms of traffic, sales productivity and merchandise mix.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

Welcome to our call.As you can see from our numbers and our announcements, we had a very strong quarter.

As you can see from our numbers and our announcements, we had a very strong quarter. Our leasing spreads remained extremely strong, consistent with our belief that we have embedded growth within our portfolio. We culminated an 18-month period of improving operating margins and achieved our goal of improving our operating margins by 400 basis points. And as Bob pointed out, during the quarter, we successfully completed on-time, on-budget and at the returns that were expected the Green Acres expansion and the Broadway Plaza expansion.
The Broadway Plaza expansion is an important one to contemplate. Broadway Plaza recently celebrated its 75th year in business, 75 years. We bought Broadway Plaza about 31 years ago, and at the time, it had an NOI of $3 million. Upon stabilization, we anticipate that NOI to be roughly $40 million. So this is testimony that great real estate in the hands of great management with a well-capitalized balance sheet can succeed in spite of any challenges to the retail environment and any changes to the retail environment.
Our future we see to be very strong and bright. I am pleased, however, in the context of concerns over the retail environment, that at this point in time, with the completion of the Green Acres and the Broadway Plaza expansion, we have modest exposure in terms of our capital spend to a possible weak retail environment going forward over the near term. We only have Philadelphia and Kings Plaza in process, and both of those are proceeding as planned in terms of the merchandising and releasing.
Having said all of that, we feel the pain of our investors and those of you on this call that follow our company and our industry. Back on August 1, only a little less than 3 months ago, Macerich was trading at $91 a share and the RMZ was at $1,280. Today, we are roughly at $72 a share and the RMZ is down to $1,105. Malls as a sector are obviously down 500 to 600 basis points more than the other sectors that comprise the RMZ. It's the fundamentals about the mall business that has caused us to underperform? I would say from the viewpoint of our management that we see our fundamentals to be at least as strong today as they were 3 months ago, 6 months ago and 9 months ago. But it is hard to ignore the difference in terms of the performance of the sector.
If we're going to look at what event happened during the last 3 months that potentially led to, and has led to, this underperformance, it's hard to ignore the August 11 announcement by Macy's that they were closing 100 department stores. Many of our investors have expressed concern over this.
I want to share with you our view about those store closures. First of all, it is healthy for any retailer to prudently prune their portfolio and to weed out unproductive business units and to focus their attention on their more productive business units. That's what we do as a company. Closing stores is a prudent thing, and a stronger Macy's makes for a stronger mall base. As I look at our exposure to Macy's and to these closures, it's our understanding that when those closures are announced, that we will have one store in our portfolio at that point in time that will be on the closure list, and we see the closure of that store to be a positive, not a negative. It's most likely going to be a West L.A. store, and it's a situation that is ready for redevelopment, as we've discussed in previous calls.
As I think further about department stores and I think about the anxiety that people have about department stores, I also think about what has happened over the past 10 or 12 years with department stores. And one of the seminal events that happened in the department store industry was in 2005, when Macy's bought May Company, and that caused a significant consolidation within the department store business. The combination of that event and the general underperformance of department stores over the last 10 or 12 years has actually been arguably a positive for mall owners. And I know that seems strange for me to say that, but let me share with you the reason why.
With the consolidation of Macy's and May Company going back 11 years ago, many of the brands that really make up the excitement within a department store began to look at the balance of power that they had in their negotiations with department stores and decided that they wanted to add another channel of distribution to their omnichannel approach, albeit 11 years ago, I doubt that word was really used that much. But many of the great brands have relied predominantly on their distribution to be wholesale distribution through the department stores. And over a period of time, those brands have decided to open up full-price retail stores and, in many cases, flagship stores. And they comprise many of the best names that we have in the mall today. Names like Kiehl's, Michael Kors, Eileen Fisher, HUGO BOSS, Diane von Furstenberg, AllSaints, LOUIS VUITTON, Tory Burch, Ted Baker, Armani, M.A.C. Cosmetics, Burberry, True Religion, the list goes on. And we see that trend continuing, which is a trend that -- as I have mentioned in the past, is a trend that you see generally in place in the global portfolios of other owners of shopping centers around the world.
So we see the store closures of Macy's to be a positive, not a negative. We see its impact on Macerich to be a positive, not a negative. And as I look at the overall health of the department store business, let's not lose sight of the fact that it was only 3 years ago that many folks that probably are on this call right now felt that JCPenney was doomed in terms of their future. And at that point in time, we were a bit of an outlier where we said, ""Look, the one name that we see out there that we think is going to be in existence as a retailer 5 or 10 years after 2013 is going to be JCPenney."" And there's been much written about their turnaround. I can tell you that JCPenney stores look better than ever, and we're very happy with the new Penney store that we just opened in Inland Center.
Again, I feel your pain. I understand it, and -- but the fundamentals that we have here remain very strong.
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

It's not surprising that Macerich, which has been extremely diligent in pruning our portfolio, has even less exposure than you would expect. So we see -- look, we see it as healthy for Macy's. Here's the flip side though also. If Macy's had, like, ignored the idea of pruning their portfolio, I think the louder commentary should be why aren't they closing stores? So here they come out and they decide to be prudent and smart in running their business, and all of a sudden -- I understand it. Look, it came out of kind of left field for a lot of people. We kind of thought, ""Well, God, I thought Macy's was okay."" But it was -- it's good for their business, and what's good for them is good for us. And whether it be Macy's or any other anchor that we have in the portfolio that we own, we see it as opportunities generally. We see the opportunities to replace them with other uses that draw traffic and that do the job of what an anchor is supposed to do. So from my viewpoint, I don't see that's a negative at all."

It has both sort of the traditional mall space as well as some street space. Generally, there's a pretty big distinction between what the retailers are trying to achieve on the street of these flagship locations or inside the mall. So they tend to be different decisions. And often, the real estate decision is controlled by different people within the retailer. So there's not really a situation where somebody says, ""I'm going to -- the street market is getting soft. I'm going to put more resources into the mall,"" or vice versa. They're really, in our mind, 2 independent decisions."

So we see next year being a fairly normal year. We're wrestling through the final aspects of some of the bankruptcies from this year.

The third quarter reflected continued strong operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolio's key operating metrics. For the quarter, FFO was $1.04 per share, up from $1.01 in the third quarter of last year.
Same-center NOI increased by 4.2% compared to the third quarter of '15, which was a very tough comp quarter that was up 7%. This was positively impacted by $7.8 million of lease termination revenues in the third quarter. So in most cases, we were accelerating revenue we would have received in the fourth quarter and beyond into the third quarter.
Year-to-date, our same-center NOI growth is 6%. And as we discussed in our last earnings calls, most of the impact of the major tenant bankruptcies this year will be felt in the third and fourth quarter, which means lower same-center NOI growth in the third and fourth quarter than we saw in the first half of the year.
Our same-center estimate for NOI for the year, the range is being tightened to 4.5% to 4.75%. As we look forward into 2017, we're not giving full guidance for the year, but we are going to give some guidance on our expectation for same-center NOI growth. It will be down slightly from this year, and we expect the range of 3% to 4% same-center growth in 2017. Keep in mind that for the first half of 2016, we had the comparative benefit of the expense cuts that were initiated in the third quarter of '15. We will not have that comparative benefit as we compare 2017 to 2016.
Our gross operating margin on a same-center basis for the quarter improved to 69.6%. That was up from 68.5% in the third quarter of '15. And if we compare it to the third quarter of '14, 2 years ago, it's a 399 basis point improvement.
Year-to-date, the same-center gross margin was 69.33%, up from 67.9% during the same period of last year. Bad debt expense was a modest $300,000 for the quarter, down compared to $800,000 in the third quarter of last year.
As I mentioned previously, lease termination fees were $7.8 million for the quarter. That compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Most of these termination fees came from Sears at Kings Plaza, where we exercised our right to terminate their lease early. This had the effect of accelerating about $2.5 million of rent that would have been paid in the fourth quarter into the third.
During the third quarter, the average interest rate was 3.48%, up slightly from a year ago when it was 3.3%.
The balance sheet continues to be in great shape. At quarter end, our balance sheet metrics were healthy with debt-to-market cap at 37%, an interest coverage ratio of over 3.5x, debt-to-EBITDA on a forward basis of 7.2x, and the average debt maturity after the financing of Fresno Fashion Fair, which happened on October 6, is now over 6.5 years.
The financing market for high-quality regional malls remains good. A couple of examples. On October 6, we closed the $325 million loan on the previously unencumbered Fresno Fashion Fair. It was a CMBS loan, the first one we've done in a while, 10-year fixed-rate loan with an interest rate of 3.59%. The proceeds from that financing were used to pay down our line of credit, which subsequent to that paydown is approximately 100 -- or excuse me, $750 million outstanding.
Also on August 5, we closed on a $225 million loan on The Village at Corte Madera. That was a life insurance company loan. The term is 12 years and had a fixed interest rate of 3.5%.
I'm sure you saw in this morning's press release that we tightened our previous estimate of diluted FFO per share, and we narrowed the range to $4.05 to $4.10. That was down from $4.05 to $4.15. The revised FFO guidance comes primarily from reducing the midpoint of the range for the year on same-center NOI to 4.5% to 4.75%. That is down from our original guidance range of 4.5% to 5%.
The dilution from the sale of Capitola Mall, which was not included in the initial guidance, is offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt on Flagstaff, which also is not in the original guidance.
And now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to discuss the tenant environment."

Leasing activity during the third quarter was consistent with the first half of the year, producing strong re-leasing spreads and stable occupancies.
Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 16.1%. This is unchanged from the second quarter. Leasing spreads were relatively consistent through all of the regions.
Average rent for leases signed during the trailing 12-month period was $56.52.
During the third quarter, a total of 803,000 square feet of leases were signed, down slightly from the previous quarter. The average term for leases signed in the third quarter increased to 7 years.
Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.3%. This represents a 30 basis point increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Portfolio sales were $626 per square foot, and on a same-center basis, sales were up 1.3% year-over-year.
I'm going to talk a minute about development. The third quarter represented an important milestone for the company as the developments at Broadway Plaza and Green Acres Commons celebrated their official grand openings. These 2 projects are illustrative of the company's strong development skills, taking unique retail locations and expanding their market dominance through densification. Combined, these 2 developments represented an investment of $263 million and will produce a blended stabilized return over 9%.
Over 10 years in the making, the expansion of Broadway Plaza began in 2012, when Neiman Marcus joined existing anchors Nordstrom and Macy's at the center. We are extremely pleased with the merchandise mix created at Broadway Plaza and, more importantly, the initial sales results from the tenants. The new space is 94% leased, and we anticipate all the retailers will be opened by this holiday season.
Green Acres Commons celebrated its grand opening on October 6. This 2-level power center, anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, is a strong addition to the Green Acres retail campus and provides a home for many big-box retailers looking to tap this attractive New York market.
There were also a number of important anchor openings in the portfolio. These served to further increase the draw from these established retail centers.
At Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Nordstrom Rack opened its store on September 30. The center is now only 1 of 2 outlet venues in the U.S. that feature Nordstrom Rack, Saks OFF 5TH, Neiman's Last Call, Bloomingdale's outlet and Barney's as its anchors.
Dick's Sporting Goods opened a new store at The Oaks on October 11. In addition, 3 restaurants were added adjacent to Dick's. And finally, JCPenney had a very strong grand opening at Inland Center on October 21. The reception from the community was outstanding.
I'm going to take a minute to talk about tenant bankruptcies. There has been significant attention surrounding the health of certain specialty store tenants. You'll recall, we entered 2016 cautious in our expectations regarding tenant bankruptcy. During the third quarter, the 3 most prominent bankruptcies of 2016 were resolved, albeit in very different fashions. First, the bankruptcy of Sports Authority resulted in the liquidation of the entire chain. Almost all the stores were closed except for a small number of leases purchased by other retailers. Second, PacSun completed their restructuring with the major creditor maintaining control of the company. PacSun emerged from bankruptcy in September with a restructured balance sheet and most of its store fleet intact. Finally, Aeropostale will emerge under the control of a consortium of buyers. It is anticipated that up to 500 stores will be retained.
Most of the economic impact from these bankruptcies will be felt during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. As Art has discussed in the past, throughout the portfolio, our focus is to reduce the exposure to weaker, lower-productivity tenants well before they enter the restructuring process. For example, in 2012, Aeropostale had 45 stores in our portfolio. When they entered bankruptcy, this number had been reduced to 27. This was achieved through the disposition of lower-productivity centers, replace tenant [ph] lease expiration with more productive tenants, and early termination when the tenants still had the financial resources to pay termination fees. We expect our exposure with Aeropostale at the end of 2016 to be 19 store locations or approximately 78,000 square feet.
Looking forward, our leasing focus in the coming year will be to repurpose underproductive anchor department stores and replace the vacancy caused by recent tenant bankruptcies and early termination agreements. We believe opportunity exists in the anchor buildings by tapping demand from the big box and large-format specialty retailers. As discussed on the last earnings call, the opportunity to retenant the Sears box at Kings Plaza with retailers that include Primark and Zara represents a unique opportunity to move the center to the next level in terms of traffic, sales productivity and merchandise mix.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Art."

As you can see from our numbers and our announcements, we had a very strong quarter. Our leasing spreads remained extremely strong, consistent with our belief that we have embedded growth within our portfolio. We culminated an 18-month period of improving operating margins and achieved our goal of improving our operating margins by 400 basis points. And as Bob pointed out, during the quarter, we successfully completed on-time, on-budget and at the returns that were expected the Green Acres expansion and the Broadway Plaza expansion.
The Broadway Plaza expansion is an important one to contemplate. Broadway Plaza recently celebrated its 75th year in business, 75 years. We bought Broadway Plaza about 31 years ago, and at the time, it had an NOI of $3 million. Upon stabilization, we anticipate that NOI to be roughly $40 million. So this is testimony that great real estate in the hands of great management with a well-capitalized balance sheet can succeed in spite of any challenges to the retail environment and any changes to the retail environment.
Our future we see to be very strong and bright. I am pleased, however, in the context of concerns over the retail environment, that at this point in time, with the completion of the Green Acres and the Broadway Plaza expansion, we have modest exposure in terms of our capital spend to a possible weak retail environment going forward over the near term. We only have Philadelphia and Kings Plaza in process, and both of those are proceeding as planned in terms of the merchandising and releasing.
Having said all of that, we feel the pain of our investors and those of you on this call that follow our company and our industry. Back on August 1, only a little less than 3 months ago, Macerich was trading at $91 a share and the RMZ was at $1,280. Today, we are roughly at $72 a share and the RMZ is down to $1,105. Malls as a sector are obviously down 500 to 600 basis points more than the other sectors that comprise the RMZ. It's the fundamentals about the mall business that has caused us to underperform? I would say from the viewpoint of our management that we see our fundamentals to be at least as strong today as they were 3 months ago, 6 months ago and 9 months ago. But it is hard to ignore the difference in terms of the performance of the sector.
If we're going to look at what event happened during the last 3 months that potentially led to, and has led to, this underperformance, it's hard to ignore the August 11 announcement by Macy's that they were closing 100 department stores. Many of our investors have expressed concern over this.
I want to share with you our view about those store closures. First of all, it is healthy for any retailer to prudently prune their portfolio and to weed out unproductive business units and to focus their attention on their more productive business units. That's what we do as a company. Closing stores is a prudent thing, and a stronger Macy's makes for a stronger mall base. As I look at our exposure to Macy's and to these closures, it's our understanding that when those closures are announced, that we will have one store in our portfolio at that point in time that will be on the closure list, and we see the closure of that store to be a positive, not a negative. It's most likely going to be a West L.A. store, and it's a situation that is ready for redevelopment, as we've discussed in previous calls.
As I think further about department stores and I think about the anxiety that people have about department stores, I also think about what has happened over the past 10 or 12 years with department stores. And one of the seminal events that happened in the department store industry was in 2005, when Macy's bought May Company, and that caused a significant consolidation within the department store business. The combination of that event and the general underperformance of department stores over the last 10 or 12 years has actually been arguably a positive for mall owners. And I know that seems strange for me to say that, but let me share with you the reason why.
With the consolidation of Macy's and May Company going back 11 years ago, many of the brands that really make up the excitement within a department store began to look at the balance of power that they had in their negotiations with department stores and decided that they wanted to add another channel of distribution to their omnichannel approach, albeit 11 years ago, I doubt that word was really used that much. But many of the great brands have relied predominantly on their distribution to be wholesale distribution through the department stores. And over a period of time, those brands have decided to open up full-price retail stores and, in many cases, flagship stores. And they comprise many of the best names that we have in the mall today. Names like Kiehl's, Michael Kors, Eileen Fisher, HUGO BOSS, Diane von Furstenberg, AllSaints, LOUIS VUITTON, Tory Burch, Ted Baker, Armani, M.A.C. Cosmetics, Burberry, True Religion, the list goes on. And we see that trend continuing, which is a trend that -- as I have mentioned in the past, is a trend that you see generally in place in the global portfolios of other owners of shopping centers around the world.
So we see the store closures of Macy's to be a positive, not a negative. We see its impact on Macerich to be a positive, not a negative. And as I look at the overall health of the department store business, let's not lose sight of the fact that it was only 3 years ago that many folks that probably are on this call right now felt that JCPenney was doomed in terms of their future. And at that point in time, we were a bit of an outlier where we said, ""Look, the one name that we see out there that we think is going to be in existence as a retailer 5 or 10 years after 2013 is going to be JCPenney."" And there's been much written about their turnaround. I can tell you that JCPenney stores look better than ever, and we're very happy with the new Penney store that we just opened in Inland Center.
Again, I feel your pain. I understand it, and -- but the fundamentals that we have here remain very strong.
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

So realizing that those may be 2 different pools, but just wondering why with that sort of strength in spread, you're not seeing more flow through into ABR. Has that been impacted by the rent release at all?

I think we already talked about this earlier in the call, but there's really 2 things. We sold Capitola, which happened in the second quarter. Obviously, we knew about that, but we are not about to knee-jerk react and change guidance just for that one item because we're also in negotiations with the loan servicer on Flagstaff for that asset to go back. And we knew when that ultimately happened and title was transferred, we'd recognize a gain, and those are 2 roughly offsetting. So it certainly didn't warrant us changing guidance down for Capitola and then turning around the next quarter and moving it up for Flagstaff. So those 2 netted out."

And in Chicago, you have 500 North Michigan that's on the avenue as well as in line. Have you noticed a change in the way that retailers as you talk to them, as they're viewing their street retail presence versus the mall presence? My point is do the retailers think of those in concert? Or do they think of each as different, and the street retail is a different leasing decision than the mall retail? Or within a certain metro or submarket, they view it together, and it's just basically where they think they can get more traffic?"

Kings and Queens really don't compete with the street retail in Manhattan or New York. It's a more traditional mall mix, and their strength really comes from the density of the population and the lack of alternatives for these retailers. North Bridge has a little bit of both. It has both sort of the traditional mall space as well as some street space. Generally, there's a pretty big distinction between what the retailers are trying to achieve on the street of these flagship locations or inside the mall. So they tend to be different decisions. And often, the real estate decision is controlled by different people within the retailer. So there's not really a situation where somebody says, ""I'm going to -- the street market is getting soft. I'm going to put more resources into the mall,"" or vice versa. They're really, in our mind, 2 independent decisions."

Normally, it would have been in the fourth, which is fairly sizeable. That was about $3 million in rent that got moved. Also, we're going against very tough comps in the third and fourth quarter because we had the benefit of the expense cuts in the third and fourth quarter on a comp basis last year compared to this year, and that won't be recurring. So we see next year being a fairly normal year. We're wrestling through the final aspects of some of the bankruptcies from this year. But really, our same-center growth is driven by rent increases, which in general tend to be 2.5% to 3% in a given year. And generally, we look at these things on an occupancy-neutral basis.

We're in conversations with them. This is going to be, I think, a longer conversation. I wouldn't predict that there will be any announcements from us on this anytime soon, but I would predict there will be announcements that would fit the category of converting some of their square footage in a location or all of their square footage in a location to a higher and better use.

I think we're extremely well positioned, Michael, for the near and long term. And we're open to all ideas at all times. But the idea of trading in our stock is not something that we would find to be appealing at this point in time."

They can trade by the second. The private market investors, maybe you can share some of those conversations or whether they've expressed similar concerns about the fundamentals, how they perceive asset values. Because if you're not going to buy your stock, you certainly have the opportunity, which you've done currently with Heitman, with GIC, to sell interest in assets to modify and arb the public versus private market disconnect. Or maybe they're as concerned as the public market. I'm just trying to get a sense of where that sits."

We think we have an extremely good pulse on the private market view on our portfolio, our sector and our company and, in particular, our properties. And we felt that it was important a year ago to monetize that view and to show to the rest -- to all of you that, that was the way that we saw that the private markets valued our assets. And we felt at the time that there was a significant disconnect between the private market views on our company and the public market views. The private market's views on our asset base have not changed. They -- if we were to go out today and talk about a similar pool of assets that we joint ventured, I would suspect that we'd be looking at a similar execution. But the discrepancy and the disparity and the percentage differential between the public market and the private market valuations of our company have arguably never been greater than they are today. So if that is true, it is a fact, and we'll keep a pulse on it. In the meantime, what we need to do is to continue to earn the appreciation for our portfolio by increasing the income and the valuation of each of our assets, which is what we're doing. But the private market/public market disparity has probably -- I can't remember when it's been greater, but it's certainly -- it's very high today and much higher than it was a year ago."

And I guess part of the hesitation of selling more joint venture interest is you're encouraged by the potential growth and value as you invest in your assets. And while you could arb some of that spread today by selling your 50% interest, take Queens or Kings or do something there, you lose that potential upside in terms of growth. And so you have this -- I guess your optionality or your options are a little bit more limited to narrow that spread. Does that make sense?"
