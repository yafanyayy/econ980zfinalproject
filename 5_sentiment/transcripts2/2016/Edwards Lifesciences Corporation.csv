We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year, both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total",1690,"Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year, both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total global sales of $2.5 billion, representing an underlying growth rate of 17%, which is higher than we predicted a year ago. And just recently, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our PARTNER 3 trial to study patients determined to be at low surgical risk, which may eventually enable heart teams to offer a choice of therapies to a broader group of patients. 
For the quarter, total underlying sales grew to $267 million, an increase of 15%. Results were driven by robust demand for TAVR therapy and the strong performance of all product lines this quarter. 
In transcatheter heart valves, full year global sales were $1.2 billion, up 38% over the prior year on an underlying basis. We exceeded our original estimate of 15% to 25% provided a year ago, primarily due to the earlier approval of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and the more rapid than expected therapy adoption in Europe. 
For the fourth quarter, underlying global sales were up 32% over last year led by the impact of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and double-digit underlying sales growth across all regions. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 
In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter grew 50% [ph] versus the prior year to $189 million. Our performance was driven by procedure growth, which was unexpectedly strong during the holiday season and has not been our typical experience. We estimate that Edwards growth was similar to the overall procedure growth. 
Nearly all of our existing accounts are now using our SAPIEN 3 valve. Growth was primarily driven by large hospitals and new site training continued during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with approximately 400 active centers. Our recently introduced 20-millimeter SAPIEN 3 valve was also a contributor. We believe the strong growth and adoption of TAVR in the U.S. was driven by the growing body of clinical evidence, increased physician experience and high procedural success. Many hospitals are responding to the increased demand by modifying their schedules to perform more procedures each week. We see this trend continuing as TAVR provides an attractive therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. We expect these patients will be encouraged to seek treatments as indications expand, which is the primary driver behind our belief that the global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion in 2021. 
Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew double digits in all regions aided by the continued rollout of SAPIEN XT in Japan. We estimate our OUS growth was roughly in line with overall therapy adoption. 
In Europe, we estimate the therapy adoption grew more than 20% and our sales growth was somewhat lower. Our sales growth was primarily lifted by the continued adoption of SAPIEN 3. We estimate that more recent competitors continue to account for approximately 15% of total procedures. 
We saw strong growth across most countries and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region with other countries growing faster than Germany for the past couple of quarters. Generally, reimbursement trends remain stable, allowing for continued growth and adoption. 
In 2016, expanding the indication to treat intermediate-risk patients remains a key focus. We expect data from the intermediate risk cohorts in 2 studies to be presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in April, our randomized study of SAPIEN XT versus surgery and the study of SAPIEN 3. As we indicated at our investor conference, assuming positive results and an expedited FDA review, we're planning for a late 2016 U.S. approval and a minimal contribution to sales this year. We expect our Continued Access Program for intermediate-risk patients in the U.S. to continue until commercial approval. We plan to use the U.S. data in a CE Mark submission in Europe. 
And as I mentioned earlier, we received FDA approval to study an expanded indication for the SAPIEN 3 valve. The IDE study will enroll elderly patients at least 65 years of age with the severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, who have been determined by a heart team to be at low risk for mortality if they were to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement. The PARTNER 3 trial will enroll approximately 1,300 patients in up to 50 [ph] sites, and we're working now to secure IRB and contract approvals at those hospitals. Enrollment is expected to continue into 2017. And while we believe this procedure will be attractive to low-risk patients, randomized trials typically take longer to enroll. The SAPIEN 3 trial will also include a 400-patient substudy using advanced imaging to evaluate leaflet motion in surgical in transcatheter tissue valves. We're looking forward to introducing our SAPIEN 3 ultra system, which is on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter this year. This new system featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheet technology is expected to enhance ease of use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time. 
We also remain on track with our efforts to add the pulmonic indication to our SAPIEN family of valves. During the first quarter, we expect to receive approval and launch SAPIEN XT for this indication and then begin enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the SAPIEN 3 in Q2. 
In summary, based on our momentum and the expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 THV global sales estimate by $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth in 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 25%. 
Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Full year 2015 global sales were $785 million, up 2.5% on an underlying basis over the prior year and consistent with our original guidance of 1% to 3%. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales growth was lifted by a higher surgical heart valve unit, but was lowered by the planned exit of nonstrategic products. 
Sales of our premium products contributed to solid heart valve performance across all major regions led by procedural volume and share gains. Surgical heart valve units grew approximately 5% and global average selling pricing declined slightly due to country mix. 
During the fourth quarter, we submitted the PMA in support of the FDA approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve. We still expect the launch in the U.S. mid-2016. 
In Germany, adopters of our INTUITY Elite valve will now benefit from a new higher DRG for combined procedures. We believe this will support greater adoption of our rapid deployment valve for patients, who suffer from the combination of aortic stenosis and coronary disease, a common occurrence. 
Notably, a recent paper published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery concluded that our PERIMOUNT Magma family of valves demonstrated excellent long-term durability and hydrodynamic performance after accelerated in vitro testing equivalent to 25 years of heartbeats. All valve studies successfully endured 1 billion cycles, which is 5x longer than the standard testing requirement for a tissue valves. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued strength of our premium surgical valve products and are preparing for new product launches 2016. We continue to focus on improving therapy options for younger patients, streamlining complex surgeries and enabling minimally invasive procedures. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6%. 
In the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $141 million and grew 4% on an underlying basis. Total sales for 2015 were $528 million, up 3% over the prior year on an underlying basis, consistent with our original guidance of 2% to 4%. Global growth for the quarter was driven primarily by core hemodynamic monitoring products in the U.S. and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which recorded double-digit underlying growth across most regions. 
We are focused on strengthening our core offerings by strengthening our gold standard products, including a next-generation monitor. We are expanding our sales force in the U.S. to broaden the adoption of our market-leading products. And in Japan, we are expecting a contribution to growth and the launch of ClearSight, our noninvasive monitoring technology. Overall, we're pleased with the continuing adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products. We continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016. 
As we highlighted at our investor conference, we're investing in a number of structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress at our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve program or TMVR and our pharma system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation. Early U.S. feasibility studies with both of these technologies are currently underway. Additionally, we're continuing to closely follow our investments in the harpoon cortal repair and the CardioKinetix heart failure therapies as they gain clinical experience. While all of these technologies are substantial opportunities, they do involve significant challenges and are in their early stages. 
Providing some more detail on our TMVR program, we've begun treating patients at our U.S. early feasibility studies planned for 7 sites. Our learnings from these cases will inform our CE Mark trial, which is expected to begin in mid-2016. Our mitral team is currently working on enhancements to the CardiAQ Edwards valve platform, including additional sizes, delivery system refinements and the addition of Edwards' clinically proven bovine pericardial tissue. We're also currently developing additional next-generation TMVR products that leverage our experience. We're optimistic about the future of TMVR technology, and although commercialization time lines are still unclear, we continue to believe that TMVR will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease, who aren't well served today. 
And finally, in regards to the recently implemented 2-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax, we are evaluating a number of meaningful opportunities to accelerate existing growth programs or initiate new ones, and as such, we expect a minimal positive impact to 2016 earnings. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion",873,"Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion. Our gross profit margin was 75.2% and free cash flow was $447 million. In the fourth quarter, another strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove our topline to an overall 15% underlying sales growth rate. Unusually strong U.S. THV sales during the holiday season lifted performance above our expectations. The strong U.S. dollar continue to have a significant negative impact on reported sales, which grew 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63, representing 19% growth over the prior year. Total underlying sales in the fourth quarter were $667 [ph] million. This excludes the $4 million benefit of the THV sales return reserve as we substantially completed the SAPIEN 3 product exchange in the United States. 
I'll now cover the details behind our results and then share guidance for 2016. For the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.8% compared to 74.0% in the same period of 2014. We expected fourth quarter gross profit to be approximately 75% based on a more profitable product mix and a positive impact of foreign exchange hedge contracts. Our actual result was below our expectation because we elected to realign some Critical Care manufacturing operations to improve our cost structure. We continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 75% in 2016. 
Turning to SG&A. Fourth quarter expenses were $222 million or 33.1% of sales compared to $223 million in the prior year. The modest decrease was driven by the favorable foreign exchange impact in our expenses outside the United States, largely offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves. Given our increased THV sales estimates, we now expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year 2016, which is an improvement over our investor conference guidance. 
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 17% to $98 million or 14.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect research and development as a percentage of sales to be approximately 16%. We are evaluating the opportunities to reinvest the savings from the 2-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax. We are deploying a disciplined process to explore value-creating opportunities to accelerate existing programs or initiate new ones. 
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 16%, which benefited from the renewal of the federal research and development tax credit. Given the expected stronger sales of THV in the U.S., we now expect our full year 2016 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. And in light of recent legislation making the R&D tax credit permanent, we expect our rate to be relatively consistent across borders. 
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million compared to the prior year driven by the weakening of the euro and yen. Compared to our October guidance, foreign exchange rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.01. At current rates, we continue to estimate a $55 million negative impact to full year 2016 sales. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $104 million and included a $33 million tax payment related to a previously reported litigation settlement. After capital spending of $37.5 million, free cash flow was $66.3 million. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion. Total debt was $600 million. During the full year 2015, we repurchased approximately $3.9 million split-adjusted shares for $280 million. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance, all of which assumes current foreign exchange rates. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, due to our strong momentum and expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are raising our 2016 guidance provided on our December investor conference to between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves therapies of $780 million to $820 million; for Critical Care of $510 million to $515 [ph] million; and now expect total sales of $2.6 billion to $2.85 billion. Primarily as the result of increased excavations for sales, we are raising adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $2.57 and $2.67; free cash flow to $475 million to $525 million. The suspension of the medical device tax is expected to have minimal impact on 2016 earnings per share. We continue to expect shares outstanding in the range of 216 million to 220 million, which reflects our plan to repurchase shares during 2016. As we explained in our investor conference, adjusted earnings per share now excludes intangible amortization expense and prior period comparisons are available on our website.  For the first quarter 2016, at current FX rates, we project total sales to be between $640 million and $680 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.70. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

I wonder if you could just walk us through, again, the logic path of walking the label to SAPIEN 3? Obviously, that's the commercial bet you're making, but you're going to be mixing, getting from both the XT valve and also the SAPIEN 3 valve. And that's question #1. Question #2 is as we've been talking to physicians, there's an expectation for noninferiority versus surgery.

There are going to be 2 data sets that are substantial that are presented at the ACC. The original PARTNER II trial is a randomization of SAPIEN XT versus open heart valve replacement, so you'll see the results of that. That's a substantial study, and again, high-quality science. Within the contemporary time frame, we were able to introduce SAPIEN 3. And so literally added to the PARTNER II trial was this separate arm of 1,000 SAPIEN 3 patients that were also enrolled in intermediate patients. And the thought here is it's a comparison of SAPIEN 3 that you will be able to compare to both the SAPIEN XT data and also the surgical data, because it was all done in a contemporary time frame. And since the SAPIEN 3 valve is the valve that's probably in use today, I think the logic will hold together and we're expecting that physicians and FDA will see it that way. So that's sort of point #1. Point #2, the way the trial was constructed, it was a noninferiority trial and we really powered it for noninferiority. We're still a very large trial to power a trial for superiority. We would assume that the time would've taken a lot of patients, so we're still assuming that we are favorable on noninferiority. It's always possible that somebody can do a post-hoc analysis of the data and try and analyze whether it's superior, but it will be trying to do it with a number of patients that was really intended for -- to demonstrate noninferiority."

But the drop through is obviously much more dramatic than what we've seen in the past. In fact, Scott, if you do the back envelope numbers and just took the midpoint of the prior sales range, the midpoint of the prior SG&A guidance and the midpoint of the new sales range, the new SG&A guidance actually implies it would be incremental $100 million in sales that SG&A is actually down slightly despite the incremental sales numbers.

These are tough to anticipate in advance just exactly how many centers are going to be into it. And what we find here is with the success of TAVR, and actually, it appears to be a really learnable procedure, that centers are sincerely interested in having this option to offer to their patient. Just think if you're a center that only offers a surgical option, you're not quite as attractive as you might be if you had a full range of options. So this is encouraging centers to come into it. In terms of how many, we do have somewhat of a backlog. It would be a real guess at this point, but maybe an additional 40 sites in 2016 might be added. Some of these sites, if we're successful in getting a pulmonic indication, might be pediatric sites that come in and learn TAVR as well. So it's an estimate, Jason, and hopefully, that helps you a little bit. In terms of what's going on over the holiday season, I suspect you're right. The shorter length of stays probably encouraged people to maybe take something on over the holidays that they might not have taken on if they had a long recovery period. We didn't anticipate it, so I can't tell you we had this all figured out in advance. This is more we watch the story and now we're applying our explanations to why, but we probably have critical little deeper to understand. But again, I'll just remind on the bigger picture in terms of number of centers, we continue to see the large bulk of the growth come from these big hospitals that already have strong programs."

Because these procedures turn out to be shorter and more predictable, what it's done is it encouraged hospitals. So within the same Cath Lab or within the same OR, they can get more cases per day. And also some hospitals are looking at this, I think, relative to the demand out there and also their own economics, and they're just added extra days. So maybe in the past, they used to do these days is only on Tuesday, and now they might happen in multiple days per week in that same hospital. So for the most part, it's not, if you will, bricks-and-mortar that's driving the capacity increase. I think it's more a redistribution of their own internal capacity combined with just improving efficiency of these procedures."

That part of what the FDA label calls for and also what the CMS NCD calls for. And so risk scores are helpful, but they are not the only indicators that are used by clinicians. That will include frailties, other factors like a hospital et cetera, when they go through their assessment.

We're -- we typically try and support organizations like the ACC and the American Heart Association and individual hospitals as they raise awareness, but we wouldn't expect anything unusual beyond that. In terms of OUS and what is going to be their policies, it's probably going to be driven primarily by how they approach it from the reimbursement perspective. And so we're what going to be prepared to do as part of our low-risk trial is to also gather information on economics, gather information on the quality of life for these patients so that we can have a meaningful conversation with these payers around the world.

411220,321992671,925031,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total g",1683,"Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total global sales of $2.5 billion, representing an underlying growth rate of 17%, which is higher than we predicted a year ago. And just recently, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our PARTNER III trial to study patients determined to be at low surgical risk, which may eventually enable heart teams to offer choice of therapies to a broader group of patients. 
For the quarter, total underlying sales grew to $267 million, an increase of 15%. Results were driven by robust demand for TAVR therapy and the strong performance of all product lines this quarter. 
In transcatheter heart valves, full year global sales were $1.2 billion, up 38% over the prior year on an underlying basis. We exceeded our original estimate of 15% to 25% provided a year ago, primarily due to the early approval of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and the more rapid than expected therapy adoption in Europe. 
For the fourth quarter, underlying global sales were up 32% over last year led by the impact of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and double-digit underlying sales growth across all regions. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 
In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter grew 50% versus the prior year to $189 million. Our performance was driven by procedure growth, which was unexpectedly strong during the holiday season and has not been our typical experience. We estimate that Edwards' growth was similar to the overall procedure growth. 
Nearly all of our existing accounts are now using our SAPIEN 3 valve. Growth was primarily driven by large hospitals and new site training continued during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with approximately 400 active centers. Our recently introduced 20-millimeter SAPIEN 3 valve was also a contributor. We believe the strong growth and adoption of TAVR in the U.S. was driven by the growing body of clinical evidence, increased physician experience and high procedural success. Many hospitals are responding to the increased demand by modifying their schedules to perform more procedures each week. We see this trend continuing as TAVR provides an attractive therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. We expect these patients will be encouraged to seek treatment as indications expand, which is the primary driver behind our belief that the global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion in 2021. 
Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew double digits in all regions aided by the continued rollout of SAPIEN XT in Japan. We estimate our OUS growth was roughly in line with overall therapy adoption. 
In Europe, we estimate that therapy adoption grew more than 20%, and our sales growth was somewhat lower. Our sales growth was primarily lifted by the continued adoption of SAPIEN 3. We estimate that more recent competitors continue to account for approximately 15% of total procedures. 
We saw strong growth across most countries and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region, with other countries growing faster than Germany for the past couple of quarters. Generally, reimbursement trends remain stable, allowing for continued growth and adoption. 
In 2016, expanding the indication to treat intermediate-risk patients remains a key focus. We expect data from the intermediate risk cohorts in 2 studies to be presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in April, our randomized study of SAPIEN XT versus surgery and the study of SAPIEN 3. As we indicated at our investor conference, assuming positive results and an expedited FDA review, we're planning for a late 2016 U.S. approval and a minimal contribution to sales this year. We expect our Continued Access Program for intermediate-risk patients in the U.S. to continue until commercial approval. We plan to use the U.S. data in a CE Mark submission in Europe. 
And as I mentioned earlier, we received FDA approval to study an expanded indication for the SAPIEN 3 valve. The IDE study will enroll elderly patients at least 65 years of age with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, who've been determined by a heart team to be at low risk for mortality if they were to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement. The PARTNER III trial will enroll approximately 1,300 patients in up to 50 sites, and we're working now to secure IRB and contract approvals at those hospitals. Enrollment is expected to continue into 2017. And while we believe this procedure will be attractive to low-risk patients, randomized trials typically take longer to enroll. The SAPIEN 3 trial will also include a 400-patient sub-study using advanced imaging to evaluate leaflet motion in surgical and transcatheter tissue valves. We're looking forward to introducing our SAPIEN 3 ultra system, which is on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter this year. This new system featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheet technology is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time. 
We also remain on track with our efforts to add the pulmonic indication to our SAPIEN family of valves. During the first quarter, we expect to receive approval and launch SAPIEN XT for this indication and then begin enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the SAPIEN 3 in Q2. 
In summary, based on our momentum and the expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 THV global sales estimate by $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth in 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 25%. 
Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Full year 2015 global sales were $785 million, up 2.5% on an underlying basis over the prior year and consistent with our original guidance of 1% to 3%. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales growth was lifted by higher surgical heart valve units, but was lowered by the planned exit of nonstrategic products. 
Sales of our premium products contributed to solid heart valve performance across all major regions led by procedural volume and share gains. Surgical heart valve units grew approximately 5% and global average selling pricing declined slightly due to country mix. 
During the fourth quarter, we submitted the PMA in support of the FDA approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve. We still expect the launch in the U.S. mid-2016. 
In Germany, adopters of our INTUITY Elite valve will now benefit from a new higher DRG for combined procedures. We believe this will support greater adoption of our rapid deployment valve for patients, who suffer from the combination of aortic stenosis and coronary disease, a common occurrence. 
Notably, a recent paper published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery concluded that our PERIMOUNT Magna Ease family of valves demonstrated excellent long-term durability and hydrodynamic performance after accelerated in vitro testing equivalent to 25 years of heartbeats. All valve studies successfully endured 1 billion cycles, which is 5x longer than the standard testing requirement for a tissue valve. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued strength of our premium surgical valve products and are preparing for new product launches in 2016. We continue to focus on improving therapy options for younger patients, streamlining complex surgeries and enabling minimally invasive procedures. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6%. 
In the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $141 million and grew 4% on an underlying basis. Total sales for 2015 were $528 million, up 3% over the prior year on an underlying basis, consistent with our original guidance of 2% to 4%. Global growth for the quarter was driven primarily by core hemodynamic monitoring products in the U.S. and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which recorded double-digit underlying growth across most regions. 
We are focused on strengthening our core offerings by strengthening our gold standard products, including a next-generation monitor. We are expanding our sales force in the U.S. to broaden the adoption of our market-leading products. And in Japan, we are expecting a contribution to growth from the launch of ClearSight, our noninvasive monitoring technology. Overall, we're pleased with the continuing adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products. We continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016. 
As we highlighted at our investor conference, we're investing in a number of structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress at our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve program, or TMVR, and our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation. Early U.S. feasibility studies with both of these technologies are currently underway. Additionally, we're continuing to closely follow our investments in the Harpoon chordal repair and the CardioKinetix heart failure therapies as they gain clinical experience. While all of these technologies are substantial opportunities, they do involve significant challenges and are in their early stages. 
Providing some more detail on our TMVR program. We've begun treating patients on our U.S. early feasibility study planned for 7 sites. Our learnings from these cases will inform our CE Mark trial, which is expected to begin in mid-2016. Our mitral team is currently working on enhancements to the CardiAQ Edwards valve platform, including additional sizes, delivery system refinements and the addition of Edwards' clinically proven bovine pericardial tissue. We're also currently developing additional next-generation TMVR products that leverage our experience. We're optimistic about the future of TMVR technology. And although commercialization time lines are still unclear, we continue to believe that TMVR will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease, who aren't well served today. 
And finally, in regards to the recently implemented 2-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax, we're evaluating a number of meaningful opportunities to accelerate existing growth programs or initiate new ones and, as such, we expect a minimal positive impact to 2016 earnings. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion",871,"Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion. Our gross profit margin was 75.2% and free cash flow was $447 million. In the fourth quarter, another strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove our topline to an overall 15% underlying sales growth rate. Unusually strong U.S. THV sales during the holiday season lifted performance above our expectations. The strong U.S. dollar continue to have a significant negative impact on reported sales, which grew 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63, representing 19% growth over the prior year. Total underlying sales in the fourth quarter were $667 million. This excludes the $4 million benefit of the THV sales return reserve as we substantially completed the SAPIEN 3 product exchange in the United States. 
I'll now cover the details behind our results and then share guidance for 2016. For the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.8% compared to 74.0% in the same period of 2014. We expected fourth quarter gross profit to be approximately 75% based on a more profitable product mix and a positive impact from foreign exchange hedge contracts. Our actual result was below our expectation because we elected to realign some Critical Care manufacturing operations to improve our cost structure. We continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 75% in 2016. 
Turning to SG&A. Fourth quarter expenses were $222 million or 33.1% of sales compared to $223 million in the prior year. The modest decrease was driven by the favorable foreign exchange impact on our expenses outside the United States, largely offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves. Given our increased THV sales estimate, we now expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year 2016, which is an improvement over our investor conference guidance. 
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 17% to $98 million or 14.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect research and development as a percentage of sales to be approximately 16%. We are evaluating the opportunities to reinvest the savings from the 2-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax. We are deploying a disciplined process to explore value-creating opportunities to accelerate existing programs or initiate new ones. 
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 16%, which benefited from the renewal of the federal research and development tax credit. Given the expected stronger sales of THV in the U.S., we now expect our full year 2016 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. And in light of recent legislation making the R&D tax credit permanent, we expect our rate to be relatively consistent across quarters. 
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million compared to the prior year driven by the weakening of the euro and yen. Compared to our October guidance, foreign exchange rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.01. At current rates, we continue to estimate a $55 million negative impact to full year 2016 sales. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $104 million and included a $33 million tax payment related to a previously reported litigation settlement. After capital spending of $37.5 million, free cash flow was $66.3 million. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion. Total debt was $600 million. During the full year 2015, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million split-adjusted shares for $280 million. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance, all of which assumes current foreign exchange rates. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, due to our strong momentum and expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are raising our 2016 guidance provided at our December investor conference to between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valve therapy of $780 million to $820 million; for Critical Care of $510 million to $550 million; and now expect total sales of $2.6 billion to $2.85 billion. Primarily as the result of increased expectations for sales, we are raising adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $2.57 and $2.67; free cash flow to $475 million to $525 million. The suspension of the medical device tax is expected to have minimal impact on 2016 earnings per share. We continue to expect shares outstanding in the range of 216 million to 220 million, which reflects our plan to repurchase shares during 2016. As we explained in our investor conference, adjusted earnings per share now excludes intangible amortization expense and prior period comparisons are available on our website. For the first quarter 2016, at current FX rates, we project total sales to be between $640 million and $680 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.70. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

Obviously, that's the commercial bet you're making, but you're going to be mixing, getting it from both the XT valve and also the SAPIEN 3 valve. That's question #1. Question #2 is, as we've been talking to physicians, there's an expectation for noninferiority versus surgery, but some hope that maybe you're able to show superiority. I wonder if you would just comment on that thought in general."

There are going to be 2 data sets that are substantial that are presented at the ACC. The original PARTNER II trial is a randomization of SAPIEN XT versus open heart valve replacement, so you'll see the results of that. That's a substantial study and, again, high-quality science. Within the contemporary time frame, we were able to introduce SAPIEN 3. And so literally added to the PARTNER II trial was this separate arm of 1,000 SAPIEN 3 patients that were also enrolled in intermediate patients. And the thought here is it's a comparison of SAPIEN 3 that you will be able to compare to both the SAPIEN XT data and also the surgical data, it was all done in a contemporary time frame. And since the SAPIEN 3 valve is the valve that's broadly in use today, I think the logic will hold together, and we're expecting that physicians and FDA will see it that way. So that's sort of point number one. Point number two, the way the trial was constructed, it was a noninferiority trial, and we really powered it for noninferiority. We have still a very large trial to power a trial for superiority. We assumed that the time would've taken a lot of patients. So we're still assuming that we are favorable on noninferiority. It's always possible that somebody can do a post-hoc analysis of the data and try and analyze whether it's superior, but it will be trying to do it with a number of patients that was really intended for -- to demonstrate noninferiority."

In fact, Scott, if you do the back envelope numbers and just took the midpoint of the prior sales range, the midpoint of the prior SG&A guidance and the midpoint of the new sales range, the new SG&A guidance actually implies, it would be incremental $100 million in sales, that SG&A is actually down slightly despite the incremental sales numbers.

These are tough to anticipate in advance just exactly how many centers are going to be into it. And what we find here is, with the success of TAVR and, actually, it appears to be a really learnable procedure, that centers are sincerely interested in having this option to offer to their patient. Just think, if you're a center that only offers a surgical option, you're not quite as attractive as you might be if you had a full range of options. So this is encouraging centers to come into it. In terms of how many, we do have somewhat of a backlog. It would be a real guess at this point, but maybe an additional 40 sites in 2016 might be added. Some of these sites, if we're successful in getting a pulmonic indication, might be pediatric sites that come in and learn TAVR as well. So it's an estimate, Jason. And hopefully, that helps you a little bit. In terms of what's going on over the holiday season, I suspect you're right. The shorter length of stays probably encouraged people to maybe take something on over the holidays that they might not have taken on if they had a long recovery period. We didn't anticipate it, so I can't tell you we had this all figured out in advance. This is more we watch the story and now we're applying our own explanations to why, but we probably have to dig a little deeper to understand it. But again, I'll just remind you on the bigger picture in terms of number of centers, we continue to see the large bulk of the growth come from these big hospitals that already have strong programs."

Well, unfortunately, there's not a single theme here. We've seen a variety of behaviors across hospitals. Because these procedures turn out to be shorter and more predictable, what it's done is it encouraged hospitals. So within the same cath lab or within the same OR, they can get more cases per day. And also some hospitals are looking at this, I think, relative to the demand out there and also their own economics, and they're just adding extra days. So maybe in the past, they used to do these cases only on Tuesday, and now they might happen on multiple days per week in that same hospital. So for the most part, it's not, if you will, bricks-and-mortar that's driving the capacity increase. I think it's more of a redistribution of their own internal capacity combined with just the improving efficiency of these procedures."

Remember, risk scores were established based on the risk to go through open-heart procedures, right? And so again, that was the context. For example, age is not even a part of the risk score. You can be over 90 and considered low risk. Many clinicians look at that today and say, ""Boy, I have a tough time believing that this 95-year-old is low risk."" But that is the way that the STS score can characterize it today. What's good news for patients is every one of those patients go through a heart team assessment. That's part of what the FDA label calls for and also what the CMS NCD calls for. And so risk scores are helpful, but they are not the only indicators that are used by clinicians. They'll include frailty, other factors like a hospital, chest, et cetera, when they go through their assessment. So we think people are being very diligent in terms of the way that they treat patients today.

We're -- we continually try and support organizations like the ACC and the American Heart Association and individual hospitals as they raise awareness, but you would -- shouldn't expect anything unusual beyond that. In terms of OUS and what's going to be their policies, it's probably going to be driven primarily by how they approach it from a reimbursement perspective. And so what we're going to be prepared to do as part of our low-risk trial is to also gather information on economics, gather information on the quality of life for these patients so that we can have a meaningful conversation with these payers around the world.

411220,321992671,925073,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year, both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total",1683,"Thank you, David. We're very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year, both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies. We exited the year with total global sales of $2.5 billion, representing an underlying growth rate of 17%, which is higher than we predicted a year ago. And just recently, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our PARTNER III trial to study patients determined to be at low surgical risk, which may eventually enable heart teams to offer a choice of therapies to a broader group of patients. 
For the quarter, total underlying sales grew to $267 million, an increase of 15%. Results were driven by robust demand for TAVR therapy and the strong performance of all product lines this quarter. 
In transcatheter heart valves, full year global sales were $1.2 billion, up 38% over the prior year on an underlying basis. We exceeded our original estimate of 15% to 25% provided a year ago, primarily due to the early approval of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and the more rapid than expected therapy adoption in Europe. 
For the fourth quarter, underlying global sales were up 32% over last year led by the impact of SAPIEN 3 in the U.S. and double-digit underlying sales growth across all regions. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 
In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter grew 50% versus the prior year to $189 million. Our performance was driven by procedure growth, which was unexpectedly strong during the holiday season and has not been our typical experience. We estimate that Edwards' growth was similar to the overall procedure growth. 
Nearly all of our existing accounts are now using our SAPIEN 3 valve. Growth was primarily driven by large hospitals and new site training continued during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with approximately 400 active centers. Our recently introduced 20-millimeter SAPIEN 3 valve was also a contributor. We believe the strong growth and adoption of TAVR in the U.S. was driven by the growing body of clinical evidence, increased physician experience and high procedural success. Many hospitals are responding to the increased demand by modifying their schedules to perform more procedures each week. We see this trend continuing as TAVR provides an attractive therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. We expect these patients will be encouraged to seek treatment as indications expand, which is the primary driver behind our belief that the global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion in 2021. 
Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew double digits in all regions aided by the continued rollout of SAPIEN XT in Japan. We estimate our OUS growth was roughly in line with overall therapy adoption. 
In Europe, we estimate that therapy adoption grew more than 20%, and our sales growth was somewhat lower. Our sales growth was primarily lifted by the continued adoption of SAPIEN 3. We estimate that more recent competitors continue to account for approximately 15% of total procedures. 
We saw strong growth across most countries and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region, with other countries growing faster than Germany for the past couple of quarters. Generally, reimbursement trends remain stable, allowing for continued growth and adoption. 
In 2016, expanding the indication to treat intermediate-risk patients remains a key focus. We expect data from the intermediate-risk cohorts in 2 studies to be presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in April, our randomized study of SAPIEN XT versus surgery and a study of SAPIEN 3. As we indicated at our investor conference, assuming positive results and an expedited FDA review, we're planning for a late 2016 U.S. approval and a minimal contribution to sales this year. We expect our Continued Access Program for intermediate-risk patients in the U.S. to continue until commercial approval. We plan to use the U.S. data in a CE Mark submission in Europe. 
And as I mentioned earlier, we received FDA approval to study an expanded indication for the SAPIEN 3 valve. The IDE study will enroll elderly patients at least 65 years of age with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, who've been determined by a heart team to be at low risk for mortality if they were to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement. The PARTNER III trial will enroll approximately 1,300 patients in up to 50 sites, and we're working now to secure IRB and contract approvals at those hospitals. Enrollment is expected to continue into 2017. And while we believe this procedure will be attractive to low-risk patients, randomized trials typically take longer to enroll. The SAPIEN 3 trial will also include a 400-patient sub-study using advanced imaging to evaluate leaflet motion in surgical and transcatheter tissue valves. We're looking forward to introducing our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system, which is on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter this year. This new system featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheet [ph] technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time. 
We also remain on track with our efforts to add the pulmonic indication to our SAPIEN family of valves. During the first quarter, we expect to receive approval and launch SAPIEN XT for this indication and then begin enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the SAPIEN 3 in Q2. 
In summary, based on our momentum and the expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 THV global sales estimate by $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth in 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 25%. 
Turning to the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Full year 2015 global sales were $785 million, up 2.5% on an underlying basis over the prior year and consistent with our original guidance of 1% to 3%. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales growth was lifted by higher surgical heart valve units, but was lowered by the planned exit of nonstrategic products. 
Sales of our premium products contributed to solid heart valve performance across all major regions, led by procedural volume and share gains. Surgical heart valve units grew approximately 5% and global average selling pricing declined slightly due to country mix. 
During the fourth quarter, we submitted the PMA in support of the FDA approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve. We still expect to launch in the U.S. mid-2016. 
In Germany, adopters of our INTUITY Elite valve will now benefit from a new higher DRG for combined procedures. We believe this will support greater adoption of our rapid deployment valve for patients who suffer from the combination of aortic stenosis and coronary disease, a common occurrence. 
Notably, a recent paper published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery concluded that our PERIMOUNT Magna Ease family of valves demonstrated excellent long-term durability and hydrodynamic performance after accelerated in vitro testing equivalent to 25 years of heartbeats. All valve studies successfully endured 1 billion cycles, which is 5x longer than the standard testing requirement for a tissue valve. 
In summary, we're pleased with the continued strength of our premium surgical valve products and are preparing for new product launches in 2016. We continue to focus on improving therapy options for younger patients, streamlining complex surgeries and enabling minimally invasive procedures. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6%. 
In the Critical Care product group, total sales for the quarter were $141 million and grew 4% on an underlying basis. Total sales for 2015 were $528 million, up 3% over the prior year on an underlying basis, consistent with our original guidance of 2% to 4%. Global growth for the quarter was driven primarily by core hemodynamic monitoring products in the U.S. and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which recorded double-digit underlying growth across most regions. 
We are focused on strengthening our core offerings by strengthening our gold standard products, including a next-generation monitor. We are expanding our sales force in the U.S. to broaden the adoption of our market-leading products. And in Japan, we are expecting a contribution to growth from the launch of ClearSight, our noninvasive monitoring technology. Overall, we're pleased with the continuing adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products. We continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016. 
As we highlighted at our investor conference, we're investing in a number of structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress in our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve program, or TMVR, and our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation. Early U.S. feasibility studies with both of these technologies are currently underway. Additionally, we're continuing to closely follow our investments in the Harpoon chordal repair and the CardioKinetix heart failure therapies as they gain clinical experience. While all of these technologies are substantial opportunities, they do involve significant challenges and are in their early stages. 
Providing some more detail on our TMVR program. We've begun treating patients on our U.S. early feasibility study planned for 7 sites. Our learnings from these cases will inform our CE Mark trial, which is expected to begin in mid-2016. Our mitral team is currently working on enhancements to the CardiAQ Edwards valve platform, including additional sizes, delivery system refinements and the addition of Edwards' clinically proven bovine pericardial tissue. We're also currently developing additional next-generation TMVR products that leverage our experience. We're optimistic about the future of TMVR technology. And although commercialization timelines are still unclear, we continue to believe that TMVR will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well served today. 
And finally, in regards to the recently implemented 2-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax, we're evaluating a number of meaningful opportunities to accelerate existing growth programs or initiate new ones, and as such, we expect a minimal positive impact to 2016 earnings. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion",873,"Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report that with our strong finish to the year, we achieved our 2015 key financial targets. For the full year, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29. Sales increased nearly 17% on an underlying basis to $2.5 billion. Our gross profit margin was 75.2% and free cash flow was $447 million. In the fourth quarter, another strong sales performance in transcatheter valves drove our top line to an overall 15% underlying sales growth rate. Unusually strong U.S. THV sales during the holiday season lifted performance above our expectations. The strong U.S. dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on reported sales, which grew 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63, representing 19% growth over the prior year. Total underlying sales in the fourth quarter were $667 million. This excludes the $4 million benefit of the THV sales return reserve, as we substantially completed the SAPIEN 3 product exchange in the United States. 
I'll now cover the details behind our results and then share guidance for 2016. For the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.8%, compared to 74.0% in the same period of 2014. We expected fourth quarter gross profit to be approximately 75% based on a more profitable product mix and a positive impact from foreign exchange hedge contracts. Our actual result was below our expectation because we elected to realign some Critical Care manufacturing operations to improve our cost structure. We continue to expect our gross profit margin, excluding special items, to be between 74% and 75% in 2016. 
Turning to SG&A. Fourth quarter expenses were $222 million or 33.1% of sales, compared to $223 million in the prior year. The modest decrease was driven by the favorable foreign exchange impact on our expenses outside the United States, largely offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves. Given our increased THV sales estimate, we now expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year 2016, which is an improvement over our investor conference guidance. 
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 17% to $98 million or 14.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect research and development as a percentage of sales to be approximately 16%. We are evaluating the opportunities to reinvest the savings from the 2-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax. We are deploying a disciplined process to explore value-creating opportunities to accelerate existing programs or initiate new ones. 
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 16%, which benefited from the renewal of the federal research and development tax credit. Given the expected stronger sales of THV in the U.S., we now expect our full year 2016 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. And in light of recent legislation making the R&D tax credit permanent, we expect our rate to be relatively consistent across quarters. 
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million compared to the prior year, driven by the weakening of the euro and yen. Compared to our October guidance, foreign exchange rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.01. At current rates, we continue to estimate a $55 million negative impact to full year 2016 sales. 
Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $104 million and included a $33 million tax payment related to a previously reported litigation settlement. After capital spending of $37.5 million, free cash flow was $66.3 million. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion. Total debt was $600 million. During the full year 2015, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million split-adjusted shares for $280 million. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance, all of which assumes current foreign exchange rates. For Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, due to our strong momentum and expectation of continued therapy adoption, we are raising our 2016 guidance provided at our December investor conference to between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valve therapy of $780 million to $820 million; for Critical Care of $510 million to $550 million; and now expect total sales of $2.6 billion to $2.85 billion. Primarily as the result of increased expectations for sales, we are raising adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $2.57 and $2.67 and free cash flow to $475 million to $525 million. The suspension of the medical device tax is expected to have minimal impact on 2016 earnings per share. We continue to expect shares outstanding in the range of 216 million to 220 million, which reflects our plan to repurchase shares during 2016. As we explained in our investor conference, adjusted earnings per share now excludes intangible amortization expense and prior period comparisons are available on our website. For the first quarter 2016, at current FX rates, we project total sales to be between $640 million and $680 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.70. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

Obviously, that's the commercial bet you're making, but you're going to be mixing, getting it from both the XT valve and also the SAPIEN 3 valve. That's question number one. Question number two is, as we've been talking to physicians, there's an expectation for non-inferiority versus surgery, but some hope that maybe you're able to show superiority. I wonder if you would just comment on that thought in general."

There are going to be 2 data sets that are substantial that are presented at the ACC. The original PARTNER II trial is a randomization of SAPIEN XT versus open heart valve replacement, so you'll see the results of that. That's a substantial study, and again, high-quality science. Within the contemporary time frame, we were able to introduce SAPIEN 3. And so literally added to the PARTNER II trial was this separate arm of 1,000 SAPIEN 3 patients that were also enrolled in intermediate patients. And the thought here is it's a comparison of SAPIEN 3 that you will be able to compare to both the SAPIEN XT data and also the surgical data, because it was all done in a contemporary time frame. And since the SAPIEN 3 valve is the valve that's broadly in use today, I think the logic will hold together, and we're expecting that physicians and FDA will see it that way. So that's sort of point number one. Point number two, the way the trial was constructed, it was a non-inferiority trial, and we really powered it for non-inferiority. It was still a very large trial. To power a trial for superiority, we assumed at the time would've taken a lot of patients. So we're still assuming that we are favorable on non-inferiority.

These are tough to anticipate in advance just exactly how many centers are going to be into it. And what we find here is with the success of TAVR, and actually, it appears to be a really learnable procedure, that centers are sincerely interested in having this option to offer to their patient. Just think, if you're a center that only offers a surgical option, you're not quite as attractive as you might be if you had a full range of options. So this is encouraging centers to come into it. In terms of how many, we do have somewhat of a backlog. It would be a real guess at this point, but maybe an additional 40 sites in 2016 might be added. Some of these sites, if we're successful in getting a pulmonic indication, might be pediatric sites that come in and learn TAVR as well. So it's an estimate, Jason, but hopefully, that helps you a little bit. In terms of what's going on over the holiday season, I suspect you're right. The shorter length of stays probably encouraged people to maybe take something on over the holidays that they might not have taken on if it had a long recovery period. We didn't anticipate it, so I can't tell you that we had this all figured out in advance. This is more we watched the story and now we're applying our own explanations to why, but we probably have to dig a little deeper to understand it. But again, I'll just remind you on the bigger picture in terms of number of centers, we continue to see the large bulk of the growth come from these big hospitals that already have strong programs."

And so the idea here is to actually have randomized patients, 400 in our case, and we wouldn't be surprised to see other companies following a similar standardized imaging protocol, and that this would actually be analyzed. So this would be covered in the short term under our study, and so it'd be a regular follow-up as part of this study with all of the bells and whistles that go along with a PARTNER III trial. And then these patients will be followed on a longer-term basis using the registry. So there would be a lot of science around this, and we'd have probably better data than we've ever had in the past. And what we'd be able to do is not just know whether there was some leaflet thickening that was viewed by imaging, but we'd get to find out is there a clinical consequence? Were there any strokes? Is there any mortality? Is there any kind of clinical consequence to those kinds of things? Are they temporary and do they go away, et cetera? We'll get more data than we've ever had on this, so it should be informative."

Because these procedures turn out to be shorter and more predictable, what it's done is it's encouraged hospitals. So within the same cath lab or within the same OR, they can get more cases per day. And also, some hospitals are looking at this, I think relative to the demand out there and also their own economics, and they're just adding extra days. So maybe in the past, they used to do these cases only on Tuesday, and now they might happen on multiple days per week in that same hospital. So for the most part, it's not, if you will, bricks-and-mortar that's driving the capacity increase. I think it's more of a redistribution of their own internal capacity, combined with just the improving efficiency of these procedures."

But that is the way that the STS score can characterize it today. What's good news for patients is every one of those patients go through a heart team assessment. That's part of what the FDA label calls for and also what the CMS NCD calls for. And so risk scores are helpful, but they are not the only indicators that are used by clinicians. They'll include frailty, other factors like a hostile chest, et cetera, when they go through their assessment.

Yes, in terms of recruitment, you can imagine, if you're a low-risk patient, and today, your only option is an open heart valve replacement, if you had an option to enter a clinical trial where you can get a transcatheter procedure, that might be attractive to you. So we don't expect to do anything unusual in terms of that. We're -- we continually try and support organizations like the ACC and the American Heart Association and individual hospitals as they raise awareness, but you would -- shouldn't expect anything unusual beyond that. In terms of OUS and what's going to be their policies, it's probably going to be driven primarily by how they approach it from a reimbursement perspective. And so what we're going to be prepared to do as part of our low-risk trial is to also gather information on economics, gather information on the quality of life for these patients so that we can have a meaningful conversation with these payers around the world. And what we're encouraged by is we think you get a pretty good bang for the buck in terms of the quality of life and the extension of life with this kind of technology compared to many other kinds of health care, and we'd like to think that we can back it up with data. 
All right. Well, thanks, all of you, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, back to you, David."

I'm just getting over a cold. But if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. So let's jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sales of $6",1380,"Thank you, David. pardon the scratchiness of my voice. I'm just getting over a cold. But if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. 
So let's jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sales of $697 million, representing an underlying growth rate of 20%. Significant transcatheter heart valve sales once again drove the majority of this quarter's growth with solid performance at our core businesses, in particular, Critical Care. 
We're also pleased to report strong bottom line results while aggressively investing in new therapies that can have meaningful future impact. And most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our lifesaving therapies than ever before. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global underlying sales were $366 million, up 38% over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption in the U.S. Globally, average selling prices remain stable. 
In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter were $215 million and grew 64% versus the prior year. Our performance was driven primarily by strong procedure growth with -- which continued to exceed our expectations. We saw this growth across both large and small TAVR sites, and it was fueled by the recent U.S. launch of SAPIEN 3. We estimate modest share gain also contributed to our results. 
Following the end of the quarter, at the American College of Cardiology meeting, data from intermediate-risk cohorts of 2 clinical studies were presented. The large randomized PARTNER II trial, which compared the SAPIEN XT valve to surgery met its primary endpoint of 2 years and demonstrated noninferiority when compared to surgery. 
The second trial showed with SAPIEN 3 TAVR demonstrated clinical superiority to surgery at 1 year on a composite endpoint and also on individual assessments of all cause mortality and stroke. We are very proud of these robust data and believe they provide powerful evidence in favor of expanding the SAPIEN 3 technology to a broader population of patients with aortic stenosis. 
We remain on track to submit the final intermediate-risk data sets to the FDA in the next couple of weeks. Based on the strength of these data, it's possible for the approval to come earlier than expected, although it's difficult to predict regulatory timelines. We are now modeling an approval and launch at the beginning of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, intermediate-risk patients continue to be treated with our continued access protocol of the PARTNER II trial, which has been tracking at about $10 million in sales per quarter. This would end as commercial sales begin.
Enrollment in our PARTNER III trial began recently. This randomized trial will study SAPIEN 3 in more than 1,200 low-risk patients, and enrollment is expected to continue in 2017. 
We are pleased to receive a poemonic indication for SAPIEN XT this quarter. This will allow for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients in the U.S. who suffer from either a narrowed pulmonary valve or regurgitation caused by congenital heart disease. 
Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 13%, driven by ongoing therapy adoption in Europe and Japan. Also, our SAPIEN 3 valve was approved in the first quarter in Japan, and we are currently in the process of training sites on this best-in-class valve in preparation for a rollout beginning next month.
In Europe, we estimate the procedures continue to grow more than 20% in the first quarter compared to last year. We saw strong growth across most countries, and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region with other countries growing faster than Germany. Edwards grew at a slower rate, and we estimate our market share decreased as competitors continue to broaden their product offerings. While difficult to estimate, we believe that more recent competitive entrants collectively realize a significant year-over-year growth rate, but account for approximately 15% or so of total procedures.
As we previously mentioned, we plan to use our U.S. intermediate-risk data to expand our CE Mark indication. These data will be submitted to European regulators in the next few weeks with the expectation for approval of an expanded label in late '16 or early '17. Because some European countries have already been aggressive adopters of TAVR technology, overall, we expect the strong data reported in ACC to have limited impact on European treatment rates until guidelines are updated and where applicable, reimbursement is modified to cover the broader label. 
Our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system is still on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter of this year. This new system, featuring and on-boom -- on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheeve technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.
In summary, we continue to believe that TAVR provides an important and compelling therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. Based primarily on the continuing strong therapy adoption of TAVR, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 25%. 
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the first quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales were lifted by an increase in surgical heart valve units, which we believe was primarily driven by greater aortic disease awareness that prompted a larger number of surgical procedures. Our growth was offset by the ongoing exit of nonstrategic cannula products. 
Sales of our premium products contribute to solid heart valve performance across the U.S., Europe and Japan. Worldwide surgical aortic unit grew approximately 7%, and global average selling prices saw a slight decline. 
In Japan, we recently launched our tricuspid surgical valve repair product and have seen strong interest in this therapy. We've been in discussions with the FDA regarding approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve and believe we remain on track for a mid-2016 launch in the U.S. Additionally, in response to our application for a new technology add-on payment for INTUITY Elite, CMS has expressed concern that the technology may not meet certain eligibility criteria, and our team is preparing a formal response.
In summary, we're pleased with the strength of our premium surgical heart valve products. We continue to invest in this area and believe that surgery will continue to be -- continue to have a vital role for patients even as TAVR expands. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6% as we expect stronger second half growth from INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S. at a diminishing impact from the exit of nonstrategic cannula products. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $134 million and grew 9% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which once again recorded double-digit underlying sales growth across more -- across most regions. 
Our sales this quarter benefited from the announced discontinuation of a legacy monitor that lifted replacement monitor sales. Our recent investments in U.S. sales resources also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Overall, we're pleased with the continued adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products, and we continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016.
Turning to our investments in structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform, or TMVR, which we expect to be the first of multiple generations. In our early generation, CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're already in the process of implementing several enhancements, and we expect clinical updates to be presented later this year. Learnings from our experience in the U.S. early feasibility study now underway have informed our first CE Mark trial called the Relief trial, which is still on track to begin middle of this year. We remain committed to developing this therapy. And although commercialization timelines are still unclear, we continue to believe that innovative structural heart therapies will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well served today. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott."

This quarter, our underlying sales were $696 million and grew 20% on an underlying basis, which exceeded our expectations for 2 reasons. First, strong THV sales drove performance to the top end of our guidance range; and second, strengthening foreign currencies since last quarter's guidance contributed over $10 million. Reported sales, including the effects of foreign exchange and the sales return reserve, grew 18% to $697 million. 
We have made strategic decisions about how to utilize savings from the 2-year suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. The suspension provided us flexibility to reinvest in research and development, for example, by accelerating investments in structural heart initiatives. We also made a special $5 million contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation in support of the Every Heartbeat Matters initiative. This initiative is focused on addressing the global burden of heart valve disease in underserved people. The $5 million contribution is reflected in the other expense line of our income statement. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 25% versus prior year to $0.71, primarily driven by our THV sales performance and reflects solid leverage. This growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, increased research and development investments and our charitable contribution. 
I'll now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 74.1% compared to 77% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventory sold internationally and higher spending in our global manufacturing operations, partially offset by a more profitable product mix. To accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are investing in manufacturing capacity, which will negatively impact our gross profit margin for the remainder of 2016. Combined with a lower-than-expected benefit from FX contracts, we now expect our full year gross profit rate, excluding special items, to be between 73% and 74%. 
First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% over the prior year to $213 million or 30.5% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales in marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves and personnel-related expenses. This was partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax as well as the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.
Research and development investments in the quarter increased 19% over the prior year to $102 million or 14.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs and a lower-than-normal spend in the prior year quarter. The suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax provided additional flexibility to accelerate investments in structural heart initiatives this quarter. We continue to expect our research and development investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales for the full year.
During the first quarter, we recorded $12.2 million in intellectual property-related expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include the resolution of an IP matter and expenses related to ongoing litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific where we now have multiple litigation matters in the U.S. and Europe. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 22%, down from 24.1% in the prior year period. This decrease was driven largely by our manufacturing sourcing strategy. We now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%.
Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales by $9 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate minimal impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. This is $55 million less than the impact we estimated last quarter. Compared to our February guidance, foreign exchange rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share in the first quarter.
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $79 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $107 million less capital spending of $28 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash and equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $950 million. Total debt was approximately $600 million. In February 2016, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements for $325 million. Upon entering into the agreements, we received and retired an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares. As a result, average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $218 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 of $216 million to $220 million.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We now expect full year sales to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, an increase from last quarter's guidance of more than $100 million at the midpoint of the range. This increase reflects an anticipated $55 million of improvement from foreign exchange as well as higher expectations for THV as a result of strong momentum in the first quarter, the strength of the PARTNER II data presented at ACC and a planned earlier U.S. indication expansion for SAPIEN 3. We now expect THV sales of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. 
Our sales guidance for surgical heart valves and Critical Care remain unchanged. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million and for Critical Care within the range of $510 million to $550 million. 
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.67, $2.77. We expect the earnings per share drop-through of today's sales guidance increase to be lower than last quarter's due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange contracts, increased performance-based compensation and increased expenses associated with the expansion of manufacturing capacity. 
For the second quarter of 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $700 million and $740 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.73. 
Finally, for full year 2016, given our expected improved operating performance, we now expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
So with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

There's an awful lot that goes behind the scenes as we try to indicate we're implementing a number of enhancements to that CardiAQ platform. That's really one of our earliest versions of this transcatheter valve. But we still have a lot to learn. So we're going to be jumping in this trial. We're enthusiastic about getting into the trial, but we have to admit we're on a steep learning curve and we're putting a priority. I'm getting that clinical experience because as we get that, it gives us so much more guidance in terms of how we ought to be running the program. So as we try to say a lot of uncertainty in timelines, at this point because of early it is with these programs, but we're pleased with where we are right now."

In terms of how we're behaving, we're really not changing our pricing practices. We have -- our pricing has been very stable. We do have some very small downward drift, but that's purely based on volume discounts and has been consistent with what we've been doing.

First, has to do with the ability of U.S. TAVR centers to absorb the influx of intermediate patients. Since ACC, we've done a lot of checks, and it seems like U.S. TAVR centers have been anticipating the intermediate label and have been making plans to expand their capacity. But Mike, I just wanted to hear from you, have you been hearing consistent type of feedback as you've been traveling since ACC? And I guess, I'm asking you just because I want to make sure that once the intermediate label is added into the United States, we don't start to see bottlenecks at U.S. centers. That's question one. And then question two, is there going to be -- are we going to see new mitral data at PCR from Edwards?"

But we've been really impressed with the ability of hospitals to add capacity. And we expect that they're going to continue to do it. With the -- even with expansion of guidance that we provided for 2016, the capacity increase run average hospital in the U.S. is relatively small, probably less than 10%. So we really don't think that the capacity increase or hospitals or probably a good strength in the near term. And we don't get a lot of signals back from our hospital customers that they're overly concerned about it. They seem to have something in the works in most places. As it relates to mitral valves, we don't expect any major clinical updates at PCR. And I would guess there'll be some incremental information shared, but remember, we're in an early feasibility trial, so there's really no major clinical updates to share at this time. I would there will be something later in the year. Yes."

I'd say pardon the scratchiness in my voice. I'm just getting over a cold. But if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. So let's jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sal",1385,"Thank you, David. I'd say pardon the scratchiness in my voice. I'm just getting over a cold. But if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. 
So let's jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sales of $697 million, representing an underlying growth rate of 20%. Significant transcatheter heart valve sales once again drove the majority of this quarter's growth with solid performance at our core businesses, in particular, Critical Care. 
We're also pleased to report strong bottom line results while aggressively investing in new therapies that can have meaningful future impact. And most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our lifesaving therapies than ever before. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global underlying sales were $366 million, up 38% over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption in the U.S. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 
In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter were $215 million and grew 64% versus the prior year. Our performance was driven primarily by strong procedure growth with continue -- which continued to exceed our expectations. We saw this growth across both large and small TAVR sites, and it was fueled by the recent U.S. launch of SAPIEN 3. We estimate modest share gain also contributed to our results. 
Following the end of the quarter, at the American College of Cardiology meeting, data from intermediate-risk cohorts of 2 clinical studies were presented. The large randomized PARTNER II trial, which compared the SAPIEN XT valve to surgery, met its primary endpoint at 2 years and demonstrated non-inferiority when compared to surgery. 
The second trial showed that SAPIEN 3 TAVR demonstrated clinical superiority to surgery at 1 year on a composite endpoint and also on individual assessments of all-cause mortality and stroke. We are very proud of these robust data and believe they provide powerful evidence in favor of expanding the SAPIEN 3 technology to a broader population of patients with aortic stenosis. 
We remain on track to submit the final intermediate-risk data sets to the FDA at the next couple of weeks. Based on the strength of these data, it's possible for the approval to come earlier than expected, although it's difficult to predict regulatory time lines. We are now modeling an approval and launch at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, intermediate-risk patients continue to be treated with our continued access protocol of the PARTNER II trial, which has been tracking at about $10 million in sales per quarter. This would end as commercial sales begin.
Enrollment in our PARTNER III trial began recently. This randomized trial will study SAPIEN 3 in more than 1,200 low-risk patients, and enrollment is expected to continue in 2017. 
We are pleased to receive a pulmonic indication for SAPIEN XT this quarter. This will allow for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients in the U.S. who suffer from either a narrowed pulmonary valve or regurgitation caused by congenital heart disease. 
Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 13%, driven by ongoing therapy adoption in Europe and Japan. Also, our SAPIEN 3 valve was approved in the first quarter in Japan, and we are currently in the process of training sites on this best-in-class valve in preparation for a rollout beginning next month.
In Europe, we estimate the procedures continue to grow more than 20% in the first quarter compared to last year. We saw strong growth across most countries, and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region, with other countries growing faster than Germany. 
Edwards grew at a slower rate, and we estimate our market share decrease as competitors continue to broaden their product offerings. While difficult to estimate, we believe that more recent competitive entrants collectively realize a significant year-over-year growth rate, but account for approximately 15% or so of total procedures.
As we previously mentioned, we plan to use our U.S. intermediate-risk data to expand our CE Mark indication. These data will be submitted to European regulators in the next few weeks with the expectation for approval of an expanded label in late '16 or early '17. Because some European countries have already been aggressive adopters of TAVR technology, overall, we expect the strong data reported at ACC to have limited impact on European treatment rates until guidelines are updated, and, where applicable, reimbursement is modified to cover the broader label. 
Our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system is still on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter of this year. This new system, featuring an on-boom -- on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheeve technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.
In summary, we continue to believe that TAVR provides an important and compelling therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. Based primarily on the continuing strong therapy adoption of TAVR, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 25%. 
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the first quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales were lifted by an increase in surgical heart valve units, which we believe was primarily driven by greater aortic disease awareness that prompted a larger number of surgical procedures. Our growth was offset by the ongoing exit of nonstrategic cannula products. 
Sales of our premium products contribute to solid heart valve performance across the U.S., Europe and Japan. Worldwide surgical aortic units grew approximately 7%, and global average selling prices saw a slight decline. 
In Japan, we recently launched our tricuspid surgical valve repair product and have seen strong interest in this therapy. 
We've been in discussions with the FDA regarding approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve and believe we remain on track for a mid-2016 launch in the U.S. 
Additionally, in response to our application for a new technology add-on payment for INTUITY Elite, CMS has expressed concern that the technology may not meet certain eligibility criteria, and our team is preparing a formal response.
In summary, we're pleased with the strength of our premium surgical heart valve products. We continue to invest in this area and believe that surgery will continue to be -- continue to have a vital role for patients even as TAVR expands. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6% as we expect stronger second half growth from INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S. at a diminishing impact from the exit of nonstrategic cannula products. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $134 million and grew 9% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which once again recorded double-digit underlying sales growth across more -- across most regions. 
Our sales this quarter benefited from the announced discontinuation of a legacy monitor that lifted replacement monitor sales. Our recent investments in U.S. sales resources also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continued adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products, and we continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016.
Turning to our investments in structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform, or TMVR, which we expect to be the first of multiple generations. In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're already in the process of implementing several enhancements, and we expect clinical updates to be presented later this year. 
Learnings from our experience in the U.S. early feasibility study now underway have informed our first CE Mark trial called the relief [ph] trial, which is still on track to begin middle of this year. We remain committed to developing this therapy. And although commercialization time lines are still unclear, we continue to believe that innovative structural heart therapies will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well served today. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott."

This quarter, our underlying sales were $696 million and grew 20% on an underlying basis, which exceeded our expectations for 2 reasons: first, strong THV sales drove performance to the top end of our guidance range; and second, strengthening foreign currencies since last quarter's guidance contributed over $10 million. Reported sales, including the effects of foreign exchange and the sales return reserve, grew 18% to $697 million. 
We have made strategic decisions about how to utilize savings from the 2-year suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. The suspension provided us flexibility to reinvest in research and development, for example, by accelerating investments in structural heart initiatives. We also made a special $5 million contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation in support of the Every Heartbeat Matters initiative. This initiative is focused on addressing the global burden of heart valve disease in underserved people. The $5 million contribution is reflected in the other expense line of our income statement. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 25% versus prior year to $0.71, primarily driven by our THV sales performance and reflects solid leverage. This growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, increased research and development investments and our charitable contribution. 
I'll now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 74.1% compared to 77% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventories sold internationally and higher spending in our global manufacturing operations, partially offset by a more profitable product mix. To accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are investing in manufacturing capacity, which will negatively impact our gross profit margin for the remainder of 2016. Combined with a lower-than-expected benefit from FX contracts, we now expect our full year gross profit rate, excluding special items, to be between 73% and 74%. 
First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% over the prior year to $213 million or 30.5% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales in marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves and personnel-related expenses. This was partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax as well as the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.
Research and development investments in the quarter increased 19% over the prior year to $102 million or 14.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs and a lower-than-normal spend in the prior year quarter. The suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax provided additional flexibility to accelerate investments in structural heart initiatives this quarter. We continue to expect our research and development investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales for the full year.
During the first quarter, we recorded $12.2 million in intellectual property-related expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include the resolution of an IP matter and expenses related to ongoing litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific where we now have multiple litigation matters in the U.S. and Europe. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 22%, down from 24.1% in the prior year period. This decrease was driven largely by our manufacturing sourcing strategy. We now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%.
Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales by $9 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate minimal impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. This is $55 million less than the impact we estimated last quarter. Compared to our February guidance, foreign exchange rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share in the first quarter.
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $79 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $107 million less capital spending of $28 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash and equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $950 million. Total debt was approximately $600 million. In February 2016, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements for $325 million. Upon entering into the agreements, we received and retired an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares. As a result, average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $218 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 of $216 million to $220 million.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We now expect full year sales to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, an increase from last quarter's guidance of more than $100 million at the midpoint of the range. This increase reflects an anticipated $55 million of improvement from foreign exchange as well as higher expectations for THV as a result of strong momentum in the first quarter, the strength of the PARTNER II data presented at ACC and a planned earlier U.S. indication expansion for SAPIEN 3. We now expect THV sales of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. 
Our sales guidance for surgical heart valves and Critical Care remained unchanged. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million and for Critical Care within the range of $510 million to $550 million. 
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.67, $2.77. We expect the earnings per share drop-through of today's sales guidance increase to be lower than last quarter's due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange contracts, increased performance-based compensation and increased expenses associated with the expansion of manufacturing capacity. 
For the second quarter of 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $700 million and $740 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.73. 
Finally, for full year 2016, given our expected improved operating performance, we now expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
So with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

In terms of PCR, I don't know that you're going to see anything like you saw at ACC where you're going to see those kind of large trials. I'm sure there are going to be a lot of transcatheter heart valve papers in news, but I'm not expecting anything that's major that really is going to cause, really, a change in terms of behavior, at least in my mind."

But we have to admit, we're on a steep learning curve, and we're putting a priority.

But what is the outlook long term for surgical valves in the context of a growing TAVR market?"

We think that, that will indeed happen, that patients with isolated aortic stenosis more and more are going to be treated with TAVR instead of surgery. But again, this is -- there's still going to be -- this will be a slow process. Low risk is still going to be treated by surgery. And then over time, there are a number of things that are underlying trends that allow -- or that cause us to believe that surgical valves will continue to grow. There's an aging global demographics. There's a lot of patients internationally that don't get access to technology today. There's some really exciting surgical innovations coming like INTUITY and more. There's still patients getting mechanical valves, if you can believe it, that I imagine will switch tissue over time. So there's a number of factors, and we're going to help try and fuel that. So we're optimistic that we're still going to have a positive growth rate even though there's going to be a very significant move of TAVR into intermediate-risk patients."

But we've been really impressed with the ability of hospitals to add capacity, and we expect that they're going to continue to do it. With the -- even with the expansion of guidance that we provided for 2016, the capacity increase for an average hospital in the U.S. is relatively small, probably less than 10%. So we really don't think that the capacity increase for hospitals are probably a good strength in the near term. And we don't get a lot of signals back from our hospital customers that they're overly concerned about it. They seem to have something in the works in most places. As it relates to mitral valves, we don't expect any major clinical updates at EuroPCR. And I would guess there'll be some incremental information shared. But remember, we're in an early feasibility trial, so there's really no major clinical updates to share at this time. I would expect there will be something later in the year, yes.

I'd say pardon the scratchiness in my voice. I'm just getting over a cold. But if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. So let's jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sal",1386,"Thank you, David. I'd say pardon the scratchiness in my voice. I'm just getting over a cold. But if my voice gives out, I'll ask for Scott to help me out. 
So let's jump into it. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2016 with first quarter sales of $697 million, representing an underlying growth rate of 20%. Significant transcatheter heart valve sales once again drove the majority of this quarter's growth with solid performance in our core businesses, in particular, Critical Care. 
We're also pleased to report strong bottom line results while aggressively investing in new therapies that can have meaningful future impact. And most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our lifesaving therapies than ever before. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global underlying sales were $366 million, up 38% over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption in the U.S. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 
In the U.S., underlying THV sales for the quarter were $215 million and grew 64% versus the prior year. Our performance was driven primarily by strong procedure growth with continue -- which continued to exceed our expectations. We saw this growth across both large and small TAVR sites, and it was fueled by the recent U.S. launch of SAPIEN 3. We estimate modest share gain also contributed to our results. 
Following the end of the quarter, at the American College of Cardiology meeting, data from intermediate-risk cohorts of 2 clinical studies were presented. The large randomized PARTNER II trial, which compared the SAPIEN XT valve to surgery, met its primary endpoint at 2 years and demonstrated non-inferiority when compared to surgery. 
The second trial showed that SAPIEN 3 TAVR demonstrated clinical superiority to surgery at 1 year on a composite endpoint and also on individual assessments of all-cause mortality and stroke. We are very proud of these robust data and believe they provide powerful evidence in favor of expanding the SAPIEN 3 technology to a broader population of patients with aortic stenosis. 
We remain on track to submit the final intermediate-risk data sets to the FDA at the next couple of weeks. Based on the strength of these data, it's possible for the approval to come earlier than expected, although it's difficult to predict regulatory time lines. We are now modeling an approval and launch at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, intermediate-risk patients continue to be treated with our continued access protocol of the PARTNER II trial, which has been tracking at about $10 million in sales per quarter. This would end as commercial sales begin.
Enrollment in our PARTNER III trial began recently. This randomized trial will study SAPIEN 3 in more than 1,200 low-risk patients, and enrollment is expected to continue in 2017. 
We are pleased to receive a pulmonic indication for SAPIEN XT this quarter. This will allow for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients in the U.S. who suffer from either a narrowed pulmonary valve or regurgitation caused by congenital heart disease. 
Outside the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 13%, driven by ongoing therapy adoption in Europe and Japan. Also, our SAPIEN 3 valve was approved in the first quarter in Japan, and we are currently in the process of training sites on this best-in-class valve in preparation for a rollout beginning next month.
In Europe, we estimate the procedures continue to grow more than 20% in the first quarter compared to last year. We saw strong growth across most countries, and total procedures are becoming more dispersed throughout the region, with other countries growing faster than Germany. 
Edwards grew at a slower rate, and we estimate our market share decrease as competitors continue to broaden their product offerings. While difficult to estimate, we believe that more recent competitive entrants collectively realized a significant year-over-year growth rate, but account for approximately 15% or so of total procedures.
As we previously mentioned, we plan to use our U.S. intermediate-risk data to expand our CE Mark indication. These data will be submitted to European regulators in the next few weeks with the expectation for approval of an expanded label in late '16 or early '17. Because some European countries have already been aggressive adopters of TAVR technology, overall, we expect the strong data reported at ACC to have limited impact on European treatment rates until guidelines are updated, and, where applicable, reimbursement is modified to cover the broader label. 
Our SAPIEN 3 Ultra system is still on track for CE Mark in the fourth quarter of this year. This new system, featuring an on-boom -- on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.
In summary, we continue to believe that TAVR provides an important and compelling therapy option for a large number of untreated elderly patients. Based primarily on the continuing strong therapy adoption of TAVR, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 25%. 
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the first quarter were $196 million, up slightly over last year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales were lifted by an increase in surgical heart valve units, which we believe was primarily driven by greater aortic disease awareness that prompted a larger number of surgical procedures. Our growth was offset by the ongoing exit of nonstrategic cannula products. 
Sales of our premium products contribute to solid heart valve performance across the U.S., Europe and Japan. Worldwide surgical aortic units grew approximately 7%, and global average selling prices saw a slight decline. 
In Japan, we recently launched our tricuspid surgical valve repair product and have seen strong interest in this therapy. 
We've been in discussions with the FDA regarding approval of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve and believe we remain on track for a mid-2016 launch in the U.S. 
Additionally, in response to our application for a new technology add-on payment for INTUITY Elite, CMS has expressed concern that the technology may not meet certain eligibility criteria, and our team is preparing a formal response.
In summary, we're pleased with the strength of our premium surgical heart valve products. We continue to invest in this area and believe that surgery will continue to be -- will continue to have a vital role for patients even as TAVR expands. We are reiterating our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the total product group of 3% to 6% as we expect stronger second half growth from INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S. and a diminishing impact from the exit of nonstrategic cannula products. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $134 million and grew 9% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which once again recorded double-digit underlying sales growth across more -- across most regions. 
Our sales this quarter benefited from the announced discontinuation of a legacy monitor that lifted replacement monitor sales. Our recent investments in U.S. sales resources also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continued adoption of Enhanced Surgical Recovery and the strengthening of our core products, and we continue to expect Critical Care underlying sales growth of 2% to 4% in 2016.
Turning to our investments in structural heart initiatives. We continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform, or TMVR, which we expect to be the first of multiple generations. In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're already in the process of implementing several enhancements, and we expect clinical updates to be presented later this year. 
Learnings from our experience in the U.S. early feasibility study now underway have informed our first CE Mark trial called the RELIEF trial, which is still on track to begin the middle of this year. We remain committed to developing this therapy. And although commercialization time lines are still unclear, we continue to believe that innovative structural heart therapies will ultimately benefit patients with mitral valve disease who aren't well served today. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott."

This quarter, our underlying sales were $696 million and grew 20% on an underlying basis, which exceeded our expectations for 2 reasons: first, strong THV sales drove performance to the top end of our guidance range; and second, strengthening foreign currencies since last quarter's guidance contributed over $10 million. Reported sales, including the effects of foreign exchange and the sales return reserve, grew 18% to $697 million. 
We have made strategic decisions about how to utilize savings from the 2-year suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. The suspension provided us flexibility to reinvest in research and development, for example, by accelerating investments in structural heart initiatives. We also made a special $5 million contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation in support of the Every Heartbeat Matters initiative. This initiative is focused on addressing the global burden of heart valve disease in underserved people. The $5 million contribution is reflected in the other expense line of our income statement. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 25% versus prior year to $0.71, primarily driven by our THV sales performance and reflects solid leverage. This growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, increased research and development investments and our charitable contribution. 
I'll now cover the details behind our results, including guidance for the remainder of the year. For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 74.1% compared to 77% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventories sold internationally and higher spending in our global manufacturing operations, partially offset by a more profitable product mix. To accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are investing in manufacturing capacity, which will negatively impact our gross profit margin for the remainder of 2016. Combined with a lower-than-expected benefit from FX contracts, we now expect our full year gross profit rate, excluding special items, to be between 73% and 74%. 
First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% over the prior year to $213 million or 30.5% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves and personnel-related expenses. This was partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax as well as the favorable FX impact on our expenses outside the U.S. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.
Research and development investments in the quarter increased 19% over the prior year to $102 million or 14.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs and a lower-than-normal spend in the prior year quarter. The suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax provided additional flexibility to accelerate investments in structural heart initiatives this quarter. We continue to expect our research and development investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales for the full year.
During the first quarter, we recorded $12.2 million in intellectual property-related expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include the resolution of an IP matter and expenses related to ongoing litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific where we now have multiple litigation matters in the U.S. and Europe. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 22%, down from 24.1% in the prior year period. This decrease was driven largely by our manufacturing sourcing strategy. We now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%.
Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales by $9 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate minimal impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. This is $55 million less than the impact we estimated last quarter. Compared to our February guidance, foreign exchange rates had less than a $0.01 impact on earnings per share in the first quarter.
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $79 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $107 million less capital spending of $28 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash and equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $950 million. Total debt was approximately $600 million. In February 2016, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements for $325 million. Upon entering into the agreements, we received and retired an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares. As a result, average shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $218 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 of $216 million to $220 million.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We now expect full year sales to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, an increase from last quarter's guidance of more than $100 million at the midpoint of the range. This increase reflects an anticipated $55 million of improvement from foreign exchange as well as higher expectations for THV as a result of strong momentum in the first quarter, the strength of the PARTNER II data presented at ACC and a planned earlier U.S. indication expansion for SAPIEN 3. We now expect THV sales of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. 
Our sales guidance for surgical heart valves and Critical Care remained unchanged. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million and for Critical Care within the range of $510 million to $550 million. 
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.67, $2.77. We expect the earnings per share drop-through of today's sales guidance increase to be lower than last quarter's due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange contracts, increased performance-based compensation and increased expenses associated with the expansion of manufacturing capacity. 
For the second quarter of 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $700 million and $740 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.73. 
Finally, for full year 2016, given our expected improved operating performance, we now expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
So with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

There was another 70 basis points reduction from operations, including this manufacturing capacity expansion. And then the mix improvement helped gross margin by about 200 basis points."

And then over time, there are a number of things that are underlying trends that allow -- or that cause us to believe that surgical valves will continue to grow. There's an aging global demographics. There's a lot of patients internationally that don't get access to technology today. There's some really exciting surgical innovations coming like INTUITY and more. There's still patients getting mechanical valves, if you can believe it, that I imagine will switch to tissue over time. So there's a number of factors, and we're going to help try and fuel that. So we're optimistic that we're still going to have a positive growth rate even though there's going to be a very significant move of TAVR into intermediate-risk patients."

So we really don't think that the capacity increase for hospitals are probably a constraint in the near term. And we don't get a lot of signals back from our hospital customers that they're overly concerned about it. They seem to have something in the works in most places. As it relates to mitral valves, we don't expect any major clinical updates at EuroPCR. And I would guess there'll be some incremental information shared. But remember, we're in an early feasibility trial, so there's really no major clinical updates to share at this time. I would expect there will be something later in the year, yes.

We're very pleased to report strong second quarter performance, which reflect the significant growth in the number of patients and physicians choosing transcatheter heart valves therapies. [indiscernible] quarter were better than expected, driving strong top and bottom line growth. Global sales grew 21% on an underlying basis, reflecting significant transcatheter heart valve sales that once again drove the majority of the quarter's growth with a solid contribution through Critical Care.  [indiscernible] sales were $419 [ph] million, up 45% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies [indiscernible] strength in the U.S. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 
In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve sales for the quarter were $246 million and grew 66% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall, procedure growth exceeded our expectations, strong sales were widespread in both large and small hospitals. Positive clinical results continue to drive adoption [indiscernible] clinician fees [indiscernible] Final intermediate risk data sets were submitted to the FDA and are awaiting through approval [indiscernible] expanded indication. Although it's always predict regulatory time lines, based on the strength of this data, we anticipate that approval will be perceived during the third quarter. As a reminder, intermediate-risk patients continue to be treated through our continuous access protocol of the PARTNER II trial, which [indiscernible] $10 million in sales per quarter. This would end as commercial sales begin. 
Enrollment in our PARTNER III low-risk trial is underway and approximately half of our expected trial sites are active. As a reminder, this is a randomized trial, and although difficult to estimate [indiscernible] 2017. And as a request [indiscernible] therapy to a broader group of patients, we are revising the trial protocol [indiscernible] 65 years or older [indiscernible] underlying THV sales grew 23% driven by the ongoing therapy adoption in primarily in Europe [indiscernible] we are pleased with the adoption team in Japan following the launch of SAPIEN 3 earlier this year and we expect [indiscernible] strong contributor to long-term growth. 
In Europe, we estimate total procedures grew around 25% in the second quarter compared to last year or approximately 20% when adjusted for additional selling days this year. Edwards procedures grew at about the same rate. While the PARTNER II data published in April was widely acknowledged, we do not [indiscernible] provided a significant list in the quarter. We saw strong procedure growth across nearly all countries and particularly strong growth in countries outside of Germany. While difficult to estimate, we believe more recent competitive entrants continue to account for about 15% of total European  procedures. As we mentioned, we're using our U.S. intermediate-risk patients in expansion of our CE Mark indication. This data was submitted to European regulators during the quarter and we continue to expect approval of an expanded label in late 2016 or early 2017. We expect gradual expansion into intermediate-risk patients when the label is broadened and clinical guidance are revised. Our updated guidance anticipates that OUS sales may reflect a negative impact in the fourth quarter. The country of France and the polices [indiscernible] annual TAVR procedures. Strong therapy adoption there is outpacing this year's rate. We are working with the ministry of health in an effort to increase the procedure limit. In the absence of resolution, we expect to discontinue sales in France for the remainder of 2016 when the cap is reached, and this assumption is reflected in our guidance. 
Given the strong performance of SAPIEN 3, we have decided to incorporate additional benefits into our new Ultra system for its introduction. This will move the expected European launch to the second half of 2017. This new system featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further possible -- further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time. 
Questions about transcatheter valve durability, which were first discussed during a EuroPCR presentation, were subsequently more thoroughly addressed at the TVT meeting last month. Physician presentations suggest that there is a lack of evidence that TAVR valve durability differs from surgical valves. Edwards has always distinguished itself on the best-in-class performance in heart valves, and we remain confident in our SAPIEN platform and are generating long-term follow-up data in our PARTNER Trials. 
In summary, based on our strong first half results and anticipated third quarter approval of intermediate risk in the U.S. and momentum of global therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 30%. 
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the second quarter were $199 million, a decrease of 3% over last year on an underlying basis. Sales of the surgical mitral valves decline, which was partially offset by solid growth in surgical aortic valves. Globally, sales of our surgical mitral valves were impacted during the quarter due to our identification of a production matter related to the holder that assists surgeons during implantation of the valve, which cost us to temporarily suspend production. We have recently resumed shipping and expect a smaller impact in the third quarter as we replenish inventories. 
Worldwide, surgical aortic valve units grew approximately 5% and global average selling price saw a slight decline due to regional mix. INTUITY Elite drove sales growth in Europe. And in Japan, growth was driven by aortic valves and adoption of the recently launched tricuspid valve repair system. 
During the quarter, we announced positive clinical data from our COMMENCE, TRANSFORM and foundation studies at the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons meeting. These compelling new data on more than 2,000 patients provide important clinical evidence on the benefits of new surgical treatments, including our RESILIA tissue and INTUITY Elite valve system. We anticipate approval in the near future of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite about in the U.S. The system is built upon our proven pericardial valve technology and is designed to facilitate small incision aortic valve replacement surgery and streamline combination procedures. The U.S. launch will be deliberate and focused on adoption and ensuring excellent patient outcomes. The valve system underscores our ongoing commitment to developing innovative surgical technologies to address patient needs. We continue to invest in multiple surgical platforms as we believe that surgery will remain an important option for patients even as TAVR expands. 
In summary, given our first half results, we are reducing our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the full year to between 0 and 2%, and we expect a meaningful contribution to growth from the INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $142 million and grew 7% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products. And once again, we recorded double-digit underlying growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program. Our expansion of the U.S. sales teams also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Based upon the strong first half momentum, we are increasing our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to between 5% and 7% in 2016. 
In structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're in the process of implementing several enhancements, including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards' advanced issue. We plan to incorporate these enhancements as part of our first CE Mark trial, and we expect to begin treating patients soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, includes approximately 15 [ph] centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems. This single arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation. You'll hear more specific updates about this and other programs at future clinical meetings. 
In the legal matter that CardiAQ brought against Neovasc, our federal jury returned a $70 million verdict in our favor. The jury found that Neovasc, a former service provider, breached the nondisclosure agreement, misappropriated trade secrets and breached its duty of honest performance. 
During the quarter, we completed 2 small acquisitions that add future generation technologies to our transcatheter valves portfolio. We remain committed to developing innovative structural heart therapies, and although it's still early, we continue to believe that these therapies will ultimately benefit patients who are not well served today. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Scott"

This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of [ph] $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year, excluding the effects of foreign exchange in the prior year sales return reserve. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 33% versus prior year to $0.76, reflecting solid leverage. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 includes $34 million of acquired intellectual property related to early-stage transcatheter technologies as Mike mentioned earlier. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. 
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.3% compared to 74.3% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventory sold internationally and a reduced benefit from our FX hedge contracts. These were partially offset by a more profitable product mix, reflecting strong growth in THV and the impact of the THV return reserve in the prior year. As we mentioned last quarter, to accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are making significant investments in manufacturing capacity inside and outside the United States, including our new facility in Costa Rica. These capacity investments moderately reduced our gross profit margin in the second quarter and are likely to continue to have a negative impact into 2017. These impacts are reflected in our full year gross profit margin guidance, which remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items. 
Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% over the prior year to $229 million or 30.1% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year. 
Research and development expenses in the quarter increased 16% over the prior year to $113 million or 14.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales in the second half. 
During the second quarter, we recorded $9 million in intellectual property litigation expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific, where we now have multiple litigation matters in the United States and Europe. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, up from 20.7% in the prior year period. This increase was driven largely by the impact of our early-stage intellectual property acquisitions and our increased sales in the United States, our highest tax rate region. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items such as this quarter's intellectual property acquisitions, to be between 22% and 23%. 
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter sales by $5 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates boosted sales and favorably impacted earnings per share by $0.01 in the second quarter. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate an approximate $10 million favorable impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. Brexit has obviously contributed to the rate volatility, but the impact to our bottom line this year will likely be insignificant as most of the foreign exchange rate changes are expected to be offset by our hedging program. As a point of reference, U.K. sales represented less than 3% of our global sales last year. 
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $153 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $190 million less capital spending of $37 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. average affairs outstanding during the quarter were 217 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for full year 2016 of $216 million to $220 million. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Given our strong THV momentum and expectation of continuing growth, we are raising guidance for full year 2016 THV sales to be $100 million higher than we forecasted last quarter. We now expect THV sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and total Edwards sales to be at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million. And given the strong first half performance of Critical Care, we now expect sales within the range of $540 million to $580 million. 
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.78 and $2.88. And we continue to expect free cash flow, including special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
For the third quarter of 2016 at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $720 million and $760 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.62 and $0.68. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike"

In terms of raising the guidance, the transcatheter heart valve guidance by $100 million, it sounds like intermediate risk maybe coming a little bit earlier, u.S. and doing a little bit better, Japan doing a little bit better. Can you just kind of parse for us where you see that incremental transcatheter heart valve volume coming from, that $100 [ph] million?"

I'm wondering, we all have, Mike, our guesstimate with respect to how the market is bifurcated from extreme high risk, intermediate risk down to low risk. Some of the physicians that have published on it seems to think 60% or so in the low risk to intermediate, maybe 1/3, in high and extreme risk, maybe 10%. I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that at this point. Given the volumes, it would imply that we are seeing some risk creek. I know you get the question a lot, but it would imply that you are -- I guess, the underlying question is what sort of impact do you expect the intermediate risk approval to actually have, whether it be in terms of patient acquisition, new center development or anything else?"

Yes, I realized that it must be confusing for people that are following it. And part of it is that risk stratification happened by STS score and it traditionally been done that way. And over time here, we've seen that the risk scoring has changed, and it's changed in 2 ways. One, just the way that STS evaluates patients and their scoring system themselves and, the other is that heart teams themselves are playing a significant role in that, and you know that they're bringing in play factors like frailty and anatomy that aren't captured in risk score, so is certainly being a key component of that. So I think what you're seeing right now is just a different view of patients. They look at somebody today and say, boy, I consider them high risk for surgery, knowing the kind of results that they get with transcatheter heart valves. I believe they're largely staying on indication and the NCD reinforces that. But we just have less precise estimates of what high risk, intermediate risk and low risk means compared to what we've had in the past. We continue to believe that the overall TAVR opportunity is more than $5 billion by 2021, it were seeing that adoption. In terms of what's going to happen when intermediate is approved, I think a couple of things. We try to remind you that we're treating patients under the cap today, the Continued Access Program, and so that would stop when this began. And also, we tend to think that we'll see more of a ramp, if you will, a gradual wrap rather than a step function when that approval takes place. So that's our expectation."

That's also integrated with what's going on today  with a minimalist approach, which includes conscious sedation, shorter ICU stays. You don't have to coordinate with an anesthesiologist the way you used to and so forth, and those are truly adding capacity to the system. I think you broadly  are watching people share best practices and improve their efforts across the board."

When it comes to the impact on surgical valve, recall that we continue to have growth in aortic valves. They grew about 5% just this last quarter. So we have not changed our view that surgical valve business is going to grow in the face of TAVR expansion. And there are several factors. You've got aging global demographics working in your favor. Generally, undertreatment of patients, there's more innovations of high-value like INTUITY. You've got tissue to mechanical conversion nd the emerging markets are getting wealthier and able to treat their patients.

We are pleased with the adoption team in Japan following the launch of SAPIEN 3 earlier this year, and we expect Japan to be a strong contributor to long-term growth.
In Europe, we estimate total procedures grew around 25% in the second quarter compared to last year or approximately 20% when adjusted for additional selling days this year. Edwards procedures grew at about the same rate. While the PARTNER II data published in April was widely acknowledged, we do not
[Audio Gap]
provided a significant lift in the quarter. We saw strong procedure growth across nearly all countries and particularly strong growth in countries outside of Germany. While difficult to estimate, we believe more recent competitive entrants continue to account for about 15% of total European procedures.
As we mentioned, we're using our U.S. intermediate risk data
[Audio Gap]
an expansion of our CE Mark indication. These data were submitted to European regulators during the quarter, and we continue to expect approval of an expanded label in late 2016 or early 2017. We expect gradual expansion into intermediate-risk patients when the label is broadened and clinical guidelines are revised.
Our updated guidance anticipates that OUS sales may reflect a negative impact in the fourth quarter. The country of France has a policy that limits annual TAVR procedures. Strong therapy adoption there is outpacing this year's rate. We are working with the Ministry of Health in an effort to increase the procedure limit. In the absence of a resolution, we expect to discontinue sales in France for the remainder of 2016 when the cap is reached, and this assumption is reflected in our guidance.
Given the strong performance of SAPIEN 3, we have decided to incorporate additional benefits into our new Ultra system before its introduction. This will move the expected European launch to the second half of 2017. This new system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further possible -- further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.
Questions about transcatheter valve durability, which were first discussed during a EuroPCR presentation, were subsequently more thoroughly addressed at the TVT meeting last month. Physician presentations suggest that there's a lack of evidence that TAVR valve durability differs from surgical valves. Edwards has always distinguished itself on the best-in-class performance in heart valves, and we remain confident in our SAPIEN platform and are generating long-term follow-up data in our PARTNER trials.
In summary, based on our strong first half results, an anticipated third quarter approval of intermediate risk in the U.S. and momentum of global therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 30%.
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the second quarter were $199 million, a decrease of 3% over last year on an underlying basis. Sales of surgical mitral valves declined, which was partially offset by solid growth in surgical aortic valves. Globally, sales of our surgical mitral valves were impacted during the quarter due to our identification of a production matter related to the holder that assists surgeons during implantation of the valve, which caused us to temporarily suspend production. We have recently resumed shipping and expect a smaller impact in the third quarter as we replenish inventories.
Worldwide surgical aortic valve units grew approximately 5%, and global average selling price saw a slight decline due to regional mix. INTUITY Elite drove sales growth in Europe. And in Japan, growth was driven by aortic valves and the adoption of the recently launched tricuspid valve repair system. During the quarter, we announced positive clinical data from our COMMENCE, TRANSFORM and FOUNDATION studies at the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons meeting. These compelling new data on more than 2,000 patients provide important clinical evidence on the benefits of new surgical treatments, including our RESILIA tissue and INTUITY Elite valve system.
We anticipate approval in the near future of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve in the U.S. The system is built upon our proven pericardial valve technology and is designed to facilitate small incision aortic valve replacement surgery and streamline combination procedures. The U.S. launch will be deliberate and focused on adoption and ensuring excellent patient outcomes. The valve system underscores our ongoing commitment to developing innovative surgical technologies to address patient needs. We continue to invest in multiple surgical platforms as we believe that surgery will remain an important option for patients even as TAVR expands.
In summary, given our first half results, we are reducing our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the full year to between 0 and 2%, and we expect a meaningful contribution to growth from the INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S.
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $142 million and grew 7% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and once again, we recorded double-digit underlying growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program. Our expansion of the U.S. sales team also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Based upon the strong first half momentum, we are increasing our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to between 5% and 7% in 2016.
In structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're in the process of implementing several enhancements, including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards' advanced issue. We plan to incorporate these enhancements as part of our first CE Mark trial, and we expect to begin treating patients soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, includes approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems. This single arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation. You'll hear more specific updates about this and other programs at future clinical meetings.
In the legal matter that CardiAQ brought against Neovasc, our federal jury returned a $70 million verdict in our favor. The jury found that Neovasc, a former service provider, breached the nondisclosure agreement, misappropriated trade secrets and breached its duty of honest performance.
During the quarter, we completed 2 small acquisitions that add future generation technologies to our transcatheter valve portfolio. We remain committed to developing innovative structural heart therapies and although it's still early, we continue to believe that these therapies will ultimately benefit patients who are not well served today.
And with that, let me turn it over to Scott."
411220,374031482,1012912,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve. A",868,"Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 33% versus prior year to $0.76, reflecting solid leverage. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 includes $34 million of acquired intellectual property related to early-stage transcatheter technologies as Mike mentioned earlier. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.3% compared to 74.3% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventory sold internationally and a reduced benefit from our FX hedge contracts. These were partially offset by a more profitable product mix, reflecting strong growth in THV and the impact of the THV return reserve in the prior year.
As we mentioned last quarter, to accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are making significant investments in manufacturing capacity inside and outside the United States, including our new facility in Costa Rica. These capacity investments moderately reduced our gross profit margin in the second quarter and are likely to continue to have a negative impact into 2017. These impacts are reflected in our full year gross profit margin guidance, which remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items.
Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% over the prior year to $229 million or 30.1% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.
Research and development investments in the quarter increased 16% over the prior year to $113 million or 14.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales in the second half.
During the second quarter, we recorded $9 million in intellectual property litigation expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific, where we now have multiple litigation matters in the United States and Europe.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, up from 20.7% in the prior year period. This increase was driven largely by the impact of our early-stage intellectual property acquisitions and our increased sales in the United States, our highest tax rate region. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items such as this quarter's intellectual property acquisitions, to be between 22% and 23%.
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter sales by $5 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates boosted sales and favorably impacted earnings per share by $0.01 in the second quarter. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate an approximate $10 million favorable impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. Brexit has obviously contributed to rate volatility, but the impact to our bottom line this year will likely be insignificant as most of the foreign exchange rate changes are expected to be offset by our hedging program. As a point of reference, U.K. sales represented less than 3% of our global sales last year.
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $153 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $190 million less capital spending of $37 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 217 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for full year 2016 of 216 million to 220 million.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Given our strong THV momentum and expectation of continuing growth, we are raising guidance for full year 2016 THV sales to be $100 million higher than we forecasted last quarter. We now expect THV sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and total Edwards sales to be at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million. And given the strong first half performance of Critical Care, we now expect sales within the range of $540 million to $580 million.
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.78 and $2.88. And we continue to expect free cash flow, including special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million.

I'm wondering, we all have, Mike, our guesstimates with respect to how the market is bifurcated from extreme high risk, intermediate risk down to low risk. Some of the physicians that have published on it seem to think 60% or so in the low risk; intermediate, maybe 1/3; and high and extreme risk, maybe 10%. I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that at this point. Given the volumes, it would imply that we are seeing some risk creep. I know you get the question a lot, but it would imply that you are. Just, I guess, the underlying question is what sort of impact do you expect the intermediate risk approval to actually have, whether it be in terms of patient acquisition, new center development or anything else?"

Yes, I realized that it must be confusing for people that are following it, and part of it is that risk stratification happened by STS score and it's traditionally been done that way. And over time here, we've seen that risk scoring has changed, and it's changed in 2 ways. One, just the way that STS evaluates patients with their scoring system themselves; and the other is that heart teams themselves are playing a significant role in that, and you know that they're bringing in play factors like frailty and anatomy that aren't captured in risk score, so age certainly being a key component of that. So I think what you're seeing right now is just a different view of patients. They look at somebody today and say, ""Boy, I consider them high risk for surgery,"" knowing the kind of results that they get with transcatheter heart valves. I believe they're largely staying on indication. The NCD reinforces that. But we just have less precise estimates of what high risk, intermediate risk and low risk means compared to what we've had in the past. We continue to believe that the overall TAVR opportunity is more than $5 billion by 2021, and we're seeing that adoption. In terms of what's going to happen when intermediate is approved, I think a couple of things. We try to remind you that we're treating patients under the CAP today, the Continued Access Program, and so that would stop when this begin. And also, we tend to think that we'll see more of a ramp, if you will, a gradual ramp rather than a step function when that approval takes place. So that's our expectation."

In terms of the accounting change, we do plan to implement it in January 2017 as required by the accounting pronouncement. If we would've done it last year, our earnings per share would've been something like $0.17 higher than they were. But given the potential for all the variability and how this is calculated because it's based on our stock price and the option values that employee awards come with and how many of those options are exercised, it's risky to start making assumptions about what that's going to look like.

So we have not changed our view that surgical valve business is going to grow in the face of TAVR expansion, and there are several factors there. You've got the aging global demographics working in your favor. Generally, undertreatment of patients; there's more innovations of high value like INTUITY. You've got tissue to mechanical conversion, and the emerging markets are getting wealthier and able to treat their patients.

We are pleased with the adoption team in Japan following the launch of SAPIEN 3 earlier this year, and we expect Japan to be a strong contributor to long-term growth.
In Europe, we estimate total procedures grew around 25% in the second quarter compared to last year or approximately 20% when adjusted for additional selling days this year. Edwards procedures grew at about the same rates. While the PARTNER II data published in April was widely acknowledged, we do not

provided a significant lift in the quarter. We saw strong procedure growth across nearly all countries and particularly strong growth in countries outside of Germany. While difficult to estimate, we believe more recent competitive entrants continue to account for about 15% of total European procedures.
As we mentioned, we're using our U.S. intermediate risk data
[Audio Gap]
an expansion of our CE Mark indication. These data were submitted to European regulators during the quarter, and we continue to expect approval of an expanded label in late 2016 or early 2017. We expect gradual expansion into intermediate-risk patients when the label is broadened and clinical guidelines are revised.
Our updated guidance anticipates that OUS sales may reflect a negative impact in the fourth quarter. The country of France has a policy that limits annual TAVR procedures. Strong therapy adoption there is outpacing this year's rate. We are working with the Ministry of Health in an effort to increase the procedure limit. In the absence of a resolution, we expect to discontinue sales in France for the remainder of 2016 when the cap is reached, and this assumption is reflected in our guidance.
Given the strong performance of SAPIEN 3, we have decided to incorporate additional benefits into our new Ultra system before its introduction. This will move the expected European launch to the second half of 2017. This new system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further possible -- further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.
Questions about transcatheter valve durability, which were first discussed during a EuroPCR presentation, were subsequently more thoroughly addressed at the TVT meeting last month. Physician presentations suggest that there's a lack of evidence that TAVR valve durability differs from surgical valves. Edwards has always distinguished itself on the best-in-class performance in heart valves, and we remain confident in our SAPIEN platform and are generating long-term follow-up data in our PARTNER trials.
In summary, based on our strong first half results, an anticipated third quarter approval of intermediate risk in the U.S. and momentum of global therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 30%.
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the second quarter were $199 million, a decrease of 3% over last year on an underlying basis. Sales of surgical mitral valves declined, which was partially offset by solid growth in surgical aortic valves. Globally, sales of our surgical mitral valves were impacted during the quarter due to our identification of a production matter related to the holder that assists surgeons during implantation of the valve, which caused us to temporarily suspend production. We have recently resumed shipping and expect a smaller impact in the third quarter as we replenish inventories.
Worldwide surgical aortic valve units grew approximately 5%, and global average selling price saw a slight decline due to regional mix. INTUITY Elite drove sales growth in Europe. And in Japan, growth was driven by aortic valves and the adoption of the recently launched tricuspid valve repair system. During the quarter, we announced positive clinical data from our COMMENCE, TRANSFORM and FOUNDATION studies at the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons meeting. These compelling new data on more than 2,000 patients provide important clinical evidence on the benefits of new surgical treatments, including our RESILIA tissue and INTUITY Elite valve system.
We anticipate approval in the near future of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve in the U.S. The system is built upon our proven pericardial valve technology and is designed to facilitate small incision aortic valve replacement surgery and streamline combination procedures. The U.S. launch will be deliberate and focused on adoption and ensuring excellent patient outcomes. The valve system underscores our ongoing commitment to developing innovative surgical technologies to address patient needs. We continue to invest in multiple surgical platforms as we believe that surgery will remain an important option for patients even as TAVR expands.
In summary, given our first half results, we are reducing our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the full year to between 0 and 2%, and we expect a meaningful contribution to growth from the INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S.
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $142 million and grew 7% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and once again, we recorded double-digit underlying growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program. Our expansion of the U.S. sales team also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Based upon the strong first half momentum, we are increasing our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to between 5% and 7% in 2016.
In structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're in the process of implementing several enhancements, including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards' advanced tissue. We plan to incorporate these enhancements as part of our first CE Mark trial, and we expect to begin treating patients soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, includes approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems. This single arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation. You'll hear more specific updates about this and other programs at future clinical meetings.
In the legal matter that CardiAQ brought against Neovasc, a federal jury returned a $70 million verdict in our favor. The jury found that Neovasc, a former service provider, breached the nondisclosure agreement, misappropriated trade secrets and breached its duty of honest performance.
During the quarter, we completed 2 small acquisitions that add future generation technologies to our transcatheter valve portfolio. We remain committed to developing innovative structural heart therapies and although it's still early, we continue to believe that these therapies will ultimately benefit patients who are not well served today.
And with that, let me turn it over to Scott."
411220,374031482,1012974,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve. A",868,"Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 33% versus prior year to $0.76, reflecting solid leverage. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 includes $34 million of acquired intellectual property related to early-stage transcatheter technologies as Mike mentioned earlier. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.3% compared to 74.3% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventory sold internationally and a reduced benefit from our FX hedge contracts. These were partially offset by a more profitable product mix, reflecting strong growth in THV and the impact of the THV return reserve in the prior year.
As we mentioned last quarter, to accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are making significant investments in manufacturing capacity inside and outside the United States, including our new facility in Costa Rica. These capacity investments moderately reduced our gross profit margin in the second quarter and are likely to continue to have a negative impact into 2017. These impacts are reflected in our full year gross profit margin guidance, which remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items.
Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% over the prior year to $229 million or 30.1% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.
Research and development investments in the quarter increased 16% over the prior year to $113 million or 14.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales in the second half.
During the second quarter, we recorded $9 million in intellectual property litigation expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific, where we now have multiple litigation matters in the United States and Europe.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, up from 20.7% in the prior year period. This increase was driven largely by the impact of our early-stage intellectual property acquisitions and our increased sales in the United States, our highest tax rate region. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items such as this quarter's intellectual property acquisitions, to be between 22% and 23%.
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter sales by $5 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates boosted sales and favorably impacted earnings per share by $0.01 in the second quarter. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate an approximate $10 million favorable impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. Brexit has obviously contributed to rate volatility, but the impact to our bottom line this year will likely be insignificant as most of the foreign exchange rate changes are expected to be offset by our hedging program. As a point of reference, U.K. sales represented less than 3% of our global sales last year.
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $153 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $190 million less capital spending of $37 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 217 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for full year 2016 of 216 million to 220 million.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Given our strong THV momentum and expectation of continuing growth, we are raising guidance for full year 2016 THV sales to be $100 million higher than we forecasted last quarter. We now expect THV sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and total Edwards sales to be at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million. And given the strong first half performance of Critical Care, we now expect sales within the range of $540 million to $580 million.
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.78 and $2.88. And we continue to expect free cash flow, including special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. For the third quarter of 2016 at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $720 million and $760 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.62 and $0.68.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

I'm wondering, we all have, Mike, our guesstimates with respect to how the market is bifurcated from extreme high risk, intermediate risk down to low risk.

I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that at this point. Given the volumes, it would imply that we are seeing some risk creep. I know you get the question a lot, but it would imply that you are. Just, I guess, the underlying question is what sort of impact do you expect the intermediate risk approval to actually have, whether it be in terms of patient acquisition, new center development or anything else?"

Yes, I realized that it must be confusing for people that are following it, and part of it is that risk stratification happened by STS score and it's traditionally been done that way. And over time here, we've seen that risk scoring has changed, and it's changed in 2 ways. One, just the way that STS evaluates patients with their scoring system themselves; and the other is that heart teams themselves are playing a significant role in that, and you know that they're bringing in play factors like frailty and anatomy that aren't captured in risk score, so age certainly being a key component of that. So I think what you're seeing right now is just a different view of patients. They look at somebody today and say, ""Boy, I consider them high risk for surgery,"" knowing the kind of results that they get with transcatheter heart valves. I believe they're largely staying on indication. The NCD reinforces that. But we just have less precise estimates of what high risk, intermediate risk and low risk means compared to what we've had in the past. We continue to believe that the overall TAVR opportunity is more than $5 billion by 2021, and we're seeing that adoption. In terms of what's going to happen when intermediate is approved, I think a couple of things. We try to remind you that we're treating patients under the CAP today, the Continued Access Program, and so that would stop when this began. And also, we tend to think that we'll see more of a ramp, if you will, a gradual ramp rather than a step function when that approval takes place. So that's our expectation."

So that's one element that's stronger. And just the strength of the SAPIEN 3 data is putting us in a very favorable position as well and giving clinicians a lot of confidence. We were pleased with what's going on in Europe. We were glad to see the growth rate of Europe, the 20% and our growth tracked that. And we've had continued discussions with FDA that cause us to believe that we'll get the intermediate risk indication in the third quarter.

In terms of the accounting change, we do plan to implement it in January 2017 as required by the accounting pronouncement. If we would've done it last year, our earnings per share would've been something like $0.17 higher than they were. But given the potential for all the variability and how this is calculated because it's based on our stock price and the option values that employee awards come with and how many of those options are exercised, it's risky to start making assumptions about what that's going to look like.

We feel really good about intermediate risk, and we felt like we had some pretty spectacular results obviously that suggest that treatment with SAPIEN 3 is even better than surgery and so that part is very encouraging for us. But we know the practice of medicine has traditionally been slow to change and that that's going to take some time. So we more think in our minds that it's going to be a gradual but steady increase. It's -- we're yet to see if that really changes the total addressable market. We've always believed that we would have intermediate risk approval and that was in our more than $5 billion estimate that we put out there when we did our investor conference last time. When it comes to the impact on surgical valve, recall that we continue to have growth in aortic valves. They grew about 5% just this last quarter. So we have not changed our view that surgical valve business is going to grow in the face of TAVR expansion, and there are several factors there. You've got the aging global demographics working in your favor. Generally, undertreatment of patients; there's more innovations of high value like INTUITY. You've got tissue to mechanical conversion, and the emerging markets are getting wealthier and able to treat their patients. So all those factors, we think, are going to be ones that drive growth in surgery for a while."

Having said that, guideline changes are helpful in Europe, but they're also -- it's going to be somewhat dependent on what their decisions are on a country-by-country basis related to their reimbursement. In the U.S., probably the best guidance we have right now is what we just did for the quarter. As we try and project ahead and know exactly what clinicians will do, it's difficult for us to say. We hear a lot of positive messages, but we also believe that people are going to stay disciplined on indication and that heart teams are the ones that are really driving the therapy adoption at this point. So it's probably all the help that I can provide at this point."

[Audio Gap]
We are pleased with the adoption team in Japan following the launch of SAPIEN 3 earlier this year, and we expect Japan to be a strong contributor to long-term growth.
In Europe, we estimate total procedures grew around 25% in the second quarter compared to last year or approximately 20% when adjusted for additional selling days this year. Edwards procedures grew at about the same rates. While the PARTNER II data published in April was widely acknowledged, we do not
[Audio Gap]
provided a significant lift in the quarter. We saw strong procedure growth across nearly all countries and particularly strong growth in countries outside of Germany. While difficult to estimate, we believe more recent competitive entrants continue to account for about 15% of total European procedures.
As we mentioned, we're using our U.S. intermediate risk data
[Audio Gap]
an expansion of our CE Mark indication. These data were submitted to European regulators during the quarter, and we continue to expect approval of an expanded label in late 2016 or early 2017. We expect gradual expansion into intermediate-risk patients when the label is broadened and clinical guidelines are revised.
Our updated guidance anticipates that OUS sales may reflect a negative impact in the fourth quarter. The country of France has a policy that limits annual TAVR procedures. Strong therapy adoption there is outpacing this year's rate. We are working with the Ministry of Health in an effort to increase the procedure limit. In the absence of a resolution, we expect to discontinue sales in France for the remainder of 2016 when the cap is reached, and this assumption is reflected in our guidance.
Given the strong performance of SAPIEN 3, we have decided to incorporate additional benefits into our new Ultra system before its introduction. This will move the expected European launch to the second half of 2017. This new system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, is expected to enhance ease-of-use, further possible -- further reduce possible complications and shorten procedure time.
Questions about transcatheter valve durability, which were first discussed during a EuroPCR presentation, were subsequently more thoroughly addressed at the TVT meeting last month. Physician presentations suggest that there's a lack of evidence that TAVR valve durability differs from surgical valves. Edwards has always distinguished itself on the best-in-class performance in heart valves, and we remain confident in our SAPIEN platform and are generating long-term follow-up data in our PARTNER trials.
In summary, based on our strong first half results, an anticipated third quarter approval of intermediate risk in the U.S. and momentum of global therapy adoption, we are increasing our 2016 sales guidance by $100 million to between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. We now expect our underlying sales growth to exceed 30%.
Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group. Sales for the second quarter were $199 million, a decrease of 3% over last year on an underlying basis. Sales of surgical mitral valves declined, which was partially offset by solid growth in surgical aortic valves. Globally, sales of our surgical mitral valves were impacted during the quarter due to our identification of a production matter related to the holder that assists surgeons during implantation of the valve, which caused us to temporarily suspend production. We have recently resumed shipping and expect a smaller impact in the third quarter as we replenish inventories.
Worldwide surgical aortic valve units grew approximately 5%, and global average selling price saw a slight decline due to regional mix. INTUITY Elite drove sales growth in Europe. And in Japan, growth was driven by aortic valves and the adoption of the recently launched tricuspid valve repair system. During the quarter, we announced positive clinical data from our COMMENCE, TRANSFORM and FOUNDATION studies at the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons meeting. These compelling new data on more than 2,000 patients provide important clinical evidence on the benefits of new surgical treatments, including our RESILIA tissue and INTUITY Elite valve system.
We anticipate approval in the near future of our rapid deployment INTUITY Elite valve in the U.S. The system is built upon our proven pericardial valve technology and is designed to facilitate small incision aortic valve replacement surgery and streamline combination procedures. The U.S. launch will be deliberate and focused on adoption and ensuring excellent patient outcomes. The valve system underscores our ongoing commitment to developing innovative surgical technologies to address patient needs. We continue to invest in multiple surgical platforms as we believe that surgery will remain an important option for patients even as TAVR expands.
In summary, given our first half results, we are reducing our 2016 underlying sales growth expectation for the full year to between 0 and 2%, and we expect a meaningful contribution to growth from the INTUITY Elite launch in the U.S.
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $142 million and grew 7% on an underlying basis. Overall growth for the quarter was strong in our core products and once again, we recorded double-digit underlying growth in our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program. Our expansion of the U.S. sales team also stimulated stronger adoption of our market-leading products. Based upon the strong first half momentum, we are increasing our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to between 5% and 7% in 2016.
In structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our early generation CardiAQ Edwards platform, we're in the process of implementing several enhancements, including new delivery systems and utilizing Edwards' advanced tissue. We plan to incorporate these enhancements as part of our first CE Mark trial, and we expect to begin treating patients soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, includes approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems. This single arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation. You'll hear more specific updates about this and other programs at future clinical meetings.
In the legal matter that CardiAQ brought against Neovasc, a federal jury returned a $70 million verdict in our favor. The jury found that Neovasc, a former service provider, breached the nondisclosure agreement, misappropriated trade secrets and breached its duty of honest performance.
During the quarter, we completed 2 small acquisitions that add future generation technologies to our transcatheter valve portfolio. We remain committed to developing innovative structural heart therapies and although it's still early, we continue to believe that these therapies will ultimately benefit patients who are not well served today.
And with that, let me turn it over to Scott."
411220,374031482,1014381,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve. A",868,"Thank you, Mike. This quarter, the number of transcatheter procedures exceeded our estimates and drove total sales of $759 million, representing 21% growth over last year excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the prior year sales return reserve. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 33% versus prior year to $0.76, reflecting solid leverage. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 includes $34 million of acquired intellectual property related to early-stage transcatheter technologies as Mike mentioned earlier. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 73.3% compared to 74.3% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven primarily by the foreign exchange impact from inventory sold internationally and a reduced benefit from our FX hedge contracts. These were partially offset by a more profitable product mix, reflecting strong growth in THV and the impact of the THV return reserve in the prior year.
As we mentioned last quarter, to accommodate our increased sales demand going forward, we are making significant investments in manufacturing capacity inside and outside the United States, including our new facility in Costa Rica. These capacity investments moderately reduced our gross profit margin in the second quarter and are likely to continue to have a negative impact into 2017. These impacts are reflected in our full year gross profit margin guidance, which remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items.
Second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% over the prior year to $229 million or 30.1% of sales. This increase was driven primarily by sales and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year.
Research and development investments in the quarter increased 16% over the prior year to $113 million or 14.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be approximately 16% of sales in the second half.
During the second quarter, we recorded $9 million in intellectual property litigation expenses, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The expenses include litigation against Neovasc in the United States and with Boston Scientific, where we now have multiple litigation matters in the United States and Europe.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, up from 20.7% in the prior year period. This increase was driven largely by the impact of our early-stage intellectual property acquisitions and our increased sales in the United States, our highest tax rate region. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items such as this quarter's intellectual property acquisitions, to be between 22% and 23%.
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter sales by $5 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our April guidance, foreign exchange rates boosted sales and favorably impacted earnings per share by $0.01 in the second quarter. At current rates, which have been volatile, we now estimate an approximate $10 million favorable impact to full year 2016 sales compared to the prior year. Brexit has obviously contributed to rate volatility, but the impact to our bottom line this year will likely be insignificant as most of the foreign exchange rate changes are expected to be offset by our hedging program. As a point of reference, U.K. sales represented less than 3% of our global sales last year.
Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $153 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $190 million less capital spending of $37 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 217 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for full year 2016 of 216 million to 220 million.
Turning to our 2016 guidance. Given our strong THV momentum and expectation of continuing growth, we are raising guidance for full year 2016 THV sales to be $100 million higher than we forecasted last quarter. We now expect THV sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and total Edwards sales to be at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. We continue to expect sales for surgical heart valves within the range of $780 million to $820 million. And given the strong first half performance of Critical Care, we now expect sales within the range of $540 million to $580 million.
With today's increase in sales guidance, we now expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.78 and $2.88. And we continue to expect free cash flow, including special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. For the third quarter of 2016 at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $720 million and $760 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.62 and $0.68.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

I'm wondering, we all have, Mike, our guesstimates with respect to how the market is bifurcated from extreme high risk, intermediate risk down to low risk. Some of the physicians that have published on it seem to think 60% or so in the low risk; intermediate, maybe 1/3; and high and extreme risk, maybe 10%. I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that at this point. Given the volumes, it would imply that we are seeing some risk creep. I know you get the question a lot, but it would imply that you are. Just, I guess, the underlying question is what sort of impact do you expect the intermediate risk approval to actually have, whether it be in terms of patient acquisition, new center development or anything else?"

Yes, I realized that it must be confusing for people that are following it, and part of it is that risk stratification happened by STS score and it's traditionally been done that way. And over time here, we've seen that risk scoring has changed, and it's changed in 2 ways. One, just the way that STS evaluates patients with their scoring system themselves; and the other is that heart teams themselves are playing a significant role in that, and you know that they're bringing in play factors like frailty and anatomy that aren't captured in risk score, so age certainly being a key component of that. So I think what you're seeing right now is just a different view of patients. They look at somebody today and say, ""Boy, I consider them high risk for surgery,"" knowing the kind of results that they get with transcatheter heart valves. I believe they're largely staying on indication. The NCD reinforces that. But we just have less precise estimates of what high risk, intermediate risk and low risk means compared to what we've had in the past. We continue to believe that the overall TAVR opportunity is more than $5 billion by 2021, and we're seeing that adoption. In terms of what's going to happen when intermediate is approved, I think a couple of things. We try to remind you that we're treating patients under the CAP today, the Continued Access Program, and so that would stop when this began. And also, we tend to think that we'll see more of a ramp, if you will, a gradual ramp rather than a step function when that approval takes place. So that's our expectation."

I appreciate that. Scott, one for you with respect to the guidance. It looks like the TAVI upside that you generated, at least relative to consensus, on the top line gave you somewhere between 40% and 50% incremental margin to the operating income line just given the beat there relative to consensus. Whereas the guidance that you've given, $100 million increase in TAVI relative to the increase on the bottom line, would imply a much lower incremental margin for the balance of the year.

It's -- we're yet to see if that really changes the total addressable market. We've always believed that we would have intermediate risk approval and that was in our more than $5 billion estimate that we put out there when we did our investor conference last time. When it comes to the impact on surgical valve, recall that we continue to have growth in aortic valves. They grew about 5% just this last quarter. So we have not changed our view that surgical valve business is going to grow in the face of TAVR expansion, and there are several factors there. You've got the aging global demographics working in your favor. Generally, undertreatment of patients; there's more innovations of high value like INTUITY. You've got tissue to mechanical conversion, and the emerging markets are getting wealthier and able to treat their patients. So all those factors, we think, are going to be ones that drive growth in surgery for a while."

In the U.S., probably the best guidance we have right now is what we just did for the quarter. As we try and project ahead and know exactly what clinicians will do, it's difficult for us to say.

411220,404534591,1060752,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company with year-to-date sales growth rate up [ph] 20%, about doub",1345,"Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company with year-to-date sales growth rate up [ph] 20%, about double our original expected growth rate. This reflects continued strong global adoption of our SAPIEN 3 platform, which remains on track to generate over $300 million more in sales than we originally expected for the year. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to receive a number of important part of our approvals in each of our business units drive future growth. Consistent with our strategy, we are aggressively investing to bring breakthrough therapies to an even broader group of patients around the world. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global sales were $410 million, up 37% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S. and Japan. Globally, average selling prices were stable in each geographies. In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve sales for the quarter were $260 million and grew 55% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall, growth was consistent with our expectations with robust performance driven by continued strong procedure growth in both large and strong TAVR programs. 
As expected, in mid-August, we received FDA approval to expand the use of SAPIEN 3 for intermediate-risk patients, which is the first TAVR therapy to obtain this indication in the United States. The high-volume clinical sites already treating intermediate-risk patients are under our continued access protocol and they have now transitioned to commercial sales. 
Enrollment continues in our PARTNER III low-risk trial with more than 50 of our trial sites actively engaged. We believe this randomized trial should be enrolled by mid-2017 and we'll provide an update at our December investor conference. 
Outside of the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 15%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR in Japan with the rollout of SAPIEN 3 expected to be completed during the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, we saw strong procedure growth across the majority of countries. We estimate total procedures grew around 20% in the third quarter compared to last year. However, Edwards' growth rate was lower primarily due to reduced selling in France. We are pleased to be resolving the issue we described last quarter related to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016. Very strong therapy adoption caused the cap to be reached during the third quarter, earlier than expected. As a result, we reduced shipments in the third quarter, which impacted our sales by about $5 million. Fourth quarter will also be impacted as we have just now resumed shipments and expect to return to a near normal run rate by year-end. Our 2016 sales guidance reflects the current situation, and we are working toward a long-term resolution for 2017 and beyond. 
Also during the quarter, we received an intermediate risk indication for SAPIEN 3 in Europe. We continue to anticipate gradual expansion into these patients as clinical guidelines are revised and reimbursement policies are updated. We continue to expect that our new Ultra system featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology will be launched in Europe and the second half of 2017. We anticipate routine clinical updates on our SAPIEN platform at the upcoming TCT meeting. These include long-term PARTNER I data and quality-of-life data from PARTNER II. Although we anticipate an update on the CENTERA system, we expect a more robust data set at EuroPCR in 2017. 
In summary, based on our strong year-to-date results, we are reiterating our 2016 THV sales guidance of between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2016 underlying sales growth to exceed 30% as momentum of global therapy adoption remains strong. 
Turning to the surgical heart valves. Sales for the third quarter were $191 million and were flat compared to last year's results as mitral valves sales recovered and grew slightly, while aortic valve sales declined modestly. Globally, our ASP was slightly higher due to product and regional mix. We have addressed the surgical mitral valve production matter that affected us last quarter. Globally, sales are recovering as inventory's are being replenished. 
In the third quarter, global surgical aortic valve sales were soft, which we believe was due to the impact of TAVR, including a possible pent-up demand among U.S. intermediate-risk patients and a spillover effect from the mitral shortage. This quarter, we received 2 approvals for our innovative surgical valve platform designed for the future needs of patients requiring surgical interventions who are not indicated for transcatheter therapy. Our INTUITY Elite system was approved in the U.S. Clinician feedback from the initial implants has been positive, and we are positioning INTUITY Elite as a premium valve procedure and supporting it with the evidence of a strong value proposition. We also recently received the CE Mark for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves, the first in a new class of RESILIA heart valves that we expect to become our leading surgical valve platform globally. We are planning an initial introduction of INSPIRIS in Europe during the fourth quarter with the full launch expected in 2017. 
In summary, given our year-to-date results, we continue to expect 2017 underlying sales growth for the full year to be between 0 and 2%. Although we believe we are beginning to see -- although we are beginning to see the impact of TAVR, we expect our new product launches will lift our growth in 2017. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $138 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis. Our results were driven primarily by double-digit growth of our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program across most regions. As expected, growth was lower this quarter due to prior year comparisons. As announced previously, during the quarter, we received CE Mark for a key new technology, the acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ smart disposable. This system provides the first of its kind hypertension or low blood pressure probability indicator during hemodynamic monitoring. Both are planned for targeted commercial release in Europe this year with a full launch in 2017. Based on our year-to-date results, we are maintaining our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to be between 5% and 7% for 2016. 
In our structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our CardiAQ mitral valve replacement program, we are focused primarily on system enhancements and gaining clinical experience. Our clinical investigators believe that a less invasive transseptal approach will be preferred for treating patients suffering from mitral regurgitation and heart failure. During the first quarter, our investigators began treating patients with our improved transseptal delivery system in our U.S. early feasibility study. 
Our CE Mark trial is expected to begin soon. This trial called the RELIEF trial has been delayed due to more challenging regulatory processes that were anticipated for our most recent submission. As we indicated last quarter, the RELIEF trial is expected to include approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery system consistent with the desires of our clinicians. This single-arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation, and we expect clinical program update will be shared at scientific meetings in 2017. 
in our formal program, we have begun our CE Mark trial, the spacer trial, to evaluate this technology in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic, tricuspid valve regurgitation who have high risk for surgery. The FORMA device is a spacer placed within the native tricuspid valve designed to include valve performance and patient symptoms. The primary safety endpoint is 30 days with longer-term follow-up. We are also engaged in U.S. early feasibility study and expect the presentation at TCV -- at TCT next week on our compassionate use experience. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Another strong performance in transcatheter valve sales drove significant top line and bottom line growth this quarter versus the prior year. Our results were consistent with our guidance, which we raised 3 times this year as we delivered underlying sales growth of 18%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26%, reflecting significant leverage during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.65, which includes our customary adjustments for intellectual property litigation expenses and amortization of intangibles. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included in today's release. 
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.8% compared to 76.2% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven predominantly by the same foreign exchange factors that negatively impacted our gross margins in the first half of 2016. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter, and our full year 2016 gross profit margin guidance remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items. We expect gross margins to strengthen in 2017 as product mix improvement continues. We will discuss of those expectations at our investor conference in December. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. Third quarter expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $230 million or 31.1% of sales. This increase was driven by sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in transcatheter heart valves partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year. 
We have increased investments in structural heart initiatives with the benefit of this year's Medical Device Excise Tax suspension. R&D investments in the quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $113 million or 15.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our aortic and mitral transcatheter valve program. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 16% of sales in the fourth quarter. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 21.6% in the prior year period. This increase was driven by improved results in the U.S., our region with highest tax rate. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%. Starting in 2017, our tax rate will reflect the new accounting standard for employee stock option exercises. It is difficult to predict the impact given the uncertainty of these exercises and our stock price. Rather than simply reflecting the expected benefits of this accounting change in 2017, our intention is to provide adjusted earnings per share guidance that excludes this impact to facilitate transparent year-over-year comparisons. 
Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales by $8 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our July guidance, FX rates favorably impacted EPS by $0.01 in the third quarter. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $158 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $206 million less capital investments of $48 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.2 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 [ph] million, which is consistent with our assumption for the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance. For 2016, we are reiterating all of our full year sales guidance ranges. For transcatheter heart valves, we continue to expect sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. For surgical heart valves, we expect sales of $780 million to $820 million; and for Critical Care, we expect sales of $540 million to $580 million. For total, Edwards, we continue to expect sales at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. 
Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.82 and $2.92. And we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
For the fourth quarter 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $750 million and $790 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.77. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

Even though you had a very strong growth this quarter, I think people will look at the deceleration in the U.S. TAVR growth in Q3 versus Q2.

They've flipped over from doing clinical cases to do in commercial cases, and you should keep that in mind. And so that's probably the bigger picture. I don't know, if you're looking at global number, I think it's worth noting that France impacted us negatively. We entered around $5 million in the quarter.

We intentionally have not increased guidance for any of the business units or consolidated going into Q4. It's still growing very rapidly. I mean, you've got the company grew 20% in the first quarter, 21% in the second quarter, 18% in the third quarter. We've got TAVR growing in the U.S. at 55% compared to 60-some percent in Q2 and Q1. So we still feel really good about the growth. We still feel good about the market expansion opportunity. But no, we're not expecting any different range than what we've already talked about for TAVR for the company."

So it's going to be tougher for us to anticipate that anything could be presented that's going to suggest we would have to argue that we're going to take in less than 1%. So if that -- if there was some argument and there is that sound data, that will be interesting. But it's a pretty high hurdle for us to believe that that's an important part of future therapy."

For gross profit margin, this year's guidance was 73% to 74%. I think, we'll get a little bit of a lift from that in 2017. Keep in mind, we're still going to be investing in growing capacity and investing in our operations, but we should get a little bit of lift in our gross margin. For SG&A, we continue to drive. Expense is down, our guidance for the year was 30 to 32. This quarter, we came in at 31. I think, it's reasonable that we can continue to improve on SG&A. Again, these are -- this is going to be a slower improvement curve than what we achieved over the last 18 months when we went from the high 30s to the low 30s. But we're going to keep working on trying to drive efficiency in the back office and overhead expenses. On R&D, this year's R&D as a percentage of sales rate is probably a good assumption because if you think about ramping up the low-risk trial for TAVR and the investments we're making in our transcatheter mitral valve and other programs, that's probably a good indicator of where the spend should come in, in 2017. The other big one is just the tax rate and we're still puzzling what the tax rate forecast should look like. There's been upward pressure to the tune of 200 basis points this quarter. We're doing a lot of things internally to try to mitigate that upward pressure, but as we continue to grow in the U.S., something, we're going to continue to fight. So hopefully, that gives you some of the pushes and takes and we'll get more into the details in December."

It was very clear that said that intermediate patients did better with SAPIEN 3 than they did with surgery and we certainly know what the patient preference would be. So we think it's clear. It's just going to take some people time to work through their own thoughts and biases. Remember that surgeons broadly feel that they do a great job with these patients, and so they don't believe that the procedures are very dangerous and so forth. And so this is just part of the process of medicine going through change."

We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company, with year-to-date sales growth rate of 20%, about double o",1343,"Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company, with year-to-date sales growth rate of 20%, about double our original expected growth rate. This reflects continued strong global adoption of our SAPIEN 3 platform, which remains on track to generate over $300 million more in sales than we originally expected for the year. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to receive a number of important regulatory approvals in each of our business units to drive future growth. Consistent with our strategy, we are aggressively investing to bring breakthrough therapies to an even broader group of patients around the world. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global sales were $410 million, up 37% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies, with notable strength in the U.S. and Japan. Globally, average selling prices were stable in each geography. 
In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve sales for the quarter were $260 million and grew 55% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall, growth was consistent with our expectations, with robust performance driven by continued strong procedure growth in both large and small TAVR programs. 
As expected, in mid-August, we received FDA approval to expand the use of SAPIEN 3 for intermediate-risk patients, which is the first TAVR therapy to obtain this indication in the United States. The high-volume clinical sites already treating intermediate-risk patients are under our continued access protocol, and they have now transitioned to commercial sales. 
Enrollment continues in our PARTNER III low-risk trial, with more than 50 of our trial sites actively engaged. We believe this randomized trial should be enrolled by mid-2017, and we'll provide an update at our December investor conference. 
Outside of the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 15%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR in Japan, with the rollout of SAPIEN 3 expected to be completed during the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, we saw strong procedure growth across the majority of countries. We estimate total procedures grew around 20% in the third quarter compared to last year. However, Edwards' growth rate was lower, primarily due to reduced selling in France. We are pleased to be resolving the issue we described last quarter related to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016. Very strong therapy adoption caused the cap to be reached during the third quarter, earlier than expected. As a result, we reduced shipments in the third quarter, which impacted our sales by about $5 million. Fourth quarter will also be impacted as we have just now resumed shipments and expect to return to a near-normal run rate by year-end. Our 2016 sales guidance reflects the current situation, and we are working toward a long-term resolution for 2017 and beyond. 
Also during the quarter, we received an intermediate-risk indication for SAPIEN 3 in Europe. We continue to anticipate gradual expansion into these patients as clinical guidelines are revised and reimbursement policies are updated. We continue to expect that our new Ultra System, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in Europe and the second half of 2017. We anticipate routine clinical updates on our SAPIEN platform at the upcoming TCT meeting. These include long-term PARTNER I data and quality-of-life data from PARTNER II. Although we anticipate an update on the CENTERA system, we expect a more robust data set at EuroPCR in 2017. 
In summary, based on our strong year-to-date results, we are reiterating our 2016 THV sales guidance of between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2016 underlying sales growth to exceed 30% as momentum of global therapy adoption remains strong. 
Turning to the surgical heart valves. Sales for the third quarter were $191 million and were flat compared to last year's results, as mitral valves sales recovered and grew slightly, while aortic valve sales declined modestly. Globally, our ASP was slightly higher due to product and regional mix. We have addressed the surgical mitral valve production matter that affected us last quarter. Globally, sales are recovering as inventories are being replenished. 
In the third quarter, global surgical aortic valve sales were soft, which we believe was due to the impact of TAVR, including a possible pent-up demand among U.S. intermediate-risk patients and a spillover effect from the mitral shortage. This quarter, we received 2 approvals for our innovative surgical valve platforms designed for the future needs of patients requiring surgical interventions who are not indicated for transcatheter therapy. 
Our INTUITY Elite system was approved in the U.S. Clinician feedback from the initial implants has been positive, and we are positioning INTUITY Elite as a premium valve procedure and supporting it with the evidence of a strong value proposition. We also recently received the CE Mark for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the first in a new class of RESILIAn heart valves that we expect to become our leading surgical valve platform globally. We are planning an initial introduction of INSPIRIS in Europe during the fourth quarter, with the full launch expected in 2017. 
In summary, given our year-to-date results, we continue to expect 2016 underlying sales growth for the full year to be between 0 and 2%. Although we believe we are beginning to see -- although we are beginning to see the impact of TAVR we expect our new product launches will lift our growth in 2017. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $138 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis. Our results were driven primarily by double-digit growth of our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program across most regions. As expected, growth was lower this quarter due to prior year comparisons. As we announced previously, during the quarter, we received CE Mark for a key new technology, the Acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ smart disposable. This system provides the first of its kind hypotension or low blood pressure probability indicator during hemodynamic monitoring. Both are planned for targeted commercial release in Europe this year with a full launch in 2017. Based on our year-to-date results, we are maintaining our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to be between 5% and 7% for 2016. 
In our structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our CardiAQ mitral valve replacement program, we are focused primarily on system enhancements and gaining clinical experience. Our clinical investigators believe that a less invasive transseptal approach will be preferred for treating patients suffering from mitral regurgitation and heart failure. During the third quarter, our investigators began treating patients with our improved transseptal delivery system in our U.S. early feasibility study. 
Our CE Mark trial is expected to begin soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, has been delayed due to more challenging regulatory processes that were anticipated for our most recent submission. As we indicated last quarter, the RELIEF trial was expected to include approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems consistent with the desires of our clinicians. This single-arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation, and we expect clinical program updates will be shared at scientific meetings in 2017. 
in our FORMA program, we have begun our CE Mark trial, the spacer trial, to evaluate this technology in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic, tricuspid valve regurgitation who were at high risk for surgery. The FORMA device is a spacer placed within the native tricuspid valve designed improve valve performance and patient symptoms. The primary safety endpoint is 30 days, with longer-term follow-up. We are also engaged in a U.S. early feasibility study and expect the presentation at TCV -- at TCT next week on our compassionate use experience. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Another strong performance in transcatheter valve sales drove significant top line and bottom line growth this quarter versus the prior year. Our results were consistent with our guidance, which we raised 3 times this year as we delivered underlying sales growth of 18%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26%, reflecting significant leverage during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.65, which includes our customary adjustments for intellectual property litigation expenses and amortization of intangibles. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. 
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.8% compared to 76.2% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven predominantly by the same foreign exchange factors that negatively impacted our gross margins in the first half of 2016. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter, and our full year 2016 gross profit margin guidance remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items. We expect gross margins to strengthen in 2017 as product mix improvement continues. We will discuss those expectations at our investor conference in December. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. Third quarter expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $230 million or 31.1% of sales. This increase was driven by sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in transcatheter heart valves, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year. 
We have increased investments in structural heart initiatives with the benefit of this year's Medical Device Excise Tax suspension. R&D investments in the quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $113 million or 15.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our aortic and mitral transcatheter valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 16% of sales in the fourth quarter. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 21.6% in the prior year period. This increase was driven by improved results in the U.S., our region with highest tax rate. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%. Starting in 2017, our tax rate will reflect the new accounting standard for employee stock option exercises. It is difficult to predict the impact given the uncertainty of these exercises and our stock price. Rather than simply reflecting the expected benefit of this accounting change in 2017, our intention is to provide adjusted earnings per share guidance that excludes this impact to facilitate transparent year-over-year comparisons. 
Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales by $8 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our July guidance, FX rates favorably impacted EPS by $0.01 in the third quarter. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $158 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $206 million less capital investments of $48 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.2 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million,  which is consistent with our assumption for the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance. For 2016, we are reiterating all of our full year sales guidance ranges. For transcatheter heart valves, we continue to expect sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. For surgical heart valves, we expect sales of $780 million to $820 million; and for Critical Care, we expect sales of $540 million to $580 million. For total, Edwards, we continue to expect sales at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. 
Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.82 and $2.92. And we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
For the fourth quarter 2016,  at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $750 million and $790 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.77. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

Remember what we said about the continued access, switch it off so you had the 50, which in many cases, were the largest centers. They've flipped over from doing clinical cases to doing commercial cases, so you should keep that in mind. And so that's probably the bigger picture.

Is there any indication to you that anybody, anyone in the country is having an issue with respect to reimbursement for intermediate risk patients? Or categorizing intermediate risk patients? Is that at all having any impact on the penetration of that segment?"

Keep in mind, we're still going to be investing in growing capacity and investing in our operations, but we should get a little bit of lift in our gross margin. For SG&A, we continue to drive. Expense is down. Our guidance for the year was 30 to 32. This quarter, we came in at 31. I think, it's reasonable that we can continue to improve on SG&A. Again, these are -- it's going to be a slower improvement curve than what we achieved over the last 18 months when we went from the high 30s to the low 30s. But we're going to keep working on trying to drive efficiency in the back office and overhead expenses. On R&D, this year's R&D as a percentage of sales rate is probably a good assumption because when you think about ramping up the low-risk trial for TAVR and the investments we're making in our transcatheter mitral valve and other programs, that's probably a good indicator of where the spend should come in, in 2017. The other big one is just the tax rate and we're still puzzling what the tax rate forecast should look like. There's been upward pressure to the tune of 200 basis points this quarter. We're doing a lot of things internally to try to mitigate that upward pressure, but as we continue to grow in the U.S., it's something we're going to continue to fight.

And then, of course, we've been active repurchasers of our shares and we're going to continue to do that on an opportunistic basis to at least offset the dilutive effects of incentive compensation. And we'd like to continue to reduce the share count as well, which we've done here over the last several years. One of the big issues we're dealing with is we've got $1.2 billion in cash, but a lot of it is stranded outside of the U.S. And so that's cash that's not available for share repurchase, and that's something that we're going to continue to work on in terms of how we structure our assets and where we realize profits in cash around the world."

It's just going to take some people time to work through their own thoughts and biases.

We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company, with year-to-date sales growth rate of 20%, about double our original expected growth rate. This reflects continued strong global adoption of our SAPIEN 3 platform, which remains on track to generate over $300 million more in sales than we originally expected for the year. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to receive a number of important regulatory approvals in each of our business units to drive future growth. Consistent with our strategy, we are aggressively investing to bring breakthrough therapies to an even broader group of patients around the world. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global sales were $410 million, up 37% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies, with notable strength in the U.S. and Japan. Globally, average selling prices were stable in each geography. 
In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve sales for the quarter were $260 million and grew 55% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall, growth was consistent with our expectations, with robust performance driven by continued strong procedure growth in both large and small TAVR programs. 
As expected, in mid-August, we received FDA approval to expand the use of SAPIEN 3 for intermediate-risk patients, which is the first TAVR therapy to obtain this indication in the United States. The high-volume clinical sites already treating intermediate-risk patients are under our continued access protocol, and they have now transitioned to commercial sales. 
Enrollment continues in our PARTNER III low-risk trial, with more than 50 of our trial sites actively engaged. We believe this randomized trial should be enrolled by mid-2017, and we'll provide an update at our December investor conference. 
Outside of the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 15%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR in Japan, with the rollout of SAPIEN 3 expected to be completed during the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, we saw strong procedure growth across the majority of countries. We estimate total procedures grew around 20% in the third quarter compared to last year. However, Edwards' growth rate was lower, primarily due to reduced selling in France. We are pleased to be resolving the issue we described last quarter related to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016. Very strong therapy adoption caused the cap to be reached during the third quarter, earlier than expected. As a result, we reduced shipments in the third quarter, which impacted our sales by about $5 million. Fourth quarter results will also be impacted as we have just now resumed shipments and expect to return to a near-normal run rate by year-end. Our 2016 sales guidance reflects the current situation, and we are working toward a long-term resolution for 2017 and beyond. 
Also during the quarter, we received an intermediate-risk indication for SAPIEN 3 in Europe. We continue to anticipate gradual expansion into these patients as clinical guidelines are revised and reimbursement policies are updated. We continue to expect that our new Ultra System, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in Europe and the second half of 2017. We anticipate routine clinical updates on our SAPIEN platform at the upcoming TCT meeting. These include long-term PARTNER I data and quality-of-life data from PARTNER II. Although we anticipate an update on the CENTERA system, we expect a more robust data set at EuroPCR in 2017. 
In summary, based on our strong year-to-date results, we are reiterating our 2016 THV sales guidance of between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2016 underlying sales growth to exceed 30% as momentum of global therapy adoption remains strong. 
Turning to the surgical heart valves. Sales for the third quarter were $191 million and were flat compared to last year's results, as mitral valves sales recovered and grew slightly, while aortic valve sales declined modestly. Globally, our ASP was slightly higher due to product and regional mix. We have addressed the surgical mitral valve production matter that affected us last quarter. Globally, sales are recovering as inventories are being replenished. 
In the third quarter, global surgical aortic valve sales were soft, which we believe was due to the impact of TAVR, including a possible pent-up demand among U.S. intermediate-risk patients and a spillover effect from the mitral shortage. This quarter, we received 2 approvals for our innovative surgical valve platforms designed for the future needs of patients requiring surgical interventions who are not indicated for transcatheter therapy. 
Our INTUITY Elite system was approved in the U.S. Clinician feedback from the initial implants has been positive, and we are positioning INTUITY Elite as a premium valve procedure and supporting it with the evidence of a strong value proposition. We also recently received the CE Mark for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the first in a new class of resilient heart valves that we expect to become our leading surgical valve platform globally. We are planning an initial introduction of INSPIRIS in Europe during the fourth quarter, with the full launch expected in 2017. 
In summary, given our year-to-date results, we continue to expect 2016 underlying sales growth for the full year to be between 0 and 2%. Although we believe we are beginning to see -- although we are beginning to see the impact of TAVR we expect our new product launches will lift our growth in 2017. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $138 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis. Our results were driven primarily by double-digit growth of our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program across most regions. As expected, growth was lower this quarter due to prior year comparisons. As we announced previously, during the quarter, we received CE Mark for a key new technology, the Acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ smart disposable. This system provides the first of its kind hypotension or low blood pressure probability indicator during hemodynamic monitoring. Both are planned for targeted commercial release in Europe this year with a full launch in 2017. Based on our year-to-date results, we are maintaining our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to be between 5% and 7% for 2016. 
In our structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our CardiAQ mitral valve replacement program, we are focused primarily on system enhancements and gaining clinical experience. Our clinical investigators believe that a less invasive transseptal approach will be preferred for treating patients suffering from mitral regurgitation and heart failure. During the third quarter, our investigators began treating patients with our improved transseptal delivery system in our U.S. early feasibility study. 
Our CE Mark trial is expected to begin soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, has been delayed due to more challenging regulatory processes than were anticipated for our most recent submission. As we indicated last quarter, the RELIEF trial was expected to include approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems consistent with the desires of our clinicians. This single-arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation, and we expect clinical program updates will be shared at scientific meetings in 2017. 
In our FORMA program, we have begun our CE Mark trial, the SPACER trial, to evaluate this technology in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic, tricuspid valve regurgitation who were at high risk for surgery. The FORMA device is a spacer placed within the native tricuspid valve designed to improve valve performance and patient symptoms. The primary safety endpoint is 30 days, with longer-term follow-up. We are also engaged in a U.S. early feasibility study and expect the presentation at TCV -- at TCT next week on our compassionate use experience. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Another strong performance in transcatheter valve sales drove significant top line and bottom line growth this quarter versus the prior year. Our results were consistent with our guidance, which we raised 3 times this year as we delivered underlying sales growth of 18%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26%, reflecting significant leverage during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.65, which includes our customary adjustments for intellectual property litigation expenses and amortization of intangibles. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. 
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.8% compared to 76.2% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven predominantly by the same foreign exchange factors that negatively impacted our gross margins in the first half of 2016. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter, and our full year 2016 gross profit margin guidance remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items. We expect gross margins to strengthen in 2017 as product mix improvement continues. We will discuss those expectations at our investor conference in December. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. Third quarter expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $230 million or 31.1% of sales. This increase was driven by sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in transcatheter heart valves, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year. 
We have increased investments in structural heart initiatives with the benefit of this year's Medical Device Excise Tax suspension. R&D investments in the quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $113 million or 15.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our aortic and mitral transcatheter valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 16% of sales in the fourth quarter. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 21.6% in the prior year period. This increase was driven by improved results in the U.S., our region with highest tax rate. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%. Starting in 2017, our tax rate will reflect the new accounting standard for employee stock option exercises. It is difficult to predict the impact given the uncertainty of these exercises and our stock price. Rather than simply reflecting the expected benefit of this accounting change in 2017, our intention is to provide adjusted earnings per share guidance that excludes this impact to facilitate transparent year-over-year comparisons. 
Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales by $8 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our July guidance, FX rates favorably impacted EPS by $0.01 in the third quarter. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $158 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $206 million less capital investments of $48 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.2 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million,  which is consistent with our assumption for the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance. For 2016, we are reiterating all of our full year sales guidance ranges. For transcatheter heart valves, we continue to expect sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. For surgical heart valves, we expect sales of $780 million to $820 million; and for Critical Care, we expect sales of $540 million to $580 million. For total, Edwards, we continue to expect sales at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. 
Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.82 and $2.92. And we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
For the fourth quarter 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $750 million and $790 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.77. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

And again, when you're thinking about market share -- we know that Europe grew at 20% this quarter, and we grew less than that. Remember, the impact of this situation in France is part of that, a big part of it."

Keep in mind, we're still going to be investing in growing capacity and investing in our operations, but we should get a little bit of lift in our gross margin. For SG&A, we continue to drive expenses down. Our guidance for the year was 30 to 32. This quarter, we came in at 31. I think, it's reasonable that we can continue to improve on SG&A. Again, these are -- it's going to be a slower improvement curve than what we achieved over the last 18 months when we went from the high 30s to the low 30s. But we're going to keep working on trying to drive efficiency in the back office and overhead expenses. On R&D, this year's R&D as a percentage of sales rate is probably a good assumption because when you think about ramping up the low-risk trial for TAVR and the investments we're making in our transcatheter mitral valve and other programs, that's probably a good indicator of where the spend should come in, in 2017. The other big one is just the tax rate and we're still puzzling what the tax rate forecast should look like. There's been upward pressure to the tune of 200 basis points this quarter. We're doing a lot of things internally to try to mitigate that upward pressure, but as we continue to grow in the U.S., it's something we're going to continue to fight.

And although we've done, I think, a reasonably good job of projecting the TAVR opportunity in the long term, it has been a challenge for us to predict actual quarters. Actually, we probably have done a better job predicting this quarter than we have over the recent past. But I don't have much more explanation than that. 
Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, David and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, back to you, David."

411220,404534591,1062018,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company, with year-to-date sales growth rate of 20%, about double o",1345,"Thank you, David. We're pleased to report strong third quarter underlying sales growth of 18%, which is consistent with our increased expectations. 2016 has been a remarkable year for our company, with year-to-date sales growth rate of 20%, about double our original expected growth rate. This reflects continued strong global adoption of our SAPIEN 3 platform, which remains on track to generate over $300 million more in sales than we originally expected for the year. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to receive a number of important regulatory approvals in each of our business units to drive future growth. Consistent with our strategy, we are aggressively investing to bring breakthrough therapies to an even broader group of patients around the world. 
In transcatheter heart valves, global sales were $410 million, up 37% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Growth was led by continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies, with notable strength in the U.S. and Japan. Globally, average selling prices were stable in each geography. 
In the U.S., transcatheter heart valve sales for the quarter were $260 million and grew 55% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Overall, growth was consistent with our expectations, with robust performance driven by continued strong procedure growth in both large and small TAVR programs. 
As expected, in mid-August, we received FDA approval to expand the use of SAPIEN 3 for intermediate-risk patients, which is the first TAVR therapy to obtain this indication in the United States. The high-volume clinical sites already treating intermediate-risk patients are under our continued access protocol, and they have now transitioned to commercial sales. 
Enrollment continues in our PARTNER III low-risk trial, with more than 50 of our trial sites actively engaged. We believe this randomized trial should be enrolled by mid-2017, and we'll provide an update at our December investor conference. 
Outside of the U.S., underlying THV sales grew 15%. We continue to be encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR in Japan, with the rollout of SAPIEN 3 expected to be completed during the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, we saw strong procedure growth across the majority of countries. We estimate total procedures grew around 20% in the third quarter compared to last year. However, Edwards' growth rate was lower, primarily due to reduced selling in France. We are pleased to be resolving the issue we described last quarter related to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016. Very strong therapy adoption caused the cap to be reached during the third quarter, earlier than expected. As a result, we reduced shipments in the third quarter, which impacted our sales by about $5 million. Fourth quarter results will also be impacted as we have just now resumed shipments and expect to return to a near-normal run rate by year-end. Our 2016 sales guidance reflects the current situation, and we are working toward a long-term resolution for 2017 and beyond. 
Also during the quarter, we received an intermediate-risk indication for SAPIEN 3 in Europe. We continue to anticipate gradual expansion into these patients as clinical guidelines are revised and reimbursement policies are updated. We continue to expect that our new Ultra System, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in Europe and the second half of 2017. We anticipate routine clinical updates on our SAPIEN platform at the upcoming TCT meeting. These include long-term PARTNER I data and quality-of-life data from PARTNER II. Although we anticipate an update on the CENTERA system, we expect a more robust data set at EuroPCR in 2017. 
In summary, based on our strong year-to-date results, we are reiterating our 2016 THV sales guidance of between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2016 underlying sales growth to exceed 30% as momentum of global therapy adoption remains strong. 
Turning to the surgical heart valves. Sales for the third quarter were $191 million and were flat compared to last year's results, as mitral valves sales recovered and grew slightly, while aortic valve sales declined modestly. Globally, our ASP was slightly higher due to product and regional mix. We have addressed the surgical mitral valve production matter that affected us last quarter. Globally, sales are recovering as inventories are being replenished. 
In the third quarter, global surgical aortic valve sales were soft, which we believe was due to the impact of TAVR, including a possible pent-up demand among U.S. intermediate-risk patients and a spillover effect from the mitral shortage. This quarter, we received 2 approvals for our innovative surgical valve platforms designed for the future needs of patients requiring surgical interventions who are not indicated for transcatheter therapy. 
Our INTUITY Elite system was approved in the U.S. Clinician feedback from the initial implants has been positive, and we are positioning INTUITY Elite as a premium valve procedure and supporting it with the evidence of a strong value proposition. We also recently received the CE Mark for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the first in a new class of resilient heart valves that we expect to become our leading surgical valve platform globally. We are planning an initial introduction of INSPIRIS in Europe during the fourth quarter, with the full launch expected in 2017. 
In summary, given our year-to-date results, we continue to expect 2016 underlying sales growth for the full year to be between 0 and 2%. Although we believe we are beginning to see -- although we are beginning to see the impact of TAVR we expect our new product launches will lift our growth in 2017. 
In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $138 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis. Our results were driven primarily by double-digit growth of our Enhanced Surgical Recovery program across most regions. As expected, growth was lower this quarter due to prior year comparisons. As we announced previously, during the quarter, we received CE Mark for a key new technology, the Acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ smart disposable. This system provides the first of its kind hypotension or low blood pressure probability indicator during hemodynamic monitoring. Both are planned for targeted commercial release in Europe this year with a full launch in 2017. Based on our year-to-date results, we are maintaining our Critical Care underlying sales growth expectation to be between 5% and 7% for 2016. 
In our structural heart initiatives, we continue to make progress on our FORMA system for reducing tricuspid regurgitation and our CardiAQ Edwards transcatheter mitral valve platform. In our CardiAQ mitral valve replacement program, we are focused primarily on system enhancements and gaining clinical experience. Our clinical investigators believe that a less invasive transseptal approach will be preferred for treating patients suffering from mitral regurgitation and heart failure. During the third quarter, our investigators began treating patients with our improved transseptal delivery system in our U.S. early feasibility study. 
Our CE Mark trial is expected to begin soon. This trial, called the RELIEF trial, has been delayed due to more challenging regulatory processes than were anticipated for our most recent submission. As we indicated last quarter, the RELIEF trial was expected to include approximately 15 centers in Europe and Canada and will include transapical and transseptal delivery systems consistent with the desires of our clinicians. This single-arm study will include patients suffering from functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation, and we expect clinical program updates will be shared at scientific meetings in 2017. 
In our FORMA program, we have begun our CE Mark trial, the SPACER trial, to evaluate this technology in patients with clinically significant, symptomatic, tricuspid valve regurgitation who were at high risk for surgery. The FORMA device is a spacer placed within the native tricuspid valve designed to improve valve performance and patient symptoms. The primary safety endpoint is 30 days, with longer-term follow-up. We are also engaged in a U.S. early feasibility study and expect the presentation at TCV -- at TCT next week on our compassionate use experience. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Another strong performance in transcatheter valve sales drove significant top line and bottom line growth this quarter versus the prior year. Our results were consistent with our guidance, which we raised 3 times this year as we delivered underlying sales growth of 18%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26%, reflecting significant leverage during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.65, which includes our customary adjustments for intellectual property litigation expenses and amortization of intangibles. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. 
For the quarter, our gross profit margin was 72.8% compared to 76.2% in the same period last year. This decrease, which we expected, was driven predominantly by the same foreign exchange factors that negatively impacted our gross margins in the first half of 2016. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter, and our full year 2016 gross profit margin guidance remains unchanged at 73% to 74%, excluding special items. We expect gross margins to strengthen in 2017 as product mix improvement continues. We will discuss those expectations at our investor conference in December. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. Third quarter expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $230 million or 31.1% of sales. This increase was driven by sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in transcatheter heart valves, partially offset by the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax. We continue to expect SG&A, excluding special items, to be between 30% and 32% of sales for the full year. 
We have increased investments in structural heart initiatives with the benefit of this year's Medical Device Excise Tax suspension. R&D investments in the quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $113 million or 15.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our aortic and mitral transcatheter valve programs. We expect our R&D investments, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 16% of sales in the fourth quarter. 
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 21.6% in the prior year period. This increase was driven by improved results in the U.S., our region with highest tax rate. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 22% and 23%. Starting in 2017, our tax rate will reflect the new accounting standard for employee stock option exercises. It is difficult to predict the impact given the uncertainty of these exercises and our stock price. Rather than simply reflecting the expected benefit of this accounting change in 2017, our intention is to provide adjusted earnings per share guidance that excludes this impact to facilitate transparent year-over-year comparisons. 
Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales by $8 million compared to the prior year. Compared to our July guidance, FX rates favorably impacted EPS by $0.01 in the third quarter. Free cash flow generated during the quarter was $158 million. We define this as cash flow from operating activities of $206 million less capital investments of $48 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.2 billion. Total debt was approximately $600 million. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million, which is consistent with our assumption for the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Now turning to our 2016 guidance. For 2016, we are reiterating all of our full year sales guidance ranges. For transcatheter heart valves, we continue to expect sales of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. For surgical heart valves, we expect sales of $780 million to $820 million; and for Critical Care, we expect sales of $540 million to $580 million. For total, Edwards, we continue to expect sales at the high end of our $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. 
Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.82 and $2.92. And we continue to expect free cash flow, excluding special items, to be between $500 million and $600 million. 
For the fourth quarter 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, we project sales to be between $750 million and $790 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.77. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike."

So it's not unusual for us to be slow in July and August and for that to strengthen in September. And that's indeed the way the third quarter went. If we start looking around the country, we saw both large and small hospitals grow. Remember what we said about the continued access, switch it off so you had the 50, which in many cases, were the largest centers. They've flipped over from doing clinical cases to doing commercial cases, so you should keep that in mind. And so that's probably the bigger picture. I don't know, if you were looking at global numbers, I think it's worth noting that France impacted us negatively. We entered around $5 million in the quarter. So that may help with some of that as well."

Keep in mind, we're still going to be investing in growing capacity and investing in our operations, but we should get a little bit of lift in our gross margin. For SG&A, we continue to drive expenses down. Our guidance for the year was 30 to 32. This quarter, we came in at 31. I think, it's reasonable that we can continue to improve on SG&A. Again, these are -- it's going to be a slower improvement curve than what we achieved over the last 18 months when we went from the high 30s to the low 30s. But we're going to keep working on trying to drive efficiency in the back office and overhead expenses. On R&D, this year's R&D as a percentage of sales rate is probably a good assumption because when you think about ramping up the low-risk trial for TAVR and the investments we're making in our transcatheter mitral valve and other programs, that's probably a good indicator of where the spend should come in, in 2017. The other big one is just the tax rate and we're still puzzling what the tax rate forecast should look like. There's been upward pressure to the tune of 200 basis points this quarter. We're doing a lot of things internally to try to mitigate that upward pressure, but as we continue to grow in the U.S., it's something we're going to continue to fight.

We originally thought TAVR was going to be 10% to 18%. Now we know we're running 37% in third quarter. So there's a lot of tailwind to our growth rates.

One of the [indiscernible] these new innovations is reimbursement does end up stimulating demand because without reimbursement, it's just not as robust. So the French has a particular system in which they provide reimbursement before DRG goes in place and they've employed that on TAVR. And they sort of anticipate the number of procedures each year and have designed their system around that. What happened is TAVR grew so fast in 2016. It grew beyond their number and that's what created the situation. We're in pretty deep conversations with them, trying to help them understand the situation and the need of their patients. And so, I think, we've got -- we're hopeful that we have a resolution for 2016 that's pretty robust and we've engaged in conversations about 2017 and beyond. So it's productive, we're hopeful. But again, we'll keep you tuned in if there's new developments. But we're hopeful that we're going to be heading back toward normal."

You know that countries that have really good reimbursement tend to have heavier penetration rate. And I think, we've shown you some of the countries in Europe in the past where reimbursement is in place and well known. There is a higher penetration rate. Maybe that's something that we can highlight at our investor conference to sort of lay that out for you in terms of where reimbursement exists and where it doesn't. But generally, that's evolving as the therapy becomes proven. So generally, our dossiers are so strong on TAVR and its value proposition that, that situation is improving over time."

Now we have 3Q results that were very good on an absolute basis, but really didn't reflect a big new indication coming online the way investors may have been expecting. So how confident are you that the unexpected first half strength didn't include some pulling forward of demand within that intermediate risk cohort and that's why the inflection wasn't as sharp this quarter?"

And so we didn't really see a big difference between Q1 and Q2, so it's difficult to tell. We never expected a step function. We always expected a gradual increase. And although we've done, I think, a reasonably good job of projecting the TAVR opportunity in the long term, it has been a challenge for us to predict actual quarters. Actually, we probably have done a better job predicting this quarter than we have over the recent past. But I don't have much more explanation than that.
