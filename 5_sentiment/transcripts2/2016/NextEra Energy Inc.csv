Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 hi",5608,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 higher than the upper end of the range we discussed going into the year and up 8% from 2014. We also experienced double-digit growth in operating cash flow and continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. 
NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed the acceleration of its growth plan despite the challenges of difficult capital market conditions in the second half of the year, and grew its fourth quarter the submission per unit by 58% versus the comparable prior year quarter with a distribution of $0.3075 or $1.23 on an annualized basis. 
Before taking you through the field results, let me begin by summarizing some additional highlights. At Florida Power & Light, we continue to invest in the business in 2015 with a focus on delivering value to customers and all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. Since the last call, we received Florida PSC approval of the 2019 need for our planned Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We expect this project to further advance our focus on providing clean, reliable and cost-effective energy for our customers consistent with our long-term strategy. We continue to work hard at FPL to further enhance we consider to be an already outstanding customer value proposition.
Our customers enjoy electric service that is cleaner and more reliable than ever before while our typical residential customer bill is the lowest among reporting utilities in the state of Florida and is approximately 14% lower than it was a decade ago. Despite a challenging summer lightning season, FPL delivered its best ever full year period of service reliability in 2015 and was recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. This was accomplished as we continue to invest to make the grid stronger, smarter and more responsive and resilient to outage conditions.
Our performance is the direct result of our focused on operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and the long-term investments we've made to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do, and 2015 was an excellent period of execution by the FPL team.
At Energy Resources, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for our contracted renewables development program. New renewables project additions drove financial results while origination results for new projects to be placed into service by the end of 2016 exceeded the expectations that we discussed at our March investor conference. The longer-term outlook beyond 2016 also continue to develop favorably. The team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects over the last year, making this our second best year ever for renewables originations performance.
We continue to believe that Energy Resources is well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. We now have greater certainty regarding federal tax incentives for renewables as Congress took action in December to extend the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase down period. We expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance with a 2-year safe harbor period for wind and solar somewhere informed what was put in place for the 2014 PTC.
The certainty regarding tax incentives will provide planning instability which we think, in turn, will serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with combined cycle technology when tax incentives are phased down.
In the meantime, with tax incentives, both wind and solar will be very competitive. And in addition to the favorable impact of tax policy, we expect the carbon reduction requirements under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to significantly drive demand for new renewables as we move into the next decade. 
Finally, we expect low natural gas prices to continue to force coal to gas and the coal to renewable switching with new renewables supported by the factors I just mentioned.
Driven in large part by our enthusiasm about our renewables growth prospects, in the middle of last year, we increased our expectations for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base. These increased expectation will, in turn, affect our capital expenditure plans for renewables development program which we will update on the first quarter earnings call in April.
Across the portfolio, both Energy Resources and FPL continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil, nuclear and renewables generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with E4 or the equivalent forced outage rate at less than 1.5% for the full year.
Similar to NextEra Energy, NEP also delivered on our its financial expeditions. NEP grew its portfolio through the acquisition of economic interests and over 1,000 megawatts of contracted renewables projects from Energy Resources with total ownership increasing by over 1,200 megawatts and establishes presence from a long-term contracted natural gas pipeline space with the acquisition of 7 natural gas pipelines in Texas. This acquisition is expected to reduce the impact resource variability as in the portfolio and extend NEP's runway of potential dropdown assets.
All of the same factors that favor growth in new renewables for Energy Resources likewise should benefit NEP. The strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners now and in the future. In contrast to many other yieldcos, NEP does not have the same dependence on third-party acquisitions to grow, but rather can reasonably expect to acquire projects that have been organically developed by its best-in-class sponsor.
We continue to believe that the strength of its sponsor and the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth as a core strength of the NEP value proposition which is but 1 of many factors that distinguish it from other yieldcos. 
As we head into 2016, both NextEra Energy and NEP remain well positioned to deliver on their financial expectations subject to the usual drivers of variability including, in particular, renewable resource viability. FPL benefits from a surplus amortization balance of $263 million, which is expected to position it to earn at the upper half of its ROE range while it continues to execute on its capital investment initiatives for the benefit of customers.
In addition, the rate case will obviously be a core focus area for FPL in 2016. At Energy Resources, the business plan is built around the contribution from new investments and executing on the development and construction of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new renewables scheduled to go commercial by the end of the year. Meanwhile, NEP enters 2016 with a solid run rate and the flexibility necessary to execute its growth plans.
In summary, we are very optimistic about our prospects for another strong year.
Now let's look at our results for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $365 million or $0.79 per share, up $0.14 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2015, FPL reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.63 per share, up $0.18 per share versus 2014.
Regulatory capital employed grew 6.8% for 2015, which translated to net income growth of 8.6% for the full year with fourth quarter performance leading the way. Regular capital employed continue to grow through the year. In addition to being the first full quarter since the closing of the Cedar Bay transaction in September, fourth quarter results were also impacted by timing effects and a number of a smaller items, including outstanding performance under our asset optimization program.
As a reminder, FPL's current rate agreement provides an incentive mechanism for sharing with customers gains that we achieved in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities. In 2014, these activities produced roughly $67 million of incremental value. Of this amount, $54 million was for the benefit of Florida customers.
Under the sharing mechanism which only applies once customer savings exceed $46 million, FPL was permitted to record approximately $13 million of pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Consistent with the expectations that we shared with you previously, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended December 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined revelatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
During the fourth quarter, aided by the impact of unusually warm weather, we utilized only $67 million of reserve amortization. This brings our cumulative the utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 to $107 million, leaving us a balance of $263 million which can be utilized in 2016.
In 2016, we expect to use the balance of the reserve amortization to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations to support regulatory ROE in upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectation assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
Fourth quarter retail sales increased 11.7% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 9.6% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 2.1%, comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 0.7%.
As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to greater uncertainty in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons like we have seen throughout 2015.
For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6% compared to 2014. After adjusting for the effects of weather, full year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2%. Weather normalized underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. The economy in Florida continue to grow at a healthy rate with strong jobs growth reflected in consistently low rates of seasonally adjusted unemployment around levels last seen in early 2008, and over 1 million jobs have been added from the low in December 2009, though the pace jobs growth is beginning to slow. Leading indicators in the real estate sector continue to reflect the strong Florida housing market and the December reading the Florida's consumer sentiment remain close to postresession highs.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources beginning with our reporting change. We reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our natural gas pipeline investments and the management of these projects within our gas infrastructure activities at Energy Resources.
As you may recall, our upstream gas infrastructure activities have not only better informed our hedging positions but also the opportunities to gas reserves to benefit for the customers and the acquisition development and construction of natural gas pipelines. Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the Corporate & Other segment. While our 2014 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development. Contributions from the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP in October are also included in the Energy Resources results for 2015.
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $156 million or $0.34 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $185 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat against the prior year comparable period, which primarily reflects contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate G&A and interest expenses.
For the full year 2015, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $926 million or $2.04 per share.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EPS increased $0.14 per share despite a significant headwind associated with poor wind resource versus 2014, which was largely offset by strong results in our customer supply and trading business. This improved customer supply and trading results reflect in part a return to more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter following the adverse effects of polar vortex conditions in 2014. While wind resource was approximately 96% of the long-term average in 2015, other factors, including in particular icing in the fourth quarter and other production losses reduced production by another 2%.
New investments added $0.31 per share, consistent with the reporting change that I just mentioned. This includes $0.04 per share of contributions from our gas pipeline projects, reflecting the addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP to the portfolio as well as continued development work on the Florida pipeline at Mountain Valley project. New renewables investments added $0.27 per share, reflecting continued strong growth in our portfolio of contracted wind and solar projects. In 2015 alone, we commissioned approximately 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects and approximately 285 megawatts of new solar projects.
Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities which declined by $0.02 per share were negatively impacted by increased depreciation expenses as a result of higher depletion rates. Based on market conditions, we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in an earlier recognition of income should the value of hedges we had in place. Although this helped mitigate the negative FX in 2015, including higher depletion rates, below commodity price environment presents a challenge for these activities going forward.
Partially offsetting the growth from the business was a negative impact of $0.22 per share, reflecting higher interest in corporate expenses, including increased development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewables business. Results also were impacted by negative $0.06 per share of share dilution while benefiting from the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NEP. Additional details from results are shown on the accompanying slide.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 9%. Cash flow from operations excluding the impact of working capital increased approximately 14%. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources' adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for new wind and solar originations. Since our last earnings call, we have signed contracts for an additional 206 megawatts of wind projects for 2016 delivery. With these additions, we have exceeded the expectations we shared in our March 2015 investor conference for our 2015, 2016 development program. The company chart updates information were each of our programs now stands. We've also signed contracts in California and Ontario for storage projects to enter service in the next couple of years. Although it is early in the technology life cycle, we are successfully originating storage projects to support our expectations to invest up to $100 million per year in order to maintain our competitive position with regard to this important emerging technology.
For all the reasons I mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that the fundamental outlook for our renewables business has never been stronger, and we are working on an update to our capital expenditure expectations for our 2017 to 2018 develop a program. It is important to keep in mind that because of these projects drive growth upon entering commercial operation. The greatest potential benefits are to 2019 and beyond. For 2016, we believe that our development program is largely complete other than 1 or 2 additional opportunities that we are pursuing.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects that are now reported in the Energy Resources segment. The Florida pipelines remain on track and we expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval early this year to support construction beginning mid-2016 and unexpected in-service date at mid-2017. As a reminder NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be approximately $1 billion and $550 million, respectively and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process and filed its formal application in October 2015. We continue to see market interest in the pipeline and we're pleased to announce earlier this month the addition of consolidated Edison as a shipper on the line as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream as a partner. We continue to expect approximately 2 BCF per day, a 20-year firm capacity commitments achieved commercial operations by year-end 2018. With the addition of Con Edison, our ownership share in this project now stands at approximately 31% and our expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $135 million and cash available for distribution was $75 million. During the quarter, the assets in the NEP portfolio operated well. Overall, renewable resource was generally in line with our long-term expectations and the acquisitions of the Texas pipelines in Jericho Wind Farm were completed as planned. Overall 2015 was a successful year of execution against our growth objectives. Consistent with our decision to accelerate the growth of NEP, the portfolio grew throughout the year to support a fourth quarter the submission of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 58% against the 2014 comparable fourth quarter distribution.
Also consistent with the range of expectations that we have shared, full year adjusted EBITDA was approximately $404 million and cash available for distribution was $126 million.
Clearly, 2015 had its challenges as well. Changes in market conditions not only affected our financing plan in 2015 but also led us to pursue additional options to be more flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets going forward.
On the last call, we announced an aftermarket equity issuance or dribble program for up to $150 million at NEP. At the same time, NextEra Energy also announced a program to purchase from time to time based on market conditions and other considerations up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. During the quarter NEP completed the sale of over 887,000 common units, raising approximately $26 million under the ATM program.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $507 million or $1.10 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $530 million and $1.17 per share, respectively. For the full year 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.8 billion or $6.06 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.6 billion or $5.71 per share.
Our earnings per share results for the year account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June and September settlements totaling approximately 16 million shares associated with the equity units issued in 2012.
The impact of dilution on full year results was approximately $0.17 per share. The issuance of additional shares is consistent both with our strategy of maintaining a strong financial position and with our ability to grow adjusted EPS at 6% to 8% per year over a multiyear period.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.09 per share compared to 2014, primarily due to investment gains and the absence of debt retirement losses incurred in 2014.
NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impact of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition grew by 15% in 2015. And as expected, we maintained a strong credit position, which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital-intensive industry.
At FPL, we will continue to focus on excellent execution and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In addition, the rate case proceeding will be a core area of focus that is likely to occupy much of 2016 and I will discuss this more in just a moment. 
With regard to delivering on our customer value proposition and executing on our major capital initiatives at FPL, we will focus on completing our generation modernization project at Fort Everglades, constructing our peaker upgrades at Lauderdale and Fort Myers and delivering the 3 new large-scale solar projects and our other additional investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure.
At Energy Resources, growth will continue to come primarily through the addition of new renewables and continued construction of our gas pipeline projects, which we expect to more than offset PPC rolloff of approximately $37 million. We feel better than ever about the quality of our renewables development pipeline. And as we said in the last call, over the next few years, we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to our wind and solar origination and development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share for the growing North American renewables market.
Headwinds could come from the potential impact of El Niño on wind resource in the first half of the year and current weak commodity price environment. With regard to weak commodity prices, we evaluated our generation portfolio for markets where we expect low prices for sustained periods of time. As a result of that exercise, we took steps at the end of last year to reduce approximately 40% of our merchant generation capacity by entering into a contract to sell our natural gas fire generating assets located in ERCOT. Once closed, the sale is expected to be slightly accretive to our EPS and credit profile and will generate $450 million in net cash proceeds that will be recycled into our long-term contract the renewables business.
We remain well hedged through 2018 and we'll continue to evaluate our other merchant generating assets for potential capital recycling opportunities.
With regards to our upstream gas infrastructure business, sustained weak commodity prices, of course, means fewer new drilling opportunities, other things equal, and we have reduced our expectations of future growth from this part of the portfolio. When we elect to drill, we hedge most of our spec to gas and oil production for up to 7 years. In cases where we have elected not to drill, we have, as we did in the fourth quarter, liquidated the hedges that were put in place, which generally allows us to recover a portion of our original investment on those wells that we have planned to drill.
At the corporate level, we don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity. And if there would be a need, we would expect it to be modest. Similar to previous years, we will work to maintain a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities. Also as I just mentioned, we plan to evaluate capital recycling opportunities within our merchant generation portfolio as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated.
Earlier this month, we filed a test year letter with the Florida PSC to initiate a new rate proceeding for rates beginning in January 2017 following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. FPL is finalizing a base rate adjustment proposal that will cover the next 4 years of 2017 through 2020. While the details of the numbers are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $850 million starting in January 2017, $265 million starting in January 2018 and $200 million upon commission of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019 with no base rate adjustment in 2020. Based on these adjustments, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's current typical bill for January 2016 will grow at about 2.8%, roughly the expected rate of inflation through the end of 2020.
When thinking about the rate case, there are 4 key points to keep in mind. First, we are proposing a 4-year rate plan which provides customers a higher degree of predictability with regard to the future cost of electricity. Second, for the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest a total of nearly $16 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2018 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and continued delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other cost low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter grid and a cleaner more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers for higher service reliability and lower builds, we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investment supported by base rates.
Third, you may recall that FPL is required to file a comprehensive depreciation study as part of the rate case. The appreciation study to be filed with this rate case reflect the investments FPL has made since the last study in 2009. Based on the changing mix of assets and the recoverable lifespans, the resulting impact of the study is roughly a $200 million increase in annual depreciation expense.
Fourth, we expect to request a performance at or 0.5% as part of FPL's allowed regulatory ROE. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern coastal U.S., FPL has the cleanest carbon emissions rate, the most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability and the lowest customer builds, but in allowed ROE midpoint is below the average of those period utilities. We believe that the proposal for our performance presents an opportunity to reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage continued strong performance.
The estimated impact of the 3 base rate adjustments phased in during the 4-year period would total approximately $13 per month or $0.43 per day on the base portion of a typical residential bill. FPL is more targeted to deliver service that is ranked among the cleanest, the most reliable for the lowest cost and has made the decision to seek relief only after a thorough review of its financial projections. Since 2001, FPL's investments in high-efficiency natural gas energy have saved customers more than $8 billion on fuel, while preventing 95 million tons of carbon emissions. In addition, while the cause of many materials and products of the company was purchased in order to provide affordable reliable power have increased and the energy demand for Florida customers are growing with a projected addition of nearly 220,000 new service accounts during the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is focused on efficiency and productivity has significantly less in the bill impact.
Compared with the average utility's O&M cost, FPL's innovative practices and processes saved customers nearly $2 billion a year or approximately $17 per month for the average customer. Through its focus on cost reduction, FPL ranks best-in-class among major U.S. utilities for having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses, measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. 
In addition, while other utilities around the country are facing potentially higher costs to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan, FPL is already well positioned to comply with the targets in Florida. Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 20% lower than the state average and about 30% lower than the national average and we expect it will continue to be among the lowest in the way that it was 10 years and 2006, even with our requested base rate increases.
We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony to require detailed data in March. The timeline for the preceding will ultimately be determined by the commission but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter with the final commission decision in the fourth quarter and time for new rates to go into effect in January 2017.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request rate fair settlement. Over a period of the last 17 years, FPL has entered into a 5 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a degree of rate stability and certainty. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.
Turning now to expectations. For 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, applying the compound annual growth rate off of a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. We continue to expect to grow our dividend per share, 12% to 14% per year to at least 2018, off the 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impacts from the business of the recent facedown expression of bonus depreciation. Let me start by saying that we had already assumed the expansion of bonus depreciation in our 2016 financial expectations. In addition, after analyzing the recent expansion, we do not expect modest appreciation to impact NextEra Energy's earnings per share expectations through 2018.
At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday, the board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing the 58% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. From this base, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in the pediatrician as reasonable range of 4 expectations through 2020 subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit. The December 31, 2015, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million and CAFD of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at year end December 21, 2015. The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecast of portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
As we have said before, in the long run, in order for NEP to serve its purpose and the way to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. For 2016, beyond the ATM program, we continue to plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016 annual run rate. However, we will be smart, flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. If the equity markets are not accessible or reasonable prices, we expect to have sufficient that capacity at NEP that together with proceeds rates were at the market dribble program should be sufficient to finance currently planned 2016 transactions. Where conditions are appropriate, 1 alternative would be to raise equity of privately, pre-funding drops before they are publicly announced. However, this is just one option that we are considering and we may access the equity markets in other ways when market conditions permit. In addition, we expect our drops to be of smaller magnitude in order to manage the capital in order to finance acquisitions.
As I mentioned earlier, the aftermarket dribble program is proven to be successful as NEP raised approximately $26 million of equity during the fourth quarter and we will continue to seek opportunities to use this program to help finance potential future acquisitions. We continue to believe it is important that we remain focused on the fundamentals and given the strength of NEP's sponsor and the prospects for future renewables development, the NEP value proposition, which relies on projects again if we developed by Energy Resources rather than third-party acquisitions for growth is the best in the space.
We plan to continue to be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide time for a recovery of the equity markets. NEP benefits from a strong sponsor, derisk a long-term contracted cash flows with an average contract life of 19 years, strong counterparty credits and projects that, in many cases, haven't been financed predominantly a few mortgages and financing to provide long-term protection against interest rate volatility. We remain optimistic that the NEP financing model can and will work going forward. 
In summary, we have excellent prospects for growth. The environment for new renewables development has never been stronger and FPL, Energy Resources and NEP each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2015 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot of to execute in 2016, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
With that, we'll now open the lines for questions."

When we look at '17 through '20, we see a market that's probably much closer to owe 13 to 15 gigawatts, and there are some out there that would say that towards the latter part of the decade, that market could get up to 18 to 20 gigawatts. So when you look at it, we say, well, ""Gee, whereas we've gotten our fair share in the past and so our sufficiency is to continue to get our fear share in the future. And if you look at went on its own, and by the way, it's often very difficult to separate how much of that is going to be wind and how much of it is going to be solar, although I will tell you that solar is more and more competitive the longer you go out. But if you look at the near term, if you look at '17 and 18, on the wind side, certainly the expectations are that there's going to be an awful lot of wind build, right? Especially, if the IRS comes through, which we think they're going to come through the same interpretation of in-construction as they've had before, you're going to likely get 100% PTCs for CODs on wind all the way through the end of 2018. 2017 remains to be seen, whether that will be a banner year for wind or not but I think combined '17 and overeating, will be pretty good in the wind side. When you look at went a little further out, all BC of that CPP and we and others have provided comments that EPA on CPP, 1 of this comments that EPA ask for was, with diluted with a clean energy incentive program? Right? So right now, states have to have a state intimidation plan that could go in late as the fall of 2018. Before the plan goes in, you can't really get an under the incentive plan for renewables. So that's probably a 20 to 21 build that you see there, we're hoping that, that comes up a little bit. We do is CCB be making a difference for wind, probably starting in own 19 but certainly no later than 20. On the solar side, the way that it's been a structured, you could potentially get 30% ITC on solar all the way through 2020. We continue -- I've said this over and over again in the past, we continue to be surprised by the demand for solar out there it's certainly more competitive but there's a lot of demand for solar. So we see fairly steady solar growth from '18 through '20. I think it was Dane that asked the question before about '16, maybe go to '17, which I don't agree with what John said but the point there also on solar is, you may actually see a smaller '17 because so much is getting built in '16.

Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 hi",5599,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 higher than the upper end of the range we discussed going into the year and up 8% from 2014. We also experienced double-digit growth in operating cash flow and continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. 
NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed the acceleration of its growth plan despite the challenges of difficult capital market conditions in the second half of the year, and grew its fourth quarter distribution per unit by 58%, versus the comparable prior-year quarter with a distribution of $0.3075 or $1.23 on an annualized basis. 
Before taking you through the detailed results, let me begin by summarizing some additional highlights. At Florida Power & Light, we continued to invest in the business in 2015 with a focus on delivering value to customers, and all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. Since the last call, we received Florida PSC approval of the 2019 need for our planned Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We expect this project to further advance our focus on providing clean, reliable and cost-effective energy for our customers consistent with our long-term strategy. We continue to work hard at FPL to further enhance what we consider to be an already outstanding customer value proposition.
Our customers enjoy electric service that is cleaner and more reliable than ever before, while our typical residential customer bill is the lowest among reporting utilities in the state of Florida and is approximately 14% lower than it was a decade ago. Despite a challenging summer lightning season, FPL delivered its best ever full year period of service reliability in 2015 and was recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. This was accomplished as we continue to invest and make the grid stronger, smarter and more responsive and resilient to outage conditions.
Our performance is the direct result of our focus on operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and the long-term investments we've made to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do, and 2015 was an excellent period of execution by the FPL team.
At Energy Resources, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for our contracted renewables development program. New renewables project additions drove financial results, while origination results for new projects to be placed into service by the end of 2016 exceeded the expectations that we discussed at our March investor conference. The longer-term outlook beyond 2016 also continued to develop favorably. The team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects over the last year, making this our second best year ever for renewables origination performance.
We continue to believe that Energy Resources is well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. We now have greater certainty regarding federal tax incentives for renewables, as Congress took action in December to extend the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase down period. We expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance with a 2-year safe harbor period for wind and solar somewhere informed what was put in place for the 2014 PTC.
The certainty regarding tax incentives will provide planning stability, which we think, in turn, will serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with combined cycle technology when tax incentives are faced down.
In the meantime, with tax incentives, both wind and solar will be very competitive. And in addition to the favorable impact of tax policy, we expect the carbon reduction requirements under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to significantly drive demand for new renewables as we move into the next decade. 
Finally, we expect low natural gas prices to continue to force coal to gas and coal to renewable switching with new renewables supported by the factors I just mentioned.
Driven in large part by our enthusiasm about our renewables growth prospects, in the middle of last year, we increased our expectation for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base. These increased expectations will, in turn, affect our capital expenditure plans for renewables development program, which we will update on the first quarter earnings call in April.
Across the portfolio, both Energy Resources and FPL continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil, nuclear and renewables generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with E4 or the equivalent forced outage rate at less than 1.5% for the full year.
Similar to NextEra Energy, NEP also delivered on all of its financial expectations. NEP grew its portfolio through the acquisition of economic interests and over 1,000 megawatts of contracted renewables projects from Energy Resources with total ownership increasing by over 1,200 megawatts and establishes presence in the long-term contracted natural gas pipeline space with the acquisition of 7 natural gas pipelines in Texas. This acquisition is expected to reduce the impact resource variability as in the portfolio and extend NEP's runway of potential dropdown assets.
All of the same factors that favor growth in new renewables for Energy Resources, likewise, should benefit NEP. The strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners now and in the future. In contrast to many other YieldCos, NEP does not have the same dependence on third-party acquisitions to grow, but rather can reasonably expect to acquire projects that have been organically developed by its best-in-class sponsor.
We continue to believe that the strength of its sponsor and the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth as a core strength of the NEP value proposition, which is but 1 of many factors that distinguish it from other YieldCos. 
As we head into the 2016, both NextEra Energy and NEP remain well positioned to deliver on their financial expectations, subject to the usual drivers of variability including, in particular, renewable resource viability. FPL benefits from a surplus amortization balance of $263 million, which is expected to position it to earn at the upper half of its ROE range, while it continues to execute on its capital investment initiatives for the benefit of customers.
In addition, the rate case will obviously be a core focus area for FPL in 2016. At Energy Resources, the business plan is built around the contribution from new investments and executing on the development and construction of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new renewables scheduled to go commercial by the end of the year. Meanwhile, NEP enters 2016 with a solid run rate and the flexibility necessary to execute its growth plans.
In summary, we are very optimistic about our prospects for another strong year.
Now let's look at our results for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $365 million or $0.79 per share, up $0.14 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2015, FPL reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.63 per share, up $0.18 per share versus 2014.
Regulatory capital employed grew 6.8% for 2015, which translated to net income growth of 8.6% for the full year with fourth quarter performance leading the way. Regulatory capital employed continued to grow through the year. In addition to being the first full quarter since the closing of the Cedar Bay transaction in September, fourth quarter results were also impacted by timing effects and a number of smaller items, including outstanding performance under our asset optimization program.
As a reminder, FPL's current rate agreement provides an incentive mechanism for sharing with customers gains that we achieved in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities. In 2014, these activities produced roughly $67 million of incremental value. Of this amount, $54 million was for the benefit of Florida customers.
Under the sharing mechanism, which only applies once customer savings exceed $46 million, FPL was permitted to record approximately $13 million of pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Consistent with the expectations that we shared with you previously, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended December 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
During the fourth quarter, aided by the impact of unusually warm weather, we utilized only $67 million of reserve amortization. This brings our cumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 to $107 million, leaving us a balance of $263 million, which can be utilized in 2016.
In 2016, we expect to use the balance of the reserve amortization to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance, along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations, to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
Fourth quarter retail sales increased 11.7% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 9.6% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 2.1%, comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 0.7%.
As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to greater uncertainty in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons like we have seen throughout 2015.
For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6% compared to 2014. After adjusting for the effects of weather, full year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2%. Weather normalized underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. The economy in Florida continue to grow at a healthy rate with strong jobs growth reflected in consistently low rates of seasonally adjusted unemployment around levels last seen in early 2008, and over 1 million jobs have been added from the low in December 2009, though the pace of jobs growth is beginning to slow. Leading indicators in the real estate sector continue to reflect a strong Florida housing market and the December reading Florida's consumer sentiment to remain close to postrecession highs.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with our reporting change. We reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our natural gas pipeline investments and the management of these projects within our gas infrastructure activities at Energy Resources.
As you may recall, our upstream gas infrastructure activities have not only better informed our hedging decisions, but have also led to opportunities and gas reserves to benefit for the customers and the acquisition development and construction of natural gas pipelines. Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the Corporate & Other segment. While our 2014 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development. Contributions from the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP in October are also included in the Energy Resources results for 2015.
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $156 million or $0.34 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $185 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat against the prior-year comparable period, which primarily reflects contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate G&A and interest expenses.
For the full year 2015, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $926 million or $2.04 per share.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EPS increased $0.14 per share, despite a significant headwind associated with poor wind resource versus 2014, which was largely offset by strong results in our customer supply and trading business. These improved customer supply and trading results reflect, in part, a return to more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter following the adverse effects of polar vortex conditions in 2014. While wind resource was approximately 96% of the long-term average in 2015, other factors, including in particular icing in the fourth quarter and other production losses reduced production by another 2%.
New investments added $0.31 per share, consistent with the reporting change that I just mentioned. This includes $0.04 per share of contributions from our gas pipeline projects, reflecting the addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP to the portfolio as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. New renewables investments added $0.27 per share, reflecting continued strong growth in our portfolio of contracted wind and solar projects. In 2015 alone, we commissioned approximately 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects and approximately 285 megawatts of new solar projects.
Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, which declined by $0.02 per share, were negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense as a result of higher depletion rates. Based on market conditions, we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in an earlier recognition of income through the value of the hedges we had in place. Although this helped mitigate other negative effects in 2015, including higher depletion rates, below commodity price environment presents a challenge for these activities going forward.
Partially offsetting the growth in the business was a negative impact of $0.22 per share, reflecting higher interest in corporate expenses, including increased development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewables business. Results also were impacted by negative $0.06 per share of share dilution while benefiting from the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NEP. Additional details of our results are shown on the accompanying slide.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 9%. Cash flow from operations excluding the impact of working capital increased approximately 14%. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources' adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for new wind and solar originations. Since our last earnings call, we have signed contracts for an additional 206 megawatts of wind projects for 2016 delivery. With these additions, we have exceeded the expectations we shared at our March 2015 investor conference for our 2015, 2016 development program. The company chart updates information on where each of our programs now stand. We've also signed contracts in California and Ontario for storage projects to enter service in the next couple of years. Although it is early in the technology life cycle, we are successfully originating storage projects to support our expectations to invest up to $100 million per year in order to maintain our competitive position with regard to this important emerging technology.
For all the reasons I mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that the fundamental outlook for our renewables business has never been stronger, and we are working on an update to our capital expenditure expectations for our 2017 to 2018 development program. It is important to keep in mind that because these projects drive growth upon entering commercial operation, the greatest potential benefits are to 2019 and beyond. For 2016, we believe that our development program is largely complete other than 1 or 2 additional opportunities that we are pursuing.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects that are now reported in the Energy Resources segment. The Florida pipelines remain on track, and we expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval early this year to support construction beginning in mid-2016 and an expected in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be approximately $1 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process and filed its formal application in October 2015. We continue to see market interest in the pipeline, and we're pleased to announce earlier this month the addition of consolidated Edison as a shipper on the line as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream as a partner. We continue to expect approximately 2 BCF per day, a 20-year firm capacity commitments, to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. With the addition of Con Edison, our ownership share in this project now stands at approximately 31% and our expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $135 million, and cash available for distribution was $75 million. During the quarter, the assets in the NEP portfolio operated well. Overall renewable resource was generally in line with our long-term expectations, and the acquisitions of the Texas pipelines in Jericho Wind Farm were completed as planned. Overall, 2015 was a successful year of execution against our growth objectives. Consistent with our decision to accelerate the growth of NEP, the portfolio grew throughout the year to support a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 58% against the 2014 comparable fourth quarter distribution.
Also consistent with the range of expectations that we have shared, full year adjusted EBITDA was approximately $404 million, and cash available for distribution was $126 million.
Clearly, 2015 had its challenges as well. Changes in market conditions not only affected our financing plan in 2015, but also led us to pursue additional options to be more flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets going forward.
On the last call, we announced an aftermarket equity issuance or dribble program for up to $150 million at NEP. At the same time, NextEra Energy also announced a program to purchase from time to time based on market conditions and other considerations up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. During the quarter, NEP completed the sale of over 887,000 common units, raising approximately $26 million under the ATM program.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $507 million or $1.10 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $530 million and $1.17 per share, respectively. For the full year 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.8 billion or $6.06 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.6 billion or $5.71 per share.
Our earnings per share results for the year account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June and September settlements totaling approximately 16 million shares, associated with the equity units issued in 2012.
The impact of dilution on full year results was approximately $0.17 per share. The issuance of additional shares is consistent both with our strategy of maintaining a strong financial position and with our ability to grow adjusted EPS at 6% to 8% per year over a multiyear period.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.09 per share compared to 2014, primarily due to investment gains and the absence of debt retirement losses incurred in 2014.
NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition grew by 16% in 2015. And as expected, we maintain a strong credit position, which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital-intensive industry.
At FPL, we will continue to focus on excellent execution and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In addition, the rate case proceeding will be a core area of focus that is likely to occupy much of 2016, and I will discuss this more in just a moment. 
With regard to delivering on our customer value proposition and executing on our major capital initiatives at FPL, we will focus on completing our generation modernization project at Port Everglades, constructing our peaker upgrades at Lauderdale and Fort Myers and delivering the 3 new large-scale solar projects and our other additional investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure.
At Energy Resources, growth will continue to come primarily through the addition of new renewables and continued construction of our gas pipeline projects, which we expect to more than offset PPC roll-off of approximately $37 million. We feel better than ever about the quality of our renewables development pipeline. And as we said in the last call, over the next few years, we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to our wind and solar origination and development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of the growing North American renewables market.
Headwinds could come from the potential impact of El Niño on wind resource in the first half of the year and current weak commodity price environment. With regard to weak commodity prices, we evaluated our generation portfolio for markets, where we expect low prices for sustained periods of time. As a result of that exercise, we took steps at the end of last year to reduce approximately 40% of our merchant-generation capacity by entering into a contract to sell [indiscernible] natural gas fire-generating assets located in ERCOT. Once closed, the sale is expected to be slightly accretive to our EPS and credit profile and will generate $450 million in net cash proceeds that will be recycled into our long-term contract and renewables business.
We remain well hedged through 2018, and we'll continue to evaluate our other merchant-generating assets for potential capital recycling opportunities.
With regards to our upstream gas infrastructure business, sustained weak commodity prices, of course, means fewer new drilling opportunities, other things equal, and we have reduced our expectations of future growth from this part of the portfolio. When we elect to drill, we hedge most of our spec to gas and oil production for up to 7 years. In cases where we have elected not to drill, we have, as we did in the fourth quarter, liquidated the hedges that were put in place, which generally allows us to recover a portion of our original investment on those wells that we had planned to drill.
At the corporate level, we don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity. And if there would be a need, we would expect it to be modest. Similar to previous years, we will work to maintain a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities. Also as I just mentioned, we plan to evaluate capital recycling opportunities within our merchant generation portfolio as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated.
Earlier this month, we filed a test year letter with the Florida PSC to initiate a new rate proceeding for rates beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. FPL is finalizing a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2017 through 2020. While the details of the numbers are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $860 million starting in January 2017, $265 million starting in January 2018, and $200 million upon commission of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020. Based on these adjustments, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's current typical bill for January 2016 will grow at about 2.8%, roughly the expected rate of inflation through the end of 2020.
When thinking about the rate case, there are 4 key points to keep in mind. First, we are proposing a 4-year rate plan, which provides customers a higher degree of predictability with regard to the future cost of electricity. Second, for the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest a total of nearly $16 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2018 and beyond, to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter grid and a cleaner more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers for higher service reliability and lower builds, we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
Third, you may recall that FPL is required to file a comprehensive depreciation study as part of the rate case. The appreciation study to be filed with this rate case reflects the investments FPL has made since the last study in 2009. Based on the changing mix of assets and the recoverable lifespans, the resulting impact of the study is roughly a $200 million increase in annual depreciation expense.
Fourth, we expect to request a performance error of 0.5% as part of FPL's allowed regulatory ROE. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern Coastal U.S., FPL has the cleanest carbon emissions rate, the most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability and the lowest customer bills, but in allowed ROE midpoint that is below the average of those peer utilities. We believe that the proposal for our performance presents an opportunity to reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage continued strong performance.
The estimated impact of the 3 base rate adjustments phased in during the 4-year period would total approximately $13 per month or $0.43 per day on the base portion of a typical residential bill. FPL is more targeted to deliver service that is ranked among the cleanest, the most reliable for the lowest cost and has made the decision to seek relief only after a thorough review of its financial projections. Since 2001, FPL's investments in high-efficiency natural gas energy have saved customers more than $8 billion on fuel, while preventing 95 million tons of carbon emissions. In addition, while the cause of many materials and products of the company was purchased in order to provide affordable reliable power have increased and the energy demand for Florida customers are growing with a projected addition of nearly 220,000 new service accounts during the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is focused on efficiency and productivity has significantly lessened the bill impact.
Compared with the average utility's O&M cost, FPL's innovative practices and processes saved customers nearly $2 billion a year or approximately $17 per month for the average customer. Through its focus on cost reduction, FPL ranks best-in-class among major U.S. utilities for having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses, measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. 
In addition, while other utilities around the country are facing potentially higher costs to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan, FPL is already well positioned to comply with the targets in Florida. Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 20% lower than the state average and about 30% lower than the national average, and we expect it will continue to be among the lowest and lower than it was 10 years ago, in 2006, even with our requested base rate increases.
We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timeline for the preceding will ultimately be determined by the commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter, with the final commission decision in the fourth quarter and time for new rates to go into effect in January 2017.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate and request rate fair settlement. Over a period of the last 17 years, FPL has entered into a 5 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a degree of rate stability and certainty. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.
Turning now to expectations. For 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share, 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off the 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impacts from the business of the recent facedown expression of bonus depreciation. Let me start by saying that we had already assumed the expansion of bonus depreciation in our 2016 financial expectations. In addition, after analyzing the recent expansion, we do not expect bonus depreciation to impact NextEra Energy's earnings per share expectations through 2018.
At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday, the board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing a 58% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. From this base, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit. The December 31, 2015, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million and CAFD of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at year-end December 21, 2015. The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecast of portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
As we have said before, in the long run, in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose, we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. For 2016, beyond the ATM program, we continue to plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016, annual run rate. However, we will be smart, flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. If the equity markets are not accessible at reasonable prices, we expect to have sufficient debt capacity at NEP that together with proceeds rates were at the market dribble program should be sufficient to finance currently planned 2016 transactions. Where conditions are appropriate, one alternative would be to raise equity privately, pre-funding drops before they are publicly announced. However, this is just one option that we are considering, and we may access the equity markets in other ways when market conditions permit. In addition, we expect our drops to be smaller in magnitude in order to manage the capital required to finance acquisitions.
As I mentioned earlier, the aftermarket dribble program is proven to be successful, as NEP raised approximately $26 million of equity during the fourth quarter, and we will continue to seek opportunities to use this program to help finance potential future acquisitions. We continue to believe it is important that we remain focused on the fundamentals and given the strength of NEP's sponsor and the prospects for future renewables development, the NEP value proposition, which relies on projects organically developed by Energy Resources rather than third-party acquisitions for growth, is the best in the space.
We plan to continue to be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide time for recovery of the equity markets. NEP benefits from a strong sponsor derisk a long-term contracted cash flows with an average contract life of 19 years, strong counterparty credits and projects that, in many cases, have been financed predominantly through mortgage-style financing that provide long-term protection against interest rate volatility. We remain optimistic that the NEP financing model can and will work going forward. 
In summary, we have excellent prospects for growth. The environment for new renewables development has never been stronger and FPL, Energy Resources and NEP each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2015 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute in 2016, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
With that, we'll now open the lines for questions."

It's a bit lumpy though, as you know. When we look at '17 through '20, we see a market that's probably much closer to 13 to 15 gigawatts, and there are some out there that would say that towards the latter part of the decade, that market could get up to 18 to 20 gigawatts. So when we look at it, we say, well, ""Gee, [ph] always we've gotten our fair share in the past and so our expectation is to continue to get our fair share in the future."" If you look at wind on its own, and by the way, it's often very difficult to separate how much of that is going to be wind and how much of it is going to be solar, although I will tell you that solar is more and more competitive the longer you go out. But if you look at the near term, if you look at '17 and 18, on the wind side, certainly, the expectations are that there's going to be an awful lot of wind build, right? Especially, if the IRS comes through, which what we think they're going to come through the same interpretation of in-construction as they've had before, you're going to likely get 100% PTCs for CODs on wind all the way through the end of 2018. 2017 remains to be seen, whether that will be a banner year for wind or not, but I think combined '17 and '18 will be pretty good on the wind side. Then you look at wind a little further out, obviously, you've got CPP. We and others have provided comments to EPA on CPP. One of those comments that EPA asked for was, what do we do with the clean energy incentive program, right? So right now, states have to have a state implementation plan that could go in as late as the fall of 2018. Before that plan goes in, you can't really get it under the incentive plan for renewables. So that's probably a '20 to '21 build that you see there. We're hoping that, that comes up a little bit. We do see CPP making a difference for wind, probably starting in '19, but certainly no later than '20. On the solar side, the way that it's been structured, you could potentially get 30% ITC on solar all the way through 2020. We continue -- I've said this over and over again in the past. We continue to be surprised by the demand for solar out there. It's certainly more competitive, but there's a lot of demand for solar. So we see fairly steady solar growth from '18 through '20. I think it was Dan that asked the question before about '16, maybe go to '17, which I don't agree with what John said, but the point there also on solar is, you may actually see a smaller '17 because so much is getting built in '16. So is that good?"

There's always pressure on timing and that certainly FERC has been a little slower in terms of pipeline permitting that it's been historically, but we're feeling good about that. In terms of counterparty risk, obviously, we feel good with our portfolio projects that the vast, vast, vast majority of the counterparties that we have on all of our pipelines across both the Florida pipelines, Mountain Valley pipeline and the Texas pipelines are all very strong credit-worthy entities. And so we don't have that counterparty risk that some of the other folks in pipeline business do. And our average contract length is quite long, right? It's probably close to 20 years. So given where the market is at, obviously, there's a lot of distress in this market right now. We would have interest only in pipelines with strong credit counterparties and long-term contracts. And so if there are those that -- if there are those that become available and there may be some of those that come available given some of the things going on in the industry, we'll be interested in that. Obviously, we'll be disappointed, as we always are, vis-à-vis acquisitions, but it would be something that we would look at. But I have no interest in adding anything with commodity exposure and short contracts."

Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 hi",5602,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 higher than the upper end of the range we discussed going into the year and up 8% from 2014. We also experienced double-digit growth in operating cash flow and continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. 
NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed the acceleration of its growth plan despite the challenges of difficult capital market conditions in the second half of the year, and grew its fourth quarter distribution per unit by 58%, versus the comparable prior-year quarter, with a distribution of $0.3075 or $1.23 on an annualized basis. 
Before taking you through the detailed results, let me begin by summarizing some additional highlights. At Florida Power & Light, we continued to invest in the business in 2015 with a focus on delivering value to customers, and all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. Since the last call, we received Florida PSC approval of the 2019 need for our planned Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We expect this project to further advance our focus on providing clean, reliable and cost-effective energy for our customers, consistent with our long-term strategy. We continue to work hard at FPL to further enhance what we consider to be an already outstanding customer value proposition.
Our customers enjoy electric service that is cleaner and more reliable than ever before, while our typical residential customer bill is the lowest among reporting utilities in the state of Florida and is approximately 14% lower than it was a decade ago. Despite a challenging summer lightning season, FPL delivered its best-ever full year period of service reliability in 2015 and was recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. This was accomplished as we continue to invest and make the grid stronger, smarter and more responsive and resilient to outage conditions.
Our performance is the direct result of our focus on operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and the long-term investments we've made to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do, and 2015 was an excellent period of execution by the FPL team.
At Energy Resources, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for our contracted renewables development program. New renewables project additions drove financial results, while origination results for new projects to be placed into service by the end of 2016 exceeded the expectations that we discussed at our March investor conference. The longer-term outlook beyond 2016 also continued to develop favorably. The team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects over the last year, making this our second best year ever for renewables origination performance.
We continue to believe that Energy Resources is well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. We now have greater certainty regarding federal tax incentives for renewables, as Congress took action in December to extend the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase down period. We expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance with a 2-year safe harbor period for wind and solar somewhere informed what was put in place for the 2014 PTC.
The certainty regarding tax incentives will provide planning stability, which we think, in turn, will serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with combined cycle technology when tax incentives are phased down.
In the meantime, with tax incentives, both wind and solar will be very competitive. And in addition to the favorable impact of tax policy, we expect the carbon reduction requirements under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to significantly drive demand for new renewables as we move into the next decade. 
Finally, we expect low natural gas prices to continue to force coal to gas and coal to renewables switching, with new renewables supported by the factors I just mentioned.
Driven in large part by our enthusiasm about our renewables growth prospects, in the middle of last year, we increased our expectation for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base. These increased expectations will, in turn, affect our capital expenditure plans for our renewables development program, which we will update on the first quarter earnings call in April.
Across the portfolio, both Energy Resources and FPL continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil, nuclear and renewables generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with EFOR, or the equivalent forced outage rate, at less than 1.5% for the full year.
Similar to NextEra Energy, NEP also delivered on all of its financial expectations. NEP grew its portfolio through the acquisition of economic interests in over 1,000 megawatts of contracted renewables projects from Energy Resources, with total ownership increasing by over 1,200 megawatts and established its presence in the long-term contracted natural gas pipeline space with the acquisition of 7 natural gas pipelines in Texas. This acquisition is expected to reduce the impact resource variability has on the portfolio and extend NEP's runway of potential dropdown assets.
All of the same factors that favor growth in new renewables for Energy Resources likewise should benefit NEP. The strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners now and in the future. In contrast to many other yieldcos, NEP does not have the same dependence on third-party acquisitions to grow, but rather can reasonably expect to acquire projects that have been organically developed by its best-in-class sponsor.
We continue to believe that the strength of its sponsor and the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth is a core strength of the NEP value proposition, which is but one of many factors that distinguish it from other yieldcos. 
As we head into 2016, both NextEra Energy and NEP remain well positioned to deliver on their financial expectations, subject to the usual drivers of variability including, in particular, renewable resource variability. FPL benefits from a surplus amortization balance of $263 million, which is expected to position it to earn at the upper half of its ROE range, while it continues to execute on its capital investment initiatives for the benefit of customers.
In addition, the rate case will obviously be a core focus area for FPL in 2016. At Energy Resources, the business plan is built around the contribution from new investments and executing on the development and construction of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new renewables scheduled to go commercial by the end of the year. Meanwhile, NEP enters 2016 with a solid run rate and the flexibility necessary to execute its growth plans.
In summary, we are very optimistic about our prospects for another strong year.
Now let's look at our results for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $365 million or $0.79 per share, up $0.14 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2015, FPL reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.63 per share, up $0.18 per share versus 2014.
Regulatory capital employed grew 6.8% for 2015, which translated to net income growth of 8.6% for the full year, with fourth quarter performance leading the way. Regulatory capital employed continued to grow through the year. In addition to being the first full quarter since the closing of the Cedar Bay transaction in September, fourth quarter results were also impacted by timing effects and a number of smaller items, including outstanding performance under our asset optimization program.
As a reminder, FPL's current rate agreement provides an incentive mechanism for sharing with customers gains that we achieve in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities. In 2014, these activities produced roughly $67 million of incremental value. Of this amount, $54 million was for the benefit of Florida customers.
Under the sharing mechanism, which only applies once customer savings exceed $46 million, FPL was permitted to record approximately $13 million of pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Consistent with the expectations that we shared with you previously, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended December 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
During the fourth quarter, aided by the impact of unusually warm weather, we utilized only $67 million of reserve amortization. This brings our cumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 to $107 million, leaving us a balance of $263 million, which can be utilized in 2016.
In 2016, we expect to use the balance of the reserve amortization to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance, along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations, to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
Fourth quarter retail sales increased 11.7% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 9.6% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 2.1%, comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 0.7%.
As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to greater uncertainty in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons like we have seen throughout 2015.
For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6% compared to 2014. After adjusting for the effects of weather, full year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2%. Weather normalized underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. The economy in Florida continued to grow at a healthy rate, with strong jobs growth reflected in consistently low rates of seasonally-adjusted unemployment, around levels last seen in early 2008, and over 1 million jobs have been added from the low in December 2009, though the pace of jobs growth is beginning to slow. Leading indicators in the real estate sector continue to reflect a strong Florida housing market and the December reading of Florida's consumer sentiment remain close to post-recession highs.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with a reporting change. We have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our natural gas pipeline investments and the management of these projects within our gas infrastructure activities at Energy Resources.
As you may recall, our upstream gas infrastructure activities have not only better informed our hedging decisions, but have also led to opportunities and gas reserves to benefit Florida customers and the acquisition, development and construction of natural gas pipelines. Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the Corporate & Other segment. While our 2014 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development. Contributions from the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP in October are also included in the Energy Resources results for 2015.
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $156 million or $0.34 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $185 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat against the prior-year comparable period, which primarily reflects contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate G&A and interest expenses.
For the full year 2015, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $926 million or $2.04 per share.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EPS increased $0.14 per share, despite a significant headwind associated with poor wind resource versus 2014, which was largely offset by strong results in our customer supply and trading business. These improved customer supply and trading results reflect, in part, a return to more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter following the adverse effects of polar vortex conditions in 2014. While wind resource was approximately 96% of the long-term average in 2015, other factors, including in particular, icing in the fourth quarter and other production losses, reduced production by another 2%.
New investments added $0.31 per share, consistent with the reporting change that I just mentioned. This includes $0.04 per share of contributions from our gas pipeline projects, reflecting the addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP to the portfolio as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. New renewables investments added $0.27 per share, reflecting continued strong growth in our portfolio of contracted wind and solar projects. In 2015 alone, we commissioned approximately 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects and approximately 285 megawatts of new solar projects.
Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, which declined by $0.02 per share, were negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense as a result of higher depletion rates. Based on market conditions, we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in an earlier recognition of income through the value of the hedges we had in place. Although this helped mitigate other negative effects in 2015, including higher depletion rates, below commodity price environment presents a challenge for these activities going forward.
Partially offsetting the growth in the business was a negative impact of $0.22 per share, reflecting higher interest and corporate expenses, including increased development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewables business. Results also were impacted by negative $0.06 per share of share dilution while benefiting from the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NEP. Additional details for our results are shown on the accompanying slide.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 9%. Cash flow from operations excluding the impact of working capital increased approximately 14%. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources' adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for new wind and solar originations. Since our last earnings call, we have signed contracts for an additional 206 megawatts of wind projects for 2016 delivery. With these additions, we have exceeded the expectations we shared at our March 2015 investor conference for our 2015, 2016 development program. The accompanying chart updates information on where each of our programs now stand. We've also signed contracts in California and Ontario for storage projects to enter service in the next couple of years. Although it is early in the technology life cycle, we are successfully originating storage projects to support our expectations to invest up to $100 million per year in order to maintain our competitive position with regard to this important emerging technology.
For all the reasons I mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that the fundamental outlook for our renewables business has never been stronger, and we are working on an update to our capital expenditure expectations for our 2017 to 2018 development program. It is important to keep in mind that because these projects drive growth upon entering commercial operation, the greatest potential benefits are to 2019 and beyond. For 2016, we believe that our development program is largely complete other than 1 or 2 additional opportunities that we are pursuing.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects that are now reported in the Energy Resources segment. The Florida pipelines remain on track, and we expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval early this year to support construction beginning in mid-2016 and an expected in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be approximately $1 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process and filed its formal application in October 2015. We continue to see market interest in the pipeline, and we're pleased to announce earlier this month the addition of Consolidated Edison as a shipper on the line, as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream as a partner. We continue to expect approximately 2 BCF per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. With the addition of Con Edison, our ownership share in this project now stands at approximately 31% and our expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $135 million, and cash available for distribution was $75 million. During the quarter, the assets in the NEP portfolio operated well. Overall renewable resource was generally in line with our long-term expectations, and the acquisitions of the Texas pipelines and Jericho Wind Farm were completed as planned. Overall, 2015 was a successful year of execution against our growth objectives. Consistent with our decision to accelerate the growth of NEP, the portfolio grew throughout the year to support a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 58% against the 2014 comparable fourth quarter distribution.
Also consistent with the range of expectations that we have shared, full year adjusted EBITDA was approximately $404 million, and cash available for distribution was $126 million.
Clearly, 2015 had its challenges as well. Changes in market conditions not only affected our financing plan in 2015, but also led us to pursue additional options to be more flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets going forward.
On the last call, we announced an at-the-market equity issuance or dribble program for up to $150 million at NEP. At the same time, NextEra Energy also announced a program to purchase, from time to time based on market conditions and other considerations, up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. During the quarter, NEP completed the sale of over 887,000 common units, raising approximately $26 million under the ATM program.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $507 million or $1.10 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $530 million and $1.17 per share, respectively. For the full year 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.8 billion or $6.06 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.6 billion or $5.71 per share.
Our earnings per share results for the year account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June and September settlements, totaling approximately 16 million shares, associated with the equity units issued in 2012.
The impact of dilution on full year results was approximately $0.17 per share. The issuance of additional shares is consistent both with our strategy of maintaining a strong financial position and with our ability to grow adjusted EPS at 6% to 8% per year over a multiyear period.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.09 per share compared to 2014, primarily due to investment gains and the absence of debt retirement losses incurred in 2014.
NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition grew by 16% in 2015. And as expected, we maintain our strong credit position, which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital-intensive industry.
At FPL, we will continue to focus on excellent execution and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In addition, the rate case proceeding will be a core area of focus that is likely to occupy much of 2016, and I will discuss this more in just a moment. 
With regard to delivering on our customer value proposition and executing on our major capital initiatives at FPL, we will focus on completing our generation modernization project at Port Everglades, constructing our peaker upgrades at Lauderdale and Fort Myers and delivering the 3 new large-scale solar projects and our other additional investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure.
At Energy Resources, growth will continue to come primarily through the addition of new renewables and continued construction of our gas pipeline projects, which we expect to more than offset PTC roll-off of approximately $37 million. We feel better than ever about the quality of our renewables development pipeline. And as we said in the last call, over the next few years, we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to our wind and solar origination and development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of the growing North American renewables market.
Headwinds could come from the potential impact of El Niño on wind resource in the first half of the year and current weak commodity price environment. With regard to weak commodity prices, we evaluated our generation portfolio for markets where we expect low prices for sustained periods of time. As a result of that exercise, we took steps at the end of last year to reduce approximately 40% of our merchant generation capacity by entering into a contract to sell our Lamar and Forney natural gas fire-generating assets located in ERCOT. Once closed, the sale is expected to be slightly accretive to our EPS and credit profile and will generate $450 million in net cash proceeds that will be recycled into our long-term contract and renewables business.
We remain well hedged through 2018, and we'll continue to evaluate our other merchant-generating assets for potential capital recycling opportunities.
With regard to our upstream gas infrastructure business, sustained weak commodity prices, of course, means fewer new drilling opportunities, other things equal, and we have reduced our expectations of future growth from this part of the portfolio. When we elect to drill, we hedge most of our expected gas and oil production for up to 7 years. In cases where we have elected not to drill, we have, as we did in the fourth quarter, liquidated the hedges that were put in place, which generally allows us to recover a portion of our original investment on those wells that we had planned to drill.
At the corporate level, we don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity. And if there would be a need, we would expect it to be modest. Similar to previous years, we will work to maintain a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities. Also, as I just mentioned, we plan to evaluate capital recycling opportunities within our merchant generation portfolio as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated.
Earlier this month, we filed a test year letter with the Florida PSC to initiate a new rate proceeding for rates beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. FPL is finalizing a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2017 through 2020. While the details of the numbers are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $860 million starting in January 2017, $265 million starting in January 2018, and $200 million upon commission of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020. Based on these adjustments, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's current typical bill for January 2016 will grow at about 2.8%, roughly the expected rate of inflation through the end of 2020.
When thinking about the rate case, there are 4 key points to keep in mind. First, we are proposing a 4-year rate plan, which provides customers a higher degree of predictability with regard to the future cost of electricity. Second, for the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest a total of nearly $16 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2018 and beyond, to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter grid and a cleaner, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers for higher service reliability and lower bills, we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
Third, you may recall that FPL is required to file a comprehensive depreciation study as part of the rate case. The depreciation study to be filed with this rate case reflects the investments that FPL has made since the last study in 2009. Based on the changing mix of assets and the recoverable life spans, the resulting impact of the study is roughly a $200 million increase in annual depreciation expense.
Fourth, we expect to request a performance adder of 0.5% as part of FPL's allowed regulatory ROE. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern Coastal U.S., FPL has the cleanest carbon emissions rate, the most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability and the lowest customer bills, but an allowed ROE midpoint that is below the average of those peer utilities. We believe that the proposal for a performance adder presents an opportunity to reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage continued strong performance.
The estimated impact of the 3 base rate adjustments phased in during the 4-year period would total approximately $13 per month or $0.43 per day on the base portion of a typical residential bill. FPL has worked hard to deliver service that is ranked among the cleanest and most reliable for the lowest cost and has made the decision to seek relief only after a thorough review of its financial projections. Since 2001, FPL's investments in high-efficiency natural gas energy have saved customers more than $8 billion on fuel, while preventing 95 million tons of carbon emissions. In addition, while the cost of many materials and products that the company must purchase in order to provide affordable, reliable power have increased and the energy demand for Florida customers are growing with the projected addition of nearly 220,000 new service accounts during the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL's focus on efficiency and productivity has significantly lessened the bill impact.
Compared with the average utility's O&M cost, FPL's innovative practices and processes saved customers nearly $2 billion a year or approximately $17 per month for the average customer. Through its focus on cost reduction, FPL ranks best-in-class among major U.S. utilities for having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses, measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. 
In addition, while other utilities around the country are facing potentially higher costs to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan, FPL is already well positioned to comply with the targets in Florida. Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 20% lower than the state average and about 30% lower than the national average, and we expect it will continue to be among the lowest and lower than it was 10 years ago, in 2006, even with our requested base rate increases.
We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timeline for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter, with the final commission decision in the fourth quarter, in time for new rates to go into effect in January 2017.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement. Over a period of the last 17 years, FPL has entered into 5 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a degree of rate stability and certainty. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.
Turning now to expectations. For 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.
Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impacts on the business of the recent phase-down extension of bonus depreciation. Let me start by saying that we had already assumed the extension of bonus depreciation in our 2016 financial expectations. In addition, after analyzing the recent extension, we do not expect bonus depreciation to impact NextEra Energy's earnings per share expectations through 2018.
At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday, the board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing a 58% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. From this base, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit. The December 31, 2015, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million and CAFD of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at year-end December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
As we have said before, in the long run, in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose, we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. For 2016, beyond the ATM program, we continue to plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016, annual run rate. However, we will be smart, flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. If the equity markets are not accessible at reasonable prices, we expect to have sufficient debt capacity at NEP that, together with proceeds raised through our at-the-market dribble program, should be sufficient to finance currently planned 2016 transactions. Where conditions are appropriate, one alternative would be to raise equity privately, pre-funding drops before they are publicly announced. However, this is just one option that we are considering, and we may access the equity markets in other ways when market conditions permit. In addition, we expect our drops to be smaller in magnitude in order to manage the capital required to finance acquisitions.
As I mentioned earlier, the at-the-market dribble program has proven to be successful, as NEP raised approximately $26 million of equity during the fourth quarter, and we will continue to seek opportunities to use this program to help finance potential future acquisitions. We continue to believe it is important that we remain focused on the fundamentals and given the strength of NEP's sponsor and the prospects for future renewables development, the NEP value proposition, which relies on projects organically developed by Energy Resources rather than third-party acquisitions for growth, is the best in the space.
We plan to continue to be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide time for a recovery of the equity markets. NEP benefits from a strong sponsor, derisked and long-term contracted cash flows with an average contract life of 19 years, strong counterparty credits and projects that, in many cases, have been financed predominantly through mortgage-style financing that provide long-term protection against interest rate volatility. We remain optimistic that the NEP financing model can and will work going forward. 
In summary, we have excellent prospects for growth. The environment for new renewables development has never been stronger and FPL, Energy Resources and NEP each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2015 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute in 2016, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
With that, we will now open the lines for questions."

It's lumpy though, as you know. When we look at '17 through '20, we see a market that's proba",529,"So Steve, I think the first thing we look at is, if you go back over the last several years, you probably had a renewable market in the U.S. of 8 to 9 gigawatts. It's lumpy though, as you know. When we look at '17 through '20, we see a market that's probably much closer to 13 to 15 gigawatts, and there are some out there that would say that towards the latter part of the decade, that, that market could get up to 18 to 20 gigawatts. So when we look at it, we say, ""Well, gee whiz, we've gotten our fair share in the past and so our expectation is to continue to get our fair share in the future."" If you look at wind on its own, and by the way, it's often very difficult to separate how much of that is going to be wind and how much of it is going to be solar, although I will tell you that solar is more and more competitive the longer you go out. But if you look at the near term, if you look at '17 and '18, on the wind side, certainly, the expectations are that there's going to be an awful lot of wind built, right? Especially, if the IRS comes through with what we think they're going to come through, the same interpretation of in-construction as they've had before, you're going to likely get 100% PTCs for CODs on wind all the way through the end of 2018. 2017 remains to be seen, whether that will be a banner year for wind or not, but I think combined '17 and '18 will be pretty good on the wind side. Then you look at wind a little further out, obviously, you've got CPP. We and others have provided comments to EPA on CPP. One of those comments that EPA asked for was, what do we do with the Clean Energy Incentive Program, right? So right now, states have to have a state implementation plan that could go in as late as the fall of 2018. Before that plan goes in, you can't really get, under the incentive plan for renewables. So that's probably a '20 to '21 build that you see there. We're hoping that, that comes up a little bit. We do see CPP making a difference for wind, probably starting in '19, but certainly no later than '20. On the solar side, the way that it's been structured, you could potentially get 30% ITC on solar all the way through 2020. We continue -- I've said this over and over again in the past, we continue to be surprised by the demand for solar out there. It's certainly more competitive, but there's a lot of demand for solar. So we see fairly steady solar growth from '18 through '20. I think it was Dan that asked the question before about '16, maybe go to '17, which I don't -- I agree with what John said, but the point there also on solar is, you may actually see a smaller '17 because so much is getting built in '16. So is that good?"

There's always pressure on timing in that certainly FERC has been a little slower in terms of pipeline permitting that it's been historically, but we're feeling good about that. In terms of counterparty risk, obviously, we feel good with our portfolio projects that the vast, vast, vast majority of the counterparties that we have on all of our pipelines across both the Florida pipelines, Mountain Valley pipeline and the Texas pipelines, are all very strong credit-worthy entities. And so we don't have that counterparty risk that some of the other folks in the pipeline business do. And our average contract length is quite long, right? It's probably close to 20 years. So given where the market is at, obviously, there's a lot of distress in this market right now. We would have interest only in pipelines with strong credit counterparties and long-term contracts. And so if there are those that -- if there are those that become available, and there may be some of those that come available, given some of the things going on in the industry, we'll be interested in that.

Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 hi",5605,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71, which was $0.01 higher than the upper end of the range we discussed going into the year and up 8% from 2014. We also experienced double-digit growth in operating cash flow and continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. 
NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed the acceleration of its growth plan despite the challenges of difficult capital market conditions in the second half of the year, and grew its fourth quarter distribution per unit by 58%, versus the comparable prior year quarter, with a distribution of $0.3075 or $1.23 on an annualized basis. 
Before taking you through the detailed results, let me begin by summarizing some additional highlights. At Florida Power & Light, we continued to invest in the business in 2015 with a focus on delivering value to customers, and all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. Since the last call, we received Florida PSC approval of the 2019 need for our planned Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We expect this project to further advance our focus on providing clean, reliable and cost-effective energy for our customers, consistent with our long-term strategy. We continue to work hard at FPL to further enhance what we consider to be an already outstanding customer value proposition.
Our customers enjoy electric service that is cleaner and more reliable than ever before, while our typical residential customer bill is the lowest among reporting utilities in the state of Florida and is approximately 14% lower than it was a decade ago. Despite a challenging summer lightning season, FPL delivered its best-ever full year period of service reliability in 2015 and was recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. This was accomplished as we continue to invest and make the grid stronger, smarter and more responsive and resilient to outage conditions.
Our performance is the direct result of our focus on operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and the long-term investments we've made to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do, and 2015 was an excellent period of execution by the FPL team.
At Energy Resources, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for our contracted renewables development program. New renewables project additions drove financial results, while origination results for new projects to be placed into service by the end of 2016 exceeded the expectations that we discussed at our March investor conference. The longer-term outlook beyond 2016 also continued to develop favorably. The team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects over the last year, making this our second best year ever for renewables origination performance.
We continue to believe that Energy Resources is well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. We now have greater certainty regarding federal tax incentives for renewables, as Congress took action in December to extend the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase down period. We expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance with a 2-year safe harbor period for wind and solar somewhere informed what was put in place for the 2014 PTC.
The certainty regarding tax incentives will provide planning stability, which we think, in turn, will serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with combined cycle technology when tax incentives are phased down.
In the meantime, with tax incentives, both wind and solar will be very competitive. And in addition to the favorable impact of tax policy, we expect the carbon reduction requirements under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to significantly drive demand for new renewables as we move into the next decade. 
Finally, we expect low natural gas prices to continue to force coal to gas and coal to renewables switching, with new renewables supported by the factors I just mentioned.
Driven in large part by our enthusiasm about our renewables growth prospects, in the middle of last year, we increased our expectation for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base. These increased expectations will, in turn, affect our capital expenditure plans for our renewables development program, which we will update on the first quarter earnings call in April.
Across the portfolio, both Energy Resources and FPL continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil, nuclear and renewables generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with EFOR, or the equivalent forced outage rate, at less than 1.5% for the full year.
Similar to NextEra Energy, NEP also delivered on all of its financial expectations. NEP grew its portfolio through the acquisition of economic interests in over 1,000 megawatts of contracted renewables projects from Energy Resources, with total ownership increasing by over 1,200 megawatts and established its presence in the long-term contracted natural gas pipeline space with the acquisition of 7 natural gas pipelines in Texas. This acquisition is expected to reduce the impact resource variability has on the portfolio and extend NEP's runway of potential dropdown assets.
All of the same factors that favor growth in new renewables for Energy Resources likewise should benefit NEP. The strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners now and in the future. In contrast to many other yieldcos, NEP does not have the same dependence on third-party acquisitions to grow, but rather can reasonably expect to acquire projects that have been organically developed by its best-in-class sponsor.
We continue to believe that the strength of its sponsor and the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth is a core strength of the NEP value proposition, which is but one of many factors that distinguish it from other yieldcos. 
As we head into 2016, both NextEra Energy and NEP remain well positioned to deliver on their financial expectations, subject to the usual drivers of variability including, in particular, renewable resource variability. FPL benefits from a surplus amortization balance of $263 million, which is expected to position it to earn at the upper half of its ROE range, while it continues to execute on its capital investment initiatives for the benefit of customers.
In addition, the rate case will obviously be a core focus area for FPL in 2016. At Energy Resources, the business plan is built around the contribution from new investments and executing on the development and construction of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new renewables scheduled to go commercial by the end of the year. Meanwhile, NEP enters 2016 with a solid run rate and the flexibility necessary to execute its growth plans.
In summary, we are very optimistic about our prospects for another strong year.
Now let's look at our results for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $365 million or $0.79 per share, up $0.14 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2015, FPL reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.63 per share, up $0.18 per share versus 2014.
Regulatory capital employed grew 6.8% for 2015, which translated to net income growth of 8.6% for the full year, with fourth quarter performance leading the way. Regulatory capital employed continued to grow through the year. In addition to being the first full quarter since the closing of the Cedar Bay transaction in September, fourth quarter results were also impacted by timing effects and a number of smaller items, including outstanding performance under our asset optimization program.
As a reminder, FPL's current rate agreement provides an incentive mechanism for sharing with customers gains that we achieve in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities. In 2014, these activities produced roughly $67 million of incremental value. Of this amount, $54 million was for the benefit of Florida customers.
Under the sharing mechanism, which only applies once customer savings exceed $46 million, FPL was permitted to record approximately $13 million of pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Consistent with the expectations that we shared with you previously, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended December 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
During the fourth quarter, aided by the impact of unusually warm weather, we utilized only $67 million of reserve amortization. This brings our cumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 to $107 million, leaving us a balance of $263 million, which can be utilized in 2016.
In 2016, we expect to use the balance of the reserve amortization to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance, along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations, to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
Fourth quarter retail sales increased 11.7% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 9.6% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 2.1%, comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 0.7%.
As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to greater uncertainty in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons like we have seen throughout 2015.
For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6% compared to 2014. After adjusting for the effects of weather, full year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2%. Weather normalized underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3%. And looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. The economy in Florida continued to grow at a healthy rate, with strong jobs growth reflected in consistently low rates of seasonally-adjusted unemployment, around levels last seen in early 2008, and over 1 million jobs have been added from the low in December 2009, though the pace of jobs growth is beginning to slow. Leading indicators in the real estate sector continue to reflect a strong Florida housing market and the December reading of Florida's consumer sentiment remain close to post-recession highs.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with a reporting change. We have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our natural gas pipeline investments and the management of these projects within our gas infrastructure activities at Energy Resources.
As you may recall, our upstream gas infrastructure activities have not only better informed our hedging decisions, but have also led to opportunities and gas reserves to benefit Florida customers and the acquisition, development and construction of natural gas pipelines. Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the Corporate & Other segment. While our 2014 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development. Contributions from the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP in October are also included in the Energy Resources results for 2015.
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $156 million or $0.34 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $185 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat against the prior year comparable period, which primarily reflects contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate G&A and interest expenses.
For the full year 2015, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $926 million or $2.04 per share.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EPS increased $0.14 per share, despite a significant headwind associated with poor wind resource versus 2014, which was largely offset by strong results in our customer supply and trading business. These improved customer supply and trading results reflect, in part, a return to more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter following the adverse effects of polar vortex conditions in 2014. While wind resource was approximately 96% of the long-term average in 2015, other factors, including in particular, icing in the fourth quarter and other production losses, reduced production by another 2%.
New investments added $0.31 per share, consistent with the reporting change that I just mentioned. This includes $0.04 per share of contributions from our gas pipeline projects, reflecting the addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP to the portfolio as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. New renewables investments added $0.27 per share, reflecting continued strong growth in our portfolio of contracted wind and solar projects. In 2015 alone, we commissioned approximately 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects and approximately 285 megawatts of new solar projects.
Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, which declined by $0.02 per share, were negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense as a result of higher depletion rates. Based on market conditions, we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in an earlier recognition of income through the value of the hedges we had in place. Although this helped mitigate other negative effects in 2015, including higher depletion rates, below commodity price environment presents a challenge for these activities going forward.
Partially offsetting the growth in the business was a negative impact of $0.22 per share, reflecting higher interest and corporate expenses, including increased development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewables business. Results also were impacted by negative $0.06 per share of share dilution while benefiting from the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NEP. Additional details for our results are shown on the accompanying slide.
Energy Resources' full year adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 9%. Cash flow from operations excluding the impact of working capital increased approximately 14%. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources' adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2014.
As I mentioned earlier, 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for new wind and solar originations. Since our last earnings call, we have signed contracts for an additional 206 megawatts of wind projects for 2016 delivery. With these additions, we have exceeded the expectations we shared at our March 2015 investor conference for our 2015, 2016 development program. The accompanying chart updates information on where each of our programs now stand. We've also signed contracts in California and Ontario for storage projects to enter service in the next couple of years. Although it is early in the technology life cycle, we are successfully originating storage projects to support our expectations to invest up to $100 million per year in order to maintain our competitive position with regard to this important emerging technology.
For all the reasons I mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that the fundamental outlook for our renewables business has never been stronger, and we are working on an update to our capital expenditure expectations for our 2017 to 2018 development program. It is important to keep in mind that because these projects drive growth upon entering commercial operation, the greatest potential benefits are to 2019 and beyond. For 2016, we believe that our development program is largely complete other than 1 or 2 additional opportunities that we are pursuing.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects that are now reported in the Energy Resources segment. The Florida pipelines remain on track, and we expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval early this year to support construction beginning in mid-2016 and an expected in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be approximately $1 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process and filed its formal application in October 2015. We continue to see market interest in the pipeline, and we're pleased to announce earlier this month the addition of Consolidated Edison as a shipper on the line as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream as a partner. We continue to expect approximately 2 BCF per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. With the addition of Con Edison, our ownership share in this project now stands at approximately 31% and our expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $135 million, and cash available for distribution was $75 million. During the quarter, the assets in the NEP portfolio operated well. Overall renewable resource was generally in line with our long-term expectations, and the acquisitions of the Texas pipelines and Jericho Wind Farm were completed as planned. Overall, 2015 was a successful year of execution against our growth objectives. Consistent with our decision to accelerate the growth of NEP, the portfolio grew throughout the year to support a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 58% against the 2014 comparable fourth quarter distribution.
Also consistent with the range of expectations that we have shared, full year adjusted EBITDA was approximately $404 million, and cash available for distribution was $126 million.
Clearly, 2015 had its challenges as well. Changes in market conditions not only affected our financing plan in 2015, but also led us to pursue additional options to be more flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets going forward.
On the last call, we announced an at-the-market equity issuance or dribble program for up to $150 million at NEP. At the same time, NextEra Energy also announced a program to purchase, from time to time based on market conditions and other considerations, up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. During the quarter, NEP completed the sale of over 887,000 common units, raising approximately $26 million under the ATM program.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $507 million or $1.10 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $530 million and $1.17 per share, respectively. For the full year 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.8 billion or $6.06 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.6 billion or $5.71 per share.
Our earnings per share results for the year account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June and September settlements, totaling approximately 16 million shares, associated with the equity units issued in 2012.
The impact of dilution on full year results was approximately $0.17 per share. The issuance of additional shares is consistent both with our strategy of maintaining a strong financial position and with our ability to grow adjusted EPS at 6% to 8% per year over a multiyear period.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.09 per share compared to 2014, primarily due to investment gains and the absence of debt retirement losses incurred in 2014.
NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition grew by 16% in 2015. And as expected, we maintain our strong credit position, which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital-intensive industry.
At FPL, we will continue to focus on excellent execution and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In addition, the rate case proceeding will be a core area of focus that is likely to occupy much of 2016, and I will discuss this more in just a moment. 
With regard to delivering on our customer value proposition and executing on our major capital initiatives at FPL, we will focus on completing our generation modernization project at Port Everglades, constructing our peaker upgrades at Lauderdale and Fort Myers and delivering the 3 new large-scale solar projects and our other additional investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure.
At Energy Resources, growth will continue to come primarily through the addition of new renewables and continued construction of our gas pipeline projects, which we expect to more than offset PTC roll-off of approximately $37 million. We feel better than ever about the quality of our renewables development pipeline. And as we said in the last call, over the next few years, we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to our wind and solar origination and development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of the growing North American renewables market.
Headwinds could come from the potential impact of El Niño on wind resource in the first half of the year and current weak commodity price environment. With regard to weak commodity prices, we evaluated our generation portfolio for markets where we expect low prices for sustained periods of time. As a result of that exercise, we took steps at the end of last year to reduce approximately 40% of our merchant generation capacity by entering into a contract to sell our Lamar and Forney natural gas fire-generating assets located in ERCOT. Once closed, the sale is expected to be slightly accretive to our EPS and credit profile and will generate $450 million in net cash proceeds that will be recycled into our long-term contract and renewables business.
We remain well hedged through 2018, and we'll continue to evaluate our other merchant-generating assets for potential capital recycling opportunities.
With regard to our upstream gas infrastructure business, sustained weak commodity prices, of course, means fewer new drilling opportunities, other things equal, and we have reduced our expectations of future growth from this part of the portfolio. When we elect to drill, we hedge most of our expected gas and oil production for up to 7 years. In cases where we have elected not to drill, we have, as we did in the fourth quarter, liquidated the hedges that were put in place, which generally allows us to recover a portion of our original investment on those wells that we had planned to drill.
At the corporate level, we don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity. And if there would be a need, we would expect it to be modest. Similar to previous years, we will work to maintain a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities. Also, as I just mentioned, we plan to evaluate capital recycling opportunities within our merchant generation portfolio as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated.
Earlier this month, we filed a test year letter with the Florida PSC to initiate a new rate proceeding for rates beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. FPL is finalizing a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2017 through 2020. While the details of the numbers are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $860 million starting in January 2017, $265 million starting in January 2018, and $200 million upon commission of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020. Based on these adjustments, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's current typical bill for January 2016 will grow at about 2.8%, roughly the expected rate of inflation through the end of 2020.
When thinking about the rate case, there are 4 key points to keep in mind. First, we are proposing a 4-year rate plan, which provides customers a higher degree of predictability with regard to the future cost of electricity. Second, for the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest a total of nearly $16 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2018 and beyond, to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter grid and a cleaner, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers for higher service reliability and lower bills, we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
Third, you may recall that FPL is required to file a comprehensive depreciation study as part of the rate case. The depreciation study to be filed with this rate case reflects the investments that FPL has made since the last study in 2009. Based on the changing mix of assets and the recoverable life spans, the resulting impact of the study is roughly a $200 million increase in annual depreciation expense.
Fourth, we expect to request a performance adder of 0.5% as part of FPL's allowed regulatory ROE. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern Coastal U.S., FPL has the cleanest carbon emissions rate, the most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability and the lowest customer bills, but an allowed ROE midpoint that is below the average of those peer utilities. We believe that the proposal for a performance adder presents an opportunity to reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage continued strong performance.
The estimated impact of the 3 base rate adjustments phased in during the 4-year period would total approximately $13 per month or $0.43 per day on the base portion of a typical residential bill. FPL has worked hard to deliver service that is ranked among the cleanest and most reliable for the lowest cost and has made the decision to seek relief only after a thorough review of its financial projections. Since 2001, FPL's investments in high-efficiency natural gas energy have saved customers more than $8 billion on fuel, while preventing 95 million tons of carbon emissions. In addition, while the cost of many materials and products that the company must purchase in order to provide affordable, reliable power have increased and the energy demand for Florida customers are growing with the projected addition of nearly 220,000 new service accounts during the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL's focus on efficiency and productivity has significantly lessened the bill impact.
Compared with the average utility's O&M cost, FPL's innovative practices and processes saved customers nearly $2 billion a year or approximately $17 per month for the average customer. Through its focus on cost reduction, FPL ranks best-in-class among major U.S. utilities for having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses, measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. 
In addition, while other utilities around the country are facing potentially higher costs to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan, FPL is already well positioned to comply with the targets in Florida. Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 20% lower than the state average and about 30% lower than the national average, and we expect it will continue to be among the lowest and lower than it was 10 years ago, in 2006, even with our requested base rate increases.
We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timeline for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter, with the final commission decision in the fourth quarter, in time for new rates to go into effect in January 2017.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement. Over a period of the last 17 years, FPL has entered into 5 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a degree of rate stability and certainty. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.
Turning now to expectations. For 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.
Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impacts on the business of the recent phase-down extension of bonus depreciation. Let me start by saying that we had already assumed the extension of bonus depreciation in our 2016 financial expectations. In addition, after analyzing the recent extension, we do not expect bonus depreciation to impact NextEra Energy's earnings per share expectations through 2018.
At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday, the board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing a 58% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. From this base, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit. The December 31, 2015, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million and CAFD of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at year-end December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
As we have said before, in the long run, in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose, we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. For 2016, beyond the ATM program, we continue to plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016, annual run rate. However, we will be smart, flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. If the equity markets are not accessible at reasonable prices, we expect to have sufficient debt capacity at NEP that, together with proceeds raised through our at-the-market dribble program, should be sufficient to finance currently planned 2016 transactions. Where conditions are appropriate, one alternative would be to raise equity privately, pre-funding drops before they are publicly announced. However, this is just one option that we are considering, and we may access the equity markets in other ways when market conditions permit. In addition, we expect our drops to be smaller in magnitude in order to manage the capital required to finance acquisitions.
As I mentioned earlier, the at-the-market dribble program has proven to be successful, as NEP raised approximately $26 million of equity during the fourth quarter, and we will continue to seek opportunities to use this program to help finance potential future acquisitions. We continue to believe it is important that we remain focused on the fundamentals and given the strength of NEP's sponsor and the prospects for future renewables development, the NEP value proposition, which relies on projects organically developed by Energy Resources rather than third-party acquisitions for growth, is the best in the space.
We plan to continue to be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide time for a recovery of the equity markets. NEP benefits from a strong sponsor, derisked and long-term contracted cash flows with an average contract life of 19 years, strong counterparty credits and projects that, in many cases, have been financed predominantly through mortgage-style financing that provide long-term protection against interest rate volatility. We remain optimistic that the NEP financing model can and will work going forward. 
In summary, we have excellent prospects for growth. The environment for new renewables development has never been stronger and FPL, Energy Resources and NEP each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2015 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute in 2016, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
With that, we will now open the lines for questions."

The -- how much equity content we need in any given year is always driven by how much capital we're going to deploy, what the opportunities are, how we're doing against all of our financing activities and we have a whole host of things that we -- a whole host of levers at our disposal that we go to. And obviously, issuing equity is very -- and the team knows this, is very low on my list of the kind of things that we want to do to finance the plan. Now obviously, the flip side of that is we need a strong balance sheet and we're committed to strong ratios to maintain a strong balance sheet. So what we said is, I think very clear in the script. We said we don't believe we're going to have an equity need this year, and if there is one, it's going to be very modest."

It's lumpy though, as you know.

It's lumpy though, as you know. When we look at '17 through '20, we see a market that's probably much closer to 13 to 15 gigawatts, and there are some out there that would say that towards the latter part of the decade, that, that market could get up to 18 to 20 gigawatts. So when we look at it, we say, ""Well, gee whiz, we've gotten our fair share in the past and so our expectation is to continue to get our fair share in the future."" If you look at wind on its own, and by the way, it's often very difficult to separate how much of that is going to be wind and how much of it is going to be solar, although I will tell you that solar is more and more competitive the longer you go out. But if you look at the near term, if you look at '17 and '18, on the wind side, certainly, the expectations are that there's going to be an awful lot of wind built, right? Especially, if the IRS comes through with what we think they're going to come through, the same interpretation of in-construction as they've had before, you're going to likely get 100% PTCs for CODs on wind all the way through the end of 2018. 2017 remains to be seen, whether that will be a banner year for wind or not, but I think combined '17 and '18 will be pretty good on the wind side. Then you look at wind a little further out, obviously, you've got CPP. We and others have provided comments to EPA on CPP. One of those comments that EPA asked for was, what do we do with the Clean Energy Incentive Program, right? So right now, states have to have a state implementation plan that could go in as late as the fall of 2018. Before that plan goes in, you can't really get, under the incentive plan for renewables. So that's probably a '20 to '21 build that you see there. We're hoping that, that comes up a little bit. We do see CPP making a difference for wind, probably starting in '19, but certainly no later than '20. On the solar side, the way that it's been structured, you could potentially get 30% ITC on solar all the way through 2020. We continue -- I've said this over and over again in the past, we continue to be surprised by the demand for solar out there. It's certainly more competitive, but there's a lot of demand for solar. So we see fairly steady solar growth from '18 through '20. I think it was Dan that asked the question before about '16, maybe go to '17, which I don't -- I agree with what John said, but the point there also on solar is, you may actually see a smaller '17 because so much is getting built in '16. So is that good?"

There's always pressure on timing in that certainly FERC has been a little slower in terms of pipeline permitting that it's been historically, but we're feeling good about that. In terms of counterparty risk, obviously, we feel good with our portfolio projects that the vast, vast, vast majority of the counterparties that we have on all of our pipelines across both the Florida pipelines, Mountain Valley pipeline and the Texas pipelines, are all very strong credit-worthy entities. And so we don't have that counterparty risk that some of the other folks in the pipeline business do. And our average contract length is quite long, right? It's probably close to 20 years. So given where the market is at, obviously, there's a lot of distress in this market right now. We would have interest only in pipelines with strong credit counterparties and long-term contracts. And so if there are those that -- if there are those that become available, and there may be some of those that come available, given some of the things going on in the industry, we'll be interested in that.

NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and have made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter ad",4372,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and have made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10% and the company continued to deliver significant growth in cash flow from operations against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance of both Florida Power & Energy resources.
NextEra Energy Partners group distributions by 55% versus the prior year comparable period and continued to add to the solid run rate with which it entered the year by successfully acquiring 2 new win projects.
At Florida Power & Light, growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business to further advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. Our major capital initiatives remain on track and I'm pleased to report that the new Port Everglades next generation clean energy center entered service on April 1, on budget and 2 months ahead of schedule. In addition, construction began on FPL 3 74.5-megawatt utility scale solar PV projects. As a reminder, this project leverage existing infrastructure in prior development work the cost effectively add more solar to our system and upon expected delivery by the end of the year or roughly triple FPL's solar capacity.
Not only will these projects help to further diversify FPL's fuel mix, but they also demonstrate FPL's commitment to providing customers low-cost and reliable clean energy solutions. Due impart to our efforts to modernize our existing generation at the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to deliver FPL's fourth rate decrease in the past 16 months. On March 15, we filed our formal request for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement.
Our 2017, the 2020 base rate proposal is largely consistent with what we indicated in the test year letter. Under this proposal, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL estimates it's typical residential bill in 2020, will still be lower than what it was in 2006, and will remain among the lowest in the state and nation based on current bill comparisons.
At Energy Resources, contributions from continued growth and our contracted renewables portfolio and investments in natural gas pipelines drove strong financial results for the quarter. Since the last call, the team signed additional PPAs for additional for approximately 250 megawatts of U.S. win proposed 2016 delivery and closed on an acquisition of a 100-megawatt 1 facility located in New Mexico that begin operations in 2009.
We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the North American renewables business have never been stronger. And I will provide an update on our latest expectations for a long-term contract and renewables development program later in the call.
In addition, earlier this month, we increased our participation in the Sabal trail natural gas pipeline project through the incremental purchase of a 9.5% equity interest from spectra energy, bringing our total ownership share from 33% to 42.5%. At NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to believe that a strong sponsor with a highly visible runway for future growth is a core driver of the NEP value proposition. During the quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of the ceiling 1 and 2 win projects from Energy Resources, totaling approximately 300 megawatts.
Despite challenging capital market conditions, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition was purchased by the underwriter at the time of announcement. The overall allotment option was also subsequently exercised in full. In addition, NEP success in accessing the equity markets to continue to grow it's renewables robust generation portfolio. First quarter operating performance was excellent and cash available for distribution was slightly better than our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of 31.875 cents per common unit or $1.275 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 55% over the prior year.
At this early point in the year, we are really pleased with our progress of both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the first quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $393 million, or $0.85 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.05 or approximately 6% year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employee grew roughly 8.6% over the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.2 billion of the approximately $4.1 million to $4.3 billion of capital expenditures that we expect for the full year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate of agreement, we recorded reserved amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12 month period. We entered 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million, and we utilized $176 million during the first quarter in order to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5% that I just mentioned.
This was slightly better than our expectations, leaving us with a balance of $87 million, which can be utilized in the reminder of 2016.
Since the start of our current rate agreement in 2013, we have utilized a larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year due to the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different.
We continue to expect to utilize the balance of the reserve amortization this year to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M mix expectations to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
The Florida economy remains solid. The focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continue to encourage business expansion and additional hiring. Florida is a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped to an 8-year low of 4.9% in March, down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and below the national rate of 5.0%. Over the same time period, the number of jobs increased 2.9% and over $1 million jobs have now been added in the state since December 2010.
As an indicator of new construction, newbuilding permits have showed strong growth in the most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 6.0% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow in the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post-recession highs.
During the first quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 64,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter, which had a favorable impact on sales of 1.3%. However, customer growth was more than offset by a 1.4% decline in sales due to mild weather during the quarter. Also, compared to the same quarter last year, underlying usage per customer declined 0.4% on a weather normalized basis. Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year.
After accounting for these effects and the impact of leap-year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% year-over-year. The number of inactive accounts reaches lowest level to more than a decade and stronger growth and new service accounts during the quarter reflected healthy levels of construction.
As I mentioned earlier, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detail supported information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceedings. The overall proposed for our 2017 for 2020 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $866 million starting January 2017, $262 million starting January 2018 and $209 million upon completion of Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019 with no base rate adjustment in 2020.
We are proud to offer customer service that ranks among the cleanest and most reliable in the country with typical residential bills among the lowest in the nation and 15% lower than 2006.
The four-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments of long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves our liability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections with fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at about 2.8% per year from January 2016 through the end of 2020, which is about the same as the expected rate of inflation.
The Florida Public Service Commission has established a definitive schedule for this proceeding beginning with quality of service hearings in June, rebutting testimony from interveners and staff in July, rebutting testimony from FPL in August and technical hearings in late August and early September. The proceedings will conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. The nearly 9,000 employees of FPL that were for many years following the consistent strategy that has led to FPL current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. The 2013 settlement agreement has been benefited customers by eliminating the need for general base rate increase for 4 years, while at the same time, providing stability and certainty around the level of customer bills.
We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $224 million or $0.48 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $306 million or $0.66 per share, while adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year. As a reminder, our reporting for Energy Resources now include a results for natural gas pipeline projects, formally reported in the Corporate & Other segment. While our first quarter 2015 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects for minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development.
Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.08 from the prior-year comparable quarter. New investments added $0.14 per share including $0.10 from continued growth and our contract renewables portfolio. These results reflect approximately 1,840 megawatts of new renewables projects placed into service during or after the first quarter of 2015. New investments and natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share, reflecting the net addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. Wind resources was 98% of a long-term average versus 87% in the first quarter of 2015, and this favorable comparison was the principal driver of increased contributions from existing assets of $0.04 per share. Partially offsetting these results were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, increased corporate expenses primarily related to the growth in the business, and the impact of share dilution.
Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well, positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. Over the last decade, we have invested roughly $23 billion and wind and solar generation. Last year alone, the team signed contracts for total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables project, making 2015 our second best year for renewables origination performance. With these additions, along with the 100-megawatt acquisitions since the last call that I mentioned earlier, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program is over 4,000 megawatts. This result is roughly 500 megawatts above the midpoint of the range for these years that we discussed at our investor conference last March, making 2015 and 2016 the most successful two-year period for renewables development in our history.
Energy Resources continued to benefit from growing demand for renewables and has built, what we believe, is the largest and highest quality renewables development pipeline in the space. Driving that growth is a number of favorable trends. First, Congress at the end of last year provided increase certainty of U.S. federal tax incentives for renewables through the extension of the 2014 wind PTC in the 2016 solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase down period. This former policy support has been very important over the last decade and with the extensions, we believe that renewables are well positioned to support a higher base opportunity set, would otherwise have been the case not only through 2018, but into the next decade.
Together with the extension, we expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance for both wind and solar. For wind, the guidance is expected to be consistent with and perhaps more constructive to what has previously been in place, which will support an the ability to continue to offer very attractive pricing to our customers into the next decade. The start of construction guidance for wind is likely to be released by the IRS over the next few months, while solar guidance is expected to follow later on, given that the COD deadline for the first step of the phase down of the solar ITC is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
In turn, we expect the added planning stability provided by tax incentives to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines, and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a cost of energy basis with gas fire technology when tax incentives are phased down.
We have seen significant wind turbine efficiency improvements over the last several years and more are expected over the next few years. Likewise, solar panel cost have fallen steadily, while efficiency has also improved substantially with even more advances expected over the next few years.
Solar balance system costs are also expected to experience significant reductions during the same period. Both wind and solar are well positioned to compete head-to-head with gas-fire generation technologies, now and as we head into the next decade. Lower natural gas prices and the environmental regulation are expected to continue to pressure existing coal facilities and renewables are well situation as a shift away for coal continues. Not only do wind and solar continue to benefit from cost and efficiency improvements, and the economic support of tax incentives, the renewables also help customers meet both state and potential federal environmental compliance obligations.
In addition, state-level renewable portfolio standards are now in place in 29 states and discussions have increased in the renewable requirements under these standards, are continuing certain of these states.
Despite the stay of the Clean Power Plan by The United States Supreme Court, we continue to believe that the regulatory trend in North America will continue to be towards supporting more renewable energy. We expect resource planning activities for increasingly stringent environmental rules and potential carbon emissions regulations, whether at the state or federal level, will help further support demand.
For these reasons, we expect some of our potential customers to be motivated, not only by the economics in new renewables, but also by the consideration of current or potential future environmental compliance obligations such as the Clean Power Plan.
Due to the combination of these trends favoring the development of new renewables, the U.S. wind and solar market is expected to grow significantly into the next decade. We will continue to leverage our core strength in solar and wind and invest in related areas such as energy storage in order to offer our customers innovative, low-cost and high quality projects that we expect to further enhance our competitive position.
We believe that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale and operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage place us in an excellent strategy position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
In addition, we expect our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new nontraditional customers, particularly in the form of commercial and industrial demand, as improving renewable economic are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to power from clean generation resources.
Based on everything we see now, we expect to bring into service roughly 2,400 to 3,800 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame. The low end of that ranges matches, what we expect to bring in the services from 2015 to 2016, one of our most successful origination periods to date, and is roughly 3 times of we indicated in our March 2015 investor conference.
On the U.S. solar said, the ITC extension may cause some customers to the sign contracts since the 30% ITC is in place for 2019. As such, we believe that a range of 400 to 1,300 megawatts is reasonable for the 2017 to 2018 time frame.
Impart, this range reflects an expectation to continue to build upon our recent successes as we've been positively surprised by the amount of demand we've seen for 2016 bill.
As a reminder, our 2015 to 2016 solar development program consists of over 1,300 megawatts, reflecting outstanding origination results for Greenfield and early stage development projects. However, we believe that some of this recent success may reflect the pulling forward of demand for future years. Overall, we expect a greater portion of new demand, particularly for solar to projects delivered in 2018 and beyond.
Over the last 8 years, we have successfully developed and acquired more than 880 megawatts of new renewables project in Canada. We continue to pursue development of new Canadian solar wind in storage products and potential for up to 300 megawatts of new Canadian wind development opportunities over the 2017 to 2018 period.
We are also contemplating repowering certain of of our wind generating facilities, which required new investments to be made to upgrade current equipment to the latest technology. On a project level basis, the incremental earnings and cash flow generation potential from these repowering investments could be similar to a new build opportunities, given that we would be targeting projects that are not generating PTCs. However, this effort is still on its early stages and is contingent on IRS guidance that is expected to be released in the second quarter. We expect to be able to give a further update on where we are regarding this opportunity before the end of the year.
Energy Resources expectations for capital expenditures to support the 2017 and 2018 renewables development program are $7 million to $29 billion, reflecting a midpoint of 4,100 megawatts of new projects over this time frame. These capital expenditure expectations are roughly the same as for our record-breaking 2015 and 2016 program.
While there is some uncertainty as to the timing of these new build opportunities, we expect a greater portion of new project demand, and in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although, we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations, while only a quarter of the way through 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties, including most importantly, the tender of IRS construction guidance and it's related impact on the timing of customer demand.
Similar to previous years, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities that supports our overall corporate credit position. We currently don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity to support our renewables bill. As we discussed on last call, our enthusiasm about our renewable growth prospects was a major driver of the increased expectations for next NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% for 2018 off of 2014 base that we announced in the middle of last year.
We continue to expect our renewables development program to support those expectations in our longer-term growth prospects. It is important to keep in mind that the greatest potential contribution of earnings and cash flow growth from these 2017 and 2018 development projects are for 2019 and beyond.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, and cash available for distribution was $38 million, up $71 million and $53 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to portfolio growth. Before accounting for debt service, cash available for distribution was $112 million. New projects added $70 million of adjusted EBITDA and $55 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, the existing assets in the NEP portfolio operated well and benefited from a year-over-year in wind resources. For the NEP portfolio, wind resources were roughly 100% of the long-term average versus 86% in the first quarter of 2015. Total resources was also strong during the quarter, but the year-over-year impact was small. Adjusted EBITDA from existing projects increased by $5 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. The comparable increase in cash available for distribution was slightly greater due to favorable debt refinancing activities and the timing of tax equity contributions. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $6 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. The impact of other effect including higher management fees and outside services are shown on the accompany slide.
Turning now to the consulted results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $636 million or $1.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $715 million and $1.55 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segments increased 1% per share compared to the first quarter of 2015.
The sale of our Lamar and Florida natural gas generation assets located in closed just after the end of the first quarter. This transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million, and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $107 million that will be excluded from NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings. We expect continued opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. In addition, the strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of low risk, long-term contracted assets, potentially available for sales NextEra Energy Partners.
Our continued focus on recycling capital at Energy Resources, whether through third party asset sales or drop downs to NEP, together with what we believe, is an outstanding regulated opportunity set at FPL, continue to support our ability to balanced growth across our 2 main businesses.
Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Looking further ahead, we also continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate of 2014 base of 6% to 8%.
As always, our expectations are subject to the usual, including but not limited in normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP. The acquisition of the ceiling 1 and 2 projects during the first quarter has added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate and has further increased NEP's flexibility for the balance of the year. We expect the current portfolio post the acquisition of ceiling 1 and 2 to support our run rate of $210 million to $240 million, which is within the range of our December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate expectations of $210 million to $290 million.
Due to our ability to raise approximately $287 million in equity to acquire these projects, their contribution the cash available for distribution and the success we've had under the ATM program, we now have more liquidity and debt capacity that we had coming into the year. We continue to evaluate the optimal long-term capital structure for NEP and our current thinking is that the portfolio can support coverage ratio of approximately 3.5x project distributions after debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. As a result, we have flexibility as to who we finance our next acquisition and can be opportunistic regarding our approach to further growth opportunities for the balance of the year. We have included a new slide in the appendix for today's presentation with additional details regarding NEP's current incremental debt capacity.
The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and our net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as been a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is displayable in February 2017. In summary, we continue to believe that in NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. We remain very focused on the execution of objectives for the year and we are off to a good start.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open the line for questions."

We've talked about repowers in the past with investors. We have repowered some of our sites in the past. We've torn turbines down and put up new turbines. But what you're actually looking at is the possibility of enhancing some of our older sites and still being able to qualify for new production tax credits. So it's difficult to at this point to say how big the opportunity is. And it's actually difficult to say exactly what the IRS guidance would have to look like for us to feel comfortable. The IRS has current guidance, on what I'll call, if you have an old piece of equipment and you refurbish that equipment to some extent, there are some cases where that new refurbished equipment could get all of the tax benefits of a new piece of equipment. And so that guidance is already out there. How and when it might imply to what we're talking about is something that we're interested in. So at this point, it's an opportunity.

And when we did close it, we announced that one of the things we said is, we're very excited about all of the opportunities, not only we thought were identified opportunities, but all of the unidentified opportunities, because there was a vast pipeline system inside of Texas. Since then, we've seen continued activity from the Mexican front and we're not in Mexico, just to clear that point up. But from the Mexican front, they continued to import a lot of gas and have a lot of needs. That's creating opportunities. Opportunities that we hope will actually turn into something for NEP. Because in particular our pipes are --  NEP pipes are well placed in Texas to be able to provide to Mexico. In terms of the expansion projects, there were a couple of projects. There were some smaller projects that we expected to get completed during the first 12 or 18 months. I don't know that many of those projects have fallen off the radar as a matter of fact, there has been more project that have been added on what I call the small-scale optimization, which is good, which is good for NEP. And then there were a couple of larger expansion projects that we' had until, under the terms of the agreement, until the end of this year to figure out whether they were going to come in or not, and those appear okay at this point. One of them actually appears quite favorable. I think, we're not going to know the pace of actually signing something up with particularly with the Mexican government, isn't as quick as we would like to see. So we would like for, we'll probably see more activity, and we'll have more to say towards the end of the year. There is a $200 million incentive payment to the owners -- previous owners of should those expansion projects come online. And obviously, if they don't, that saves NET $200 million. So I think, the previous owners and us are all well incented to get the expansion projects done. But it's a just a little too early to figure out how we're going to do by the end of the year."

And so, I wouldn't really expect at least in the near term, for us to redoing any significant acquisitions at NEP. But the only thing I would add is that we have such a massive pipeline of projects at near that can be drop down into NEP. There's not a huge need for us to be looking at third-party acquisitions. And frankly, our focus remains at near on great renewable development work and on creating an even more massive pipeline of things that we can drop down into NEP this year and go forward."

NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and have made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter ad",4382,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and have made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10% and the company continued to deliver significant growth in cash flow from operations against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.
NextEra Energy Partners grew per-unit distributions by 55% versus the prior year comparable period and continued to add to the solid run rate with which it entered the year by successfully acquiring 2 new wind projects.
At Florida Power & Light, growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business to further advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. Our major capital initiatives remain on track, and I am pleased to report that the new Port Everglades Next Generation Clean Energy Center entered service on April 1, on budget and 2 months ahead of schedule. In addition, construction began on FPL's 3 74.5-megawatt utility-scale solar PV projects. As a reminder, these projects leverage existing infrastructure in prior development work that cost effectively add more solar to our system, and upon expected delivery by the end of the year will roughly triple FPL's solar capacity.
Not only will these projects help to further diversify FPL's fuel mix, but they also demonstrate FPL's commitment to providing customers low-cost and reliable clean energy solutions. Due in part to our efforts to modernize our existing generation, at the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to deliver FPL's fourth rate decrease in the past 16 months. On March 15, we filed our formal request for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement.
Our 2017-2020 base rate proposal is largely consistent with what we indicated in the test year letter. Under this proposal, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL estimates its typical residential bill in 2020 will still be lower than what it was in 2006, and will remain among the lowest in the state and nation based on current bill comparisons.
At Energy Resources, contributions from continued growth and our contracted renewables portfolio and investments in natural gas pipelines drove strong financial results for the quarter. Since the last call, the team signed additional PPAs for additional for approximately 250 megawatts of U.S. wind proposed 2016 delivery and closed on an acquisition of a 100-megawatt wind facility located in New Mexico that began operations in 2009.
We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the North American renewables business have never been stronger. And I will provide an update on our latest expectations for our long-term contracted renewables development program later in the call.
In addition, earlier this month, we increased our participation in the Sabal Trail natural gas pipeline project through the incremental purchase of a 9.5% equity interest from Spectra Energy, bringing our total ownership share from 33% to 42.5%. At NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to believe that a strong sponsor with a highly visible runway for future growth is a core driver of the NEP value proposition. During the quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of the Seiling I & II wind projects from Energy Resources, totaling approximately 300 megawatts.
Despite challenging capital market conditions, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition was purchased by the underwriter at the time of announcement. The over-allotment option was also subsequently exercised in full. 
In addition to NEP's success in accessing the equity markets to continue to grow its renewables robust generation portfolio, first quarter operating performance was excellent and cash available for distribution was slightly better than our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.31875 per common unit or $1.275 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 55% over the prior year.
At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress of both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the first quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $393 million, or $0.85 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.05 or approximately 6% year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.6% over the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.2 billion of the approximately $4.1 million to $4.3 billion of capital expenditures that we expect for the full year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We entered 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million, and we utilized $176 million during the first quarter in order to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5% that I just mentioned.
This was slightly better than our expectations, leaving us with a balance of $87 million, which can be utilized in the reminder of 2016.
Since the start of our current rate agreement in 2013, we have utilized a larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year due to the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different.
We continue to expect to utilize the balance of the reserve amortization this year to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance, along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M mix expectations, to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
The Florida economy remains solid. A focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continue to encourage business expansion and additional hiring. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped to an 8-year low of 4.9% in March, down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and below the national rate of 5.0%. Over the same time period, the number of jobs increased 2.9% and over $1 million jobs have now been added in the state since December 2010.
As an indicator of new construction, new building permits have shown strong growth in the most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 6.0% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow, and the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post-recession highs.
During the first quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 64,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, which had a favorable impact on sales of 1.3%. However, customer growth was more than offset by a 1.4% decline in sales due to mild weather during the quarter. Also, compared to the same quarter last year, underlying usage per customer declined 0.4% on a weather-normalized basis. Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year.
After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% year-over-year. The number of inactive accounts reaches lowest level in more than a decade and stronger growth and new service accounts during the quarter reflected healthy levels of construction.
As I mentioned earlier, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2017-2020 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $866 million starting January 2017, $262 million starting January 2018 and $209 million upon commissioning of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020.
We are proud to offer customers service that ranks among the cleanest and most reliable in the country, with typical residential bills among the lowest in the nation and 15% lower than 2006.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves our reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at about 2.8% per year from January 2016 through the end of 2020, which is about the same as the expected rate of inflation.
The Florida Public Service Commission has established a definitive schedule for this proceeding, beginning with quality of service hearings in June, rebuttal testimony from interveners and staff in July, rebutting testimony from FPL on August; and technical hearings in late August and early September. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. 
The nearly 9,000 employees of FPL have worked hard and thoughtfully for many years following the consistent strategy that has led to FPL's current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. The 2013 settlement agreement has benefited customers by eliminating the need for general base rate increase for 4 years, while at the same time, providing stability and certainty around the level of customer bills.
We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer, and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $224 million or $0.48 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $306 million or $0.66 per share, while adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year. As a reminder, our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formally reported in the Corporate & Others segment. While our first quarter 2015 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development.
Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. New investments added $0.14 per share, including $0.10 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. These results reflect approximately 1,840 megawatts of new renewables projects placed into service during or after the first quarter of 2015. New investments in natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share, reflecting the net addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. Wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 87% in the first quarter of 2015, and this favorable comparison was the principal driver of increased contributions from existing assets of $0.04 per share. Partially offsetting these results were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, increased corporate expenses primarily related to growth in the business, and the impact of share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. Over the last decade, we have invested roughly $23 billion in wind and solar generation. Last year alone, the team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables project, making 2015 our second best year ever for renewables origination performance. With these additions, along with the 100-megawatt acquisition since the last call that I mentioned earlier, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program is over 4,000 megawatts. This result is roughly 500 megawatts above the midpoint of the range for these years that we discussed at our investor conference last March, making 2015 and 2016 the most successful 2-year period for renewables development in our history.
Energy Resources continues to benefit from growing demand for renewables and has built what we believe is the largest and highest quality renewables development pipeline in the space. Driving that growth is a number of favorable trends. First, Congress, at the end of last year, provided increased certainty of U.S. federal tax incentives for renewables through the extension of the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 Solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase-down period. This form of policy support has been very important over the last decade, and with the extensions, we believe that renewables are well positioned to support a higher-base opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case, not only through 2018, but into the next decade.
Together with the extension, we expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance for both wind and solar. For wind, the guidance is expected to be consistent with, and perhaps more constructive, to what has previously been in place, which would support an ability to continue to offer very attractive pricing to our customers into the next decade. The start of construction guidance for wind is likely to be released by the IRS over the next few months, while solar guidance is expected to follow later on, given that the COD deadline for the first step of the phase-down of the solar ITC is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
In turn, we expect the added planning stability provided by tax incentives to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis, with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are phased down.
We have seen significant wind turbine efficiency improvements over the last several years and more are expected over the next few years. Likewise, solar panel costs have fallen steadily, while efficiency has also improved substantially with even more advances expected over the next few years.
Solar balance system costs are also expected to experience significant reductions during the same period. Both wind and solar are well positioned to compete head-to-head with gas-fired generation technologies now and as we head into the next decade. Lower natural gas prices and environmental regulation are expected to continue to pressure existing coal facilities, and renewables are well situated as the shift away from coal continues. Not only do wind and solar continue to benefit from cost and efficiency improvements and the economic support of tax incentives, but renewables also help customers meet both state and potential federal environmental compliance obligations.
In addition, state-level renewable portfolio standards are now in place in 29 states and discussions of increasing the renewable requirements under these standards are continuing in certain of these states.
Despite the stay of the Clean Power Plan by the United States Supreme Court, we continue to believe that the regulatory trend in North America will continue to be towards supporting more renewable energy. We expect resource planning activities for increasingly stringent environmental rules and potential carbon emissions regulations, whether at the state or federal level, will help further support demand.
For these reasons, we expect some of our potential customers to be motivated, not only by the economics in new renewables but also by the consideration of current or potential future environmental compliance obligations such as the Clean Power Plan.
Due to the combination of these trends favoring the development of new renewables, the U.S. wind and solar market is expected to grow significantly into the next decade. We will continue to leverage our core strengths in solar and wind and invest in related areas such as energy storage in order to offer our customers innovative, low-cost and high-quality projects that we expect to further enhance our competitive position.
We believe that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
In addition, we expect our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new nontraditional customers, particularly in the form of commercial and industrial demand, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure power from clean generation resources.
Based on everything we see now, we expect to bring into service roughly 2,400 to 3,800 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame. The low end of that ranges matches what we expect to bring into the services for 2015 to 2016, one of our most successful origination periods to date, and is roughly 3 times what we indicated at our March 2015 Investor Conference.
On the U.S. solar side, the ITC extension may cause some customers to wait to sign contracts since the 30% ITC is in place for 2019. As such, we believe that a range of 400 to 1,300 megawatts is reasonable for the 2017 to 2018 time frame.
In part, this range reflects an expectation to continue to build upon our recent successes as we have been positively surprised by the amount of demand we have seen for 2016 build.
As a reminder, our 2015-2016 solar development program consists of over 1,300 megawatts, reflecting outstanding origination results for greenfield and early-stage development projects. However, we believe that some of this recent success may reflect the pulling forward of demand from future years. Overall, we expect a greater portion of new demand, particularly for solar, to  projects delivered in 2018 and beyond.
Over the last 8 years, we have successfully developed and acquired more than 880 megawatts of new renewables project in Canada. We continue to pursue development of new Canadian solar, wind and storage projects, and see potential for up to 300 megawatts of new Canadian wind development opportunities over the 2017-2018 period.
We are also contemplating repowering certain of our wind generation facilities, which will require new investments to be made to upgrade current equipment to the latest technology. On a project-level basis, the incremental earnings and cash flow generation potential from these repowering investments could be similar to a new build opportunity, given that we would be targeting projects that are not generating PTCs. However, this effort is still on its early stages and is contingent on IRS guidance that is expected to be released in the second quarter. We expect to be able to give a further update on where we are regarding this opportunity before the end of the year.
Energy Resources expectations for capital expenditures to support the 2017-2018 renewables development program are $7 billion to $9 billion, reflecting a midpoint of 4,100 megawatts of new projects over this time frame. These capital expenditure expectations are roughly the same as for our record-breaking 2015 and 2016 program.
While there is some uncertainty as to the timing of these new build opportunities, we expect a greater portion of new project demand, and in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations, while only a quarter of the way through 2016, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, most importantly, the tender of IRS start of construction guidance and its related impact on the timing of customer demand.
Similar to previous years, we remain committed to maintaining the strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities that supports our overall corporate credit position. We currently don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity to support our renewables build. As we discussed on the last call, our enthusiasm about our renewable growth prospects was a major driver of the increased expectations for next NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base that we announced in the middle of last year.
We continue to expect our renewables development program to support those expectations in our longer-term growth prospects. It is important to keep in mind that the greatest potential contribution to earnings of cash flow growth from these 2017 and 2018 development projects are for 2019 and beyond.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, and cash available for distribution was $38 million, up $71 million and $53 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to portfolio growth. Before accounting for debt service, cash available for distribution was $112 million. New projects added $70 million of adjusted EBITDA and $55 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, the existing assets in the NEP portfolio operated well and benefited from a year-over-year improvement in wind resource. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was roughly 100% of the long-term average versus 86% in the first quarter of 2015. Total resource was also strong during the quarter, but the year-over-year impact was small. Adjusted EBITDA from existing projects increased by $5 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The comparable increase in cash available for distribution was slightly greater due to favorable debt refinancing activities and the timing of tax equity contributions. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $6 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $636 million or $1.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $715 million and $1.55 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased 1% per share compared to the first quarter of 2015.
The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed just after the end of the first quarter. This transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million, and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $107 million that will be excluded from NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings. We expect continued opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. In addition, the strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of low-risk, long-term contracted assets, potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners.
Our continued focus on recycling capital at Energy Resources, whether through third-party asset sales or drop-downs to NEP, together with what we believe is an outstanding regulated opportunity set at FPL, continue to support our ability to balance growth across our 2 main businesses.
Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Looking further ahead, we also continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%.  As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveat, including, but not limited, the normal weather and operating conditions. 
Turning now to NEP. The acquisition of the Seiling I & II projects during the first quarter has added to what we already consider to be a solid run rate and has further increased NEP's flexibility for the balance of the year. We expect the current portfolio post the acquisition of Seiling I & II to support a CAFD run rate of $210 million to $240 million, which is within the range of our December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectations of $210 million to $290 million.
Due to our ability to raise approximately $287 million in equity to acquire these projects, their contribution to cash available for distribution and the success we've had under the ATM program, we now have more liquidity and debt capacity that we had coming into the year. We continue to evaluate the optimal long-term capital structure for NEP, and our current thinking is that the portfolio can support a holdco leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x project distributions after debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. As a result, we have flexibility as to how we finance our next acquisition and can be opportunistic regarding our approach to further growth opportunities for the balance of the year. We have included a new slide in the appendix for today's presentation with additional details regarding NEP's current incremental holdco debt capacity.
The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and our net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning, the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. 
In summary, we continue to believe that NEE and NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. We remain very focused on the execution objectives for the year and we are off to a good start.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open the line for questions."

Stephen, a couple of things. Like last time when the PTC extension was passed by Congress, we're all awaiting guidance on that start of construction, how long out into the future can you build and still get those PTCs. In addition, it looks like the IRS may provide guidance on something relating to repowerings. There's no -- I mean, we don't know that that's going to happen yet or not. We've talked about repowerings in the past with investors. We have repowered some of our sites in the past. We've torn turbines down and put up new turbines. What we're actually looking at is the possibility of enhancing some of our older sites and still being able to qualify for new production tax credits. So it's difficult at this point to say how big the opportunity is. And it's actually difficult to say exactly what the IRS guidance would have to look like for us to feel comfortable. The IRS has current guidance on, what I'll call -- if you have an old piece of equipment and you refurbish that equipment to some extent, there are some cases where that new refurbished equipment could get all of the tax benefits of a new piece of equipment. And so that guidance is already out there. How and when it might apply to what we're talking about is something that we're interested in. So at this point, it's an opportunity. It could be a small opportunity or it could be a significant opportunity. I think, we will absolutely have more to say on this if it's a decent opportunity on the next call."

NET, I mean, we're still -- obviously, it hasn't been a year yet since we closed it. And when we did close and we announced it, one of the things we said is, we were excited about all of the opportunities, not only what we thought were identified opportunities, but all of the unidentified opportunities, because it was a vast pipeline system inside of Texas. Since then, we've seen continued activity from the Mexican front, and we're not in Mexico, just to clear that point up. But from the Mexican front, that they continued to import a lot of gas and have a lot of needs. That's creating opportunities, opportunities that we hope will actually turn into something for NET because in particular, our pipes are -- NET pipes are well placed in Texas to be able to provide to Mexico. In terms of the expansion projects, there were a couple of projects. There were some smaller projects that we expected to get completed during the first 12 or 18 months. I don't know that many of those projects have fallen off the radar. As a matter of fact, there's been more projects that have been added on what I'll call the small-scale optimization, which is good, which is good for NET. And then there were a couple of larger expansion projects that we' had until -- under the terms of the agreement, until the end of this year to figure out whether they were going to come in or not, and those appear okay at this point. One of them actually appears quite favorable. I think, we're not going to know the pace of actually signing something up with -- particularly, with the Mexican government, isn't as quick as we would like to see. So we would like for -- we'll probably see more activity, and we'll have more to say towards the end of the year. There is a $200 million incentive payment to the owners -- previous owners of NET should those expansion projects come online, and obviously, if they don't, that saves NET $200 million. So I think the previous owners and us are all well incented to get the expansion projects done. But it's just a little too early to figure out how we're going to do by the end of the year."

NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and have made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter ad",4394,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and have made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10% and the company continued to deliver significant growth in cash flow from operations against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.
NextEra Energy Partners grew per-unit distributions by 55% versus the prior year comparable period and continued to add to the solid run rate with which it entered the year by successfully acquiring 2 new wind projects.
At Florida Power & Light, growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business to further advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. Our major capital initiatives remain on track, and I am pleased to report that the new Port Everglades Next Generation Clean Energy Center entered service on April 1, on budget and 2 months ahead of schedule. In addition, construction began on FPL's 3 74.5-megawatt utility-scale solar PV projects. As a reminder, these projects leverage existing infrastructure in prior development work that cost effectively add more solar to our system and, upon expected delivery by the end of the year, will roughly triple FPL's solar capacity.
Not only will these projects help to further diversify FPL's fuel mix, but they also demonstrate FPL's commitment to providing customers low-cost and reliable clean energy solutions. Due in part to our efforts to modernize our existing generation, at the end of the first quarter we were pleased to deliver FPL's fourth rate decrease in the past 16 months. On March 15, we filed our formal request for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement.
Our 2017 to 2020 base rate proposal is largely consistent with what we indicated in the test year letter. Under this proposal, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL estimates its typical residential bill in 2020 will still be lower than what it was in 2006 and will remain among the lowest in the state and nation based on current bill comparisons.
At Energy Resources, contributions from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio and investments in natural gas pipelines drove strong financial results for the quarter. Since the last call, the team signed additional PPAs for additional -- for approximately 250 megawatts of U.S. wind for post 2016 delivery and closed on an acquisition of a 100-megawatt wind facility located in New Mexico that began operations in 2009.
We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the North American renewables business have never been stronger. And I will provide an update on our latest expectations for our long-term contracted renewables development program later in the call.
In addition, earlier this month we increased our participation in the Sabal Trail natural gas pipeline project through the incremental purchase of a 9.5% equity interest from Spectra Energy, bringing our total ownership share from 33% to 42.5%. At NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to believe that a strong sponsor with a highly visible runway for future growth is a core driver of the NEP value proposition. During the quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of the Seiling I & II wind projects from Energy Resources, totaling approximately 300 megawatts.
Despite challenging capital market conditions, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition was purchased by the underwriter at the time of announcement. The over-allotment option was also subsequently exercised in full. 
In addition to NEP's success in accessing the equity markets to continue to grow its renewables generation portfolio, first quarter operating performance was excellent and cash available for distribution was slightly better than our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.31875 per common unit or $1.275 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 55% over the prior year.
At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the first quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $393 million, or $0.85 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.05 or approximately 6% year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.6% over the same quarter last year. During the quarter we invested roughly $1.2 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion of capital expenditures that we expect for the full year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We entered 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million, and we utilized $176 million during the first quarter in order to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5% that I just mentioned.
This was slightly better than our expectations, leaving us with a balance of $87 million which can be utilized in the reminder of 2016.
Since the start of our current rate agreement in 2013, we have utilized a larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year due to the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different.
We continue to expect to utilize the balance of the reserve amortization this year to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance, along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
The Florida economy remains solid. A focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continue to encourage business expansion and additional hiring. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped to an 8-year low of 4.9% in March, down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and below the national rate of 5.0%. Over the same time period, the number of jobs increased 2.9% and over 1 million jobs have now been added in the state since December 2010.
As an indicator of new construction, new building permits have shown strong growth and the most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 6.0% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow, and the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post-recession highs.
During the first quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 64,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, which had a favorable impact on sales of 1.3%. However, customer growth was more than offset by a 1.4% decline in sales due to mild weather during the quarter. Also, compared to the same quarter last year, underlying usage per customer declined 0.4% on a weather-normalized basis. Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year.
After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% year-over-year. The number of inactive accounts reached its lowest levels in more than a decade and stronger growth and new service accounts during the quarter reflected healthy levels of construction.
As I mentioned earlier, on March 15 we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2017 through 2020 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $866 million starting January 2017, $262 million starting January 2018 and $209 million upon commissioning of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020.
We are proud to offer customers service that ranks among the cleanest and most reliable in the country, with typical residential bills among the lowest in the nation and 15% lower than 2006.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at about 2.8% per year from January 2016 through the end of 2020, which is about the same as the expected rate of inflation.
The Florida Public Service Commission has established a definitive schedule for this proceeding, beginning with quality of service hearings in June, rebuttal testimony from interveners and staff in July, rebutting testimony from FPL on August and technical hearings in late August and early September. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. 
The nearly 9,000 employees of FPL have worked hard and thoughtfully for many years following a consistent strategy that has led to FPL's current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. The 2013 settlement agreement has benefited customers by eliminating the need for a general base rate increase for 4 years, while at the same time providing stability and certainty around the level of customer bills.
We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer, and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $224 million or $0.48 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $306 million or $0.66 per share, while adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year. As a reminder, our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the Corporate & Others segment. While our first quarter 2015 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development.
Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. New investments added $0.14 per share, including $0.10 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. These results reflect approximately 1,840 megawatts of new renewables projects placed into service during or after the first quarter of 2015. New investments in natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share, reflecting the net addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. Wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 87% in the first quarter of 2015, and this favorable comparison was the principal driver of increased contributions from existing assets of $0.04 per share. Partially offsetting these results were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, increased corporate expenses primarily related to growth in the business, and the impact of share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. Over the last decade, we have invested roughly $23 billion in wind and solar generation. Last year alone, the team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects, making 2015 our second best year ever for renewables origination performance. With these additions, along with the 100-megawatt acquisition since the last call that I mentioned earlier, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program is over 4,000 megawatts. This result is roughly 500 megawatts above the midpoint of the range for these years that we discussed at our investor conference last March, making 2015 and 2016 the most successful 2-year period for renewables development in our history.
Energy Resources continues to benefit from growing demand for renewables and has built what we believe is the largest and highest quality renewables development pipeline in the space. Driving that growth is a number of favorable trends. First, Congress at the end of last year provided increased certainty of U.S. federal tax incentives for renewables through the extension of the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a 5-year phase-down period. This form of policy support has been very important over the last decade, and with the extensions we believe that renewables are well positioned to support a higher base opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case, not only through 2018, but into the next decade.
Together with the extension, we expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance for both wind and solar. For wind, the guidance is expected to be consistent with, and perhaps more constructive, to what has previously been in place, which would support an ability to continue to offer very attractive pricing to our customers into the next decade. The start of construction guidance for wind is likely to be released by the IRS over the next few months, while solar guidance is expected to follow later on, given that the COD deadline for the first step of the phase-down of the solar ITC is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
In turn, we expect the added planning stability provided by tax incentives to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are phased down.
We have seen significant wind turbine efficiency improvements over the last several years and more are expected over the next few years. Likewise, solar panel costs have fallen steadily, while efficiency has also improved substantially with even more advances expected over the next few years.
Solar balance system costs are also expected to experience significant reductions during the same period. Both wind and solar are well positioned to compete head-to-head with gas-fired generation technologies now and as we head into the next decade. Lower natural gas prices and environmental regulation are expected to continue to pressure existing coal facilities, and renewables are well situated as the shift away from coal continues. Not only do wind and solar continue to benefit from cost and efficiency improvements and the economic support of tax incentives, but renewables also help customers meet both state and potential federal environmental compliance obligations.
In addition, state-level renewable portfolio standards are now in place in 29 states and discussions of increasing the renewable requirements under these standards are continuing in certain of these states.
Despite the stay of the Clean Power Plan by the United States Supreme Court, we continue to believe that the regulatory trend in North America will continue to be towards supporting more renewable energy. We expect resource planning activities for increasingly stringent environmental rules and potential carbon emissions regulations, whether at the state or federal level, will help further support demand.
For these reasons, we expect some of our potential customers to be motivated not only by the economics in new renewables but also by the consideration of current or potential future environmental compliance obligations such as the Clean Power Plan.
Due to the combination of these trends favoring the development of new renewables, the U.S. wind and solar market is expected to grow significantly into the next decade. We will continue to leverage our core strengths in solar and wind and invest in related areas, such as energy storage, in order to offer our customers innovative, low-cost and high-quality projects that we expect to further enhance our competitive position.
We believe that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
In addition, we expect our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new, nontraditional customers, particularly in the form of commercial and industrial demand, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure power from clean generation resources.
Based on everything we see now, we expect to bring into service roughly 2,400 to 3,800 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame. The low end of that range matches what we expect to bring into services for 2015 to 2016, one of our most successful origination periods to date, and is roughly 3 times what we indicated at our March 2015 Investor Conference.
On the U.S. solar side, the ITC extension may cause some customers to wait to sign contracts since the 30% ITC is in place through 2019. As such, we believe that a range of 400 to 1,300 megawatts is reasonable for the 2017 to 2018 time frame.
In part, this range reflects an expectation to continue to build upon our recent successes as we have been positively surprised by the amount of demand we have seen for 2016 build.
As a reminder, our 2015 to 2016 solar development program consists of over 1,300 megawatts, reflecting outstanding origination results for greenfield and early-stage development projects. However, we believe that some of this recent success may reflect the pulling forward of demand from future years. Overall, we expect a greater portion of new demand, particularly for solar, to  be projects delivered in 2018 and beyond.
Over the last 8 years we have successfully developed and acquired more than 880 megawatts of new renewables projects in Canada. We continue to pursue development of new Canadian solar, wind and storage projects and see potential for up to 300 megawatts of new Canadian wind development opportunities over the 2017 to 2018 period.
We are also contemplating repowering certain of our existing wind generation facilities, which will require new investments to be made to upgrade current equipment to the latest technology. On a project-level basis, the incremental earnings and cash flow generation potential from these repowering investments could be similar to a new build opportunity, given that we would be targeting projects that are not generating PTCs. However, this effort is still in its early stages and is contingent on IRS guidance that is expected to be released in the second quarter. We expect to be able to give a further update on where we are regarding this opportunity before the end of the year.
Energy Resources' expectations for capital expenditures to support the 2017 and 2018 renewables development program are $7 billion to $9 billion, reflecting a midpoint of 4,100 megawatts of new projects over this time frame. These capital expenditure expectations are roughly the same as for our record-breaking 2015 and 2016 program.
While there is some uncertainty as to the timing of these new build opportunities, we expect a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations while only a quarter of the way through 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, most importantly, the tenor of IRS start of construction guidance and its related impact on the timing of customer demand.
Similar to previous years, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities that supports our overall corporate credit position. We currently don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity to support our renewables build. As we discussed on the last call, our enthusiasm about our renewable growth prospects was a major driver of the increased expectations for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base that we announced in the middle of last year.
We continue to expect our renewables development program to support those expectations in our longer-term growth prospects. It is important to keep in mind that the greatest potential contribution to earnings of cash flow growth from these 2017 and 2018 development projects are for 2019 and beyond.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, and cash available for distribution was $38 million, up $71 million and $53 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to portfolio growth. Before accounting for debt service, cash available for distribution was $112 million. New projects added $70 million of adjusted EBITDA and $55 million of cash available for distribution. 
After accounting for the results of new project additions, the existing assets in the NEP portfolio operated well and benefited from a year-over-year improvement in wind resource. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was roughly 100% of the long-term average versus 86% in the first quarter of 2015. Solar resource was also strong during the quarter, but the year-over-year impact was small. Adjusted EBITDA from existing projects increased by $5 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The comparable increase in cash available for distribution was slightly greater due to favorable debt refinancing activities and the timing of tax equity contributions. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $6 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $636 million or $1.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $715 million and $1.55 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased 1% per share compared to the first quarter of 2015.
The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed just after the end of the first quarter. This transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $107 million that will be excluded from NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings. 
We expect continued opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. In addition, the strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of low-risk, long-term contracted assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners.
Our continued focus on recycling capital at Energy Resources, whether through third-party asset sales or drop-downs to NEP, together with what we believe is an outstanding regulated opportunity set at FPL, continue to support our ability to balance growth across our 2 main businesses.
Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2016 we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Looking further ahead, we also continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%.  As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions. 
Turning now to NEP. The acquisition of the Seiling I & II projects during the first quarter has added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate and has further increased NEP's flexibility for the balance of the year. We expect the current portfolio post the acquisition of Seiling I & II to support a CAFD run rate of $210 million to $240 million, which is within the range of our December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectations of $210 million to $290 million.
Due to our ability to raise approximately $287 million in equity to acquire these projects, their contribution to cash available for distribution and the success we've had under the ATM program, we now have more liquidity and debt capacity than we had coming into the year. We continue to evaluate the optimal long-term capital structure for NEP, and our current thinking is that the portfolio can support a holdco leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x project distributions after debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. As a result, we have flexibility as to how we finance our next acquisition and can be opportunistic regarding our approach to further growth opportunities for the balance of the year. We have included a new slide in the appendix to today's presentation with additional details regarding NEP's current incremental holdco debt capacity.
The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. 
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.
As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. 
In summary, we continue to believe that NEE and NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. We remain very focused on the execution objectives for the year and we are off to a good start.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open the line for questions."

Stephen, a couple of things. Like last time, when the PTC extension was passed by Congress, we're all awaiting guidance on the start of construction, how long out into the future can you build and still get those PTCs. In addition, it looks like the IRS may provide guidance on something relating to repowerings. There's no -- I mean, we don't know that that's going to happen yet or not. We've talked about repowerings in the past with investors. We have repowered some of our sites in the past. We've torn turbines down and put up new turbines. What we're actually looking at is the possibility of enhancing some of our older sites and still being able to qualify for new production tax credits. 
So it's difficult at this point to say how big the opportunity is. And it's actually difficult to say exactly what the IRS guidance would have to look like for us to feel comfortable. The IRS has current guidance on what I'll call -- if you have an old piece of equipment and you refurbish that equipment to some extent, there are some cases where that new refurbished equipment could get all of the tax benefits of a new piece of equipment. And so that guidance is already out there. How and when it might apply to what we're talking about is something that we're interested in. 
So at this point it's an opportunity. It could be a small opportunity or it could be a significant opportunity. I think we will absolutely have more to say on this, if it's a decent opportunity, on the next call."

Obviously, like you, we've seen a lot of folks build in Texas. Look, it's easy to build in Texas. The permitting is favorable. The interconnections are favorable. I think you're probably right in what you're intimating, that at some point in the future there is going to have to be another wave of significant transmission build in Texas in order to accommodate new wind. 
But it's -- the other thing to look at in Texas, actually, Stephen, is solar. We've seen, and I'm sure you and others have seen, that there's -- there appears to be an early wave of solar in Texas at prices that appear very attractive. And so it's not just wind.

And when we did close and we announced it, one of the things we said is we were excited about all of the opportunities, not only what we thought were i",393,"So a couple things. NET, I mean, we're still -- obviously it hasn't been a year yet since we closed it. And when we did close and we announced it, one of the things we said is we were excited about all of the opportunities, not only what we thought were identified opportunities, but all of the unidentified opportunities, because it was a vast pipeline system inside of Texas. Since then we've seen continued activity from the Mexican front, and we're not in Mexico, just to clear that point up, but from the Mexican front, that they continue to import a lot of gas and have a lot of needs. That's creating opportunities, opportunities that we hope will actually turn into something for NET. Because in particular our pipes are -- NET pipes are well placed in Texas to be able to provide to Mexico. 
In terms of the expansion projects, there were a couple of projects. There were some smaller projects that we expected to get completed during the first 12 or 18 months. I don't know that many of those projects have fallen off the radar. As a matter of fact, there's been more projects that have been added on what I'll call the small scale optimization, which is good, which is good for NET. And then there were a couple of larger expansion projects that we had until -- under the terms of the agreement, until the end of this year to figure out whether they were going to come in or not. And those appear okay at this point. One of them actually appears quite favorable. 
I think we're not going to know the pace of actually signing something up with -- particularly with the Mexican government, isn't as quick as we would like to see. So we would like for -- we'll probably see more activity, and we'll have more to say towards the end of the year. 
There is a $200 million incentive payment to the owners -- previous owners of NET should those expansion projects come online. And obviously if they don't that saves NET $200 million. So I think the previous owners and us are all well incented to get the expansion projects done. But it's just a little too early to figure out how we're going to do by the end of the year."

270586,374028299,1013263,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior y",3862,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter driven by new investments and Energy Resources. For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations.
NEP grew per-unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of 2 high-quality win facilities just after the end of the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court that disallow investments and long-term natural gas supplies.
Aside from the impact of this position, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results. We are on the regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed will roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced the plan to acquire and phase out one of the highest greenhouse gas emitting coal-fired plants located in Martin County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the banner clean energy center that is expected to enter service in mid-2019.
Earlier this month, the FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power award for ranking the highest residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 core is our highest ever in the study's history.
As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate release beginning in January 27 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the preceding thus far in just a moment.
Energy Resources continue to benefit from strong contributions from new investments. And this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contract to renewables project in 2016. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.
During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the win PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction Safe Harbor of up to 4 years, increased from the 2 years Safe Harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact of timing on customer demand as a result of this increased tinner, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already considered to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history.
In addition, the IRS provided a guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas win projects for roughly 327 megawatts to be completed by the end of 2017.
We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables have there been stronger and that the capabilities of our development organizations, together with our purchasing power, scale and operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage place us to an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year growth substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NAB board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis.
NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the SEDAR Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE Technology. These high quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnership's flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic as the future growth in 2016.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned heading into the second half of the year.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior-year comparable quarter, but was offset by the impact of the Woodford project Gas reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers, with regulatory capital employed growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year.
Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that flows into third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown cogeneration facility is a 330-megawatt power plant located in Indiantown Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposed this purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facilities and that would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017, and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers. Along with the Cedar Bay, this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of 2 of the highest greenhouse gas emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader.
During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, and we appreciate that PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risks.
Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through a feature fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements year-to-date for this investment as compared to settle natural gas prices over the same period of time.
Going forward, the Woodford project investment has been removed from customer recovery and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes, will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserved amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.
During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization, which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx and own expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to Florida's economy. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs has been added since 2010. The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level in the case Shiller index for South Florida home price is up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remained near postrecession highs.
FPL second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2%, and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative half a percent per year as we saw last year.
As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony in detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, 9 quality of service areas were conducted across the state overwhelming majority of participants both positively about the service they received from FPL. Intervenors and staff testimony were filed earlier this month and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week, on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September, and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments of long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.
Let may now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contract to renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share, a favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure, was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter.
Wind resources, roughly 92% of the long-term average, essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slides, including the impact of unfavorable market conditions in our upstream gas infrastructure activities and increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth from the business.
As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phase down period was further enhance during the quarter by IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain Safe Harbor provisions, the guidance extends the PTC for an additional 4-year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanied slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the Safe Harbor to precure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020, will qualify for 100% of the PTC. As compared to the 2-year Safe Harbor peered that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increase tinner to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as the may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years.
For solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on, given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the solar ITC phase down is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost decline and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are ultimately phased down.
In addition to the 4-year started construction Safe Harbor for wind, the IRS also really status for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms 2 key points. First, it explains that the 5% Safe Harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80/20 rule, by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's turbans total value. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving forward with repowering 2 of our Texas wind assets. We are also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential signs of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year.
Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowers to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for next year [ph] energy through 2018.
The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contract to renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015 and construction activities remain on track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.
From this space, the expectations we discussed in the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame are unchanged.
Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this timeframe to approximately 5,075 megawatts.
Including 327-megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewables backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities.
While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remain subject to a number of uncertainties.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remains on track. Park approval was received earlier this year and we continue to expect that in-service date in mid-2017.
NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor ship around both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline project, in which we are expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million, and cash available for distributions was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter.
Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and roughly in line with the prior year comparable quarter.
Second quarter wind resource for that NEP portfolio was roughly 91% of the long-term average which was similar to the prior year comparable period. As reminder, these results were net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.
IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slides.
As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition of the SEDAR Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of debt with the balance of purchase price funded with cash on hand and to withdraw other a project level revolving credit facility. The use of debt is consistent with our target at the NEP for a long-term capital structure, utilizing leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental [indiscernible] capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million.
Looking ahead, NextEra Energy Partners expects to get you to be flexible and opportunistic as the future growth opportunities in financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015.
For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect the first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standard change on March 30, 2016, is expected to be largely representative of a full-year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity.
At the corporate level, our base case planning continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Corning natural gas generation assets located in earth closed at the beginning of the quarter generating net cash proceeds approximately $456 million. In addition, we continue to expect the opportunities to recycle capital through a potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long term contracted and rate regulated.
We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer-term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35, with more of our growth for a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we seen now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter.
For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate of 2014 base to 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividend per share of 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of the evidence per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of the SEDAR Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $600 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previous stated December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million. We are also updated in the December 31, 2016 run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $700 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.31 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable February 2017.
In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are of to a strong start to the first 2 quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one of the best in the industry and we are well-positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the lines for questions"

I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for be powering. I'd say that anywhere from may be 3 to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at, has the permitting change? Has the environmental regulations change? What are the land leases look like? What discussions can we have with the customers? What are the old PPAs look like if it's a merchant project? How comfortable are we with revenues and/or hedges that we have to take a look at? So we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects. But I can tell you that in detail, at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with. And most of what we're seeing, again, it's still very early because all these things are just like their own mini projects, most of what we're seeing we think would likely go COD in '19 and '20. There's obviously, going to be a portion if there were in '17 and '18 and unfortunately, it's going to be probably dribs and drabs like you have today when we announce this 327 megawatts. But a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense, it would be in '19 and '20. So a very small piece and we're very happy to enhance it today because it certainly wasn't something that we were thinking about 6 months ago but you probably continue to hear from us, hey, this works and this doesn't work and so on."

We still think that what moves or transactions that get negotiated with our friends south of the border always take a little bit longer than what you would expect, but we just still think that there are opportunities. I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities like we did in NEP Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border, and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in what I call, the acquisition market, which is primarily the MLP's participate in. So we're doing some greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream.

So take a look at our portfolio, obviously, if a project is not production is no longer tax credits, it's no longer generating Production tax credits, that makes it a pretty good candidate for repower. Why? Well, because if you're going to repower before the production tax credits have expire, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits. Having said that, projects that still have 1 or 2 years of Production Tax Credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up 2 years old Production Tax Credit's and getting another 10 years of Production Tax Credit as an example in 2020 when you can get 100% PTCs for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. Projects that what we call, convertible investment tax credits. What, other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had Production Tax Credits, those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project finance. So either one of those would work. There's not a big difference, whether a project has already been dropped for sold to NextEra Energy Partners, certainly NextEra Energy Partners could do this. Projects that are merchant have 1 last difficulty associated with them, that is you though have a PPA counter party to have a discussion with. Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties and they love the idea of repowering. I'm not suggesting that those are going to get repowered but at least a discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbine. So that's kind of the things -- that probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine something -- somebody as a candidate."

I mean, the reality is, we have several gigawatts, as Armando said, of opportunities, but each project is a completely new development and it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases and you have a transmission in your connects, but they are still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects. So we have a big team on it, we're running through it. It is as Armando said, if it's up to -- if it's as many as 3 or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us and we're, as always, on something that we have been working. The other point that I just want to make is we've been working on it for about 90 days. And so, we are -- I think we have major men's progress actually in the last few months on it. And we're going to have more clarity on each of the calls that we do as we go forward. It is becoming clear though, for sure, that most of the activity is going to be '18, '19 and '20.

270586,374028299,1013639,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior y",3864,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter driven by new investments and Energy Resources. For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. NEP grew per unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of 2 high-quality wind facilities just after the end of the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund to customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to disallow investments and long-term natural gas supplies.
Aside from the impact of this decision, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results. We are on a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced the plan to acquire and phase out one of the state's highest greenhouse gas-emitting coal-fired plants located in Martin County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to enter service in mid-2019.
Earlier this month, FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power award for ranking highest in residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 score is our highest ever in the study's history. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the proceedings thus far in just a moment.
Energy Resources continued to benefit from strong contributions from new investments, and this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources, and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.
During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the wind PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction safe harbor of up to 4 years, increased from the 2-year safe harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact to timing of customer demand as a result of this increased tenure, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already considered to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history.
In addition, the IRS also provided guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects for roughly 327 megawatts that can be -- to be completed by the end of 2017.
We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables growth have never been stronger, and that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage, place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year drove substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis.
NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE technology. These high-quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnership's flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic as to future growth in 2016.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well positioned heading into the second half of the year.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior year comparable quarter but was offset by the impact of the Woodford Project Gas Reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers with regulatory capital employed growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year.
Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that closed in the third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown cogeneration facility is a 330-megawatt power plant located in Indiantown, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposes to purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017, and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers.
Along with the Cedar Bay, this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of 2 of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader.
During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford Project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, and we appreciate the PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risk.
Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through future fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements accrued to date for this investment as compared to settled natural gas prices over the same period of time. Going forward, the Woodford Project investment has been removed from customer recovery, and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.
During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization, which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to Florida's economy. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was up approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs have been added since 2010. The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level, and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home price is up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remained near postrecession highs.
FPL's second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2% and increased weather-normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather-normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year as we saw last year.
As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, 9 quality of service hearings were conducted across the state, and an overwhelming majority of participants spoke positively about the service they received from FPL. Intervenor and staff testimony were filed earlier this month, and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September, and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments of long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement, and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share. A favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll-off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter.
Wind resources, roughly 92% of the long-term average, essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slides, including the impact of unfavorable market conditions on our upstream gas infrastructure activities and increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth from the business.
As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced during the quarter by IS -- IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor provisions, the guidance extends the PTC for an additional 4-year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanying slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the safe harbor to precure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020 will qualify for 100% of the PTC. As compared to the 2-year safe harbor period that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increased tenure to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as to whether it may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years.
For solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on, given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the solar ITC phasedown is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are ultimately phased down.
In addition to the 4-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms 2 key points. First, it explains that the 5% safe harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80-20 rule, by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving forward with repowering 2 of our Texas wind assets. We are also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential size of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year.
Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowerings to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2018.
The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contracted renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015, and construction activities remain on track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year. From this base, the expectations we discussed in the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame are unchanged.
Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this time frame to approximately 5,075 megawatts.
Including 327-megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewables backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities.
While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remains subject to a number of uncertainties.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remains on track. FERC approval was received earlier this year, and we continue to expect that in-service date in mid-2017.
NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor ship around both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline project in which our expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process, and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million, and cash available for distributions was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter.
Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and CAFD roughly in line with the prior year comparable quarter.
Second quarter wind resource for the NEP portfolio was roughly 91% of the long-term average, which was similar to the prior year comparable period. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.
IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of holdco debt with the balance of the purchase price funded with cash on hand and through a draw under a project-level revolving credit facility. The use of holdco debt is consistent with our target at NEP for a long-term capital structure, utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million.
Looking ahead, NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities in financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015.
For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect the first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standard change on March 30, 2016, is expected to be largely representative of a full year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity.
At the corporate level, our base case planning continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed at the beginning of the quarter generating net cash proceeds approximately $456 million. In addition, we continue to expect the opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long term contracted and rate regulated.
We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35, with more of our growth for a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter.
For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $260 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previously stated December 31, 2016, portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million. We are also updating the December 31, 2016, run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $760 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable on February 2017.
In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are off to a strong start through the first 2 quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one of the best in the industry and we are well positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the lines for questions."

Obviously, a question that everybody wants to know, so they can give some size to the program. I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for repowering. I'd say that anywhere from maybe 3 to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally, and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at has the permitting changed? Have the environmental regulations changed? What did the land leases look like? What discussions can we have with the customers? What did the old PPAs look like, if it's a merchant project? How comfortable are we with revenues and/or hedges that we have to take a look at? So we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects. But I can tell you that, in detail, at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with. And most of what we are seeing -- again, it's still very early because all these things are just like their own mini projects, most of what we're seeing we think would likely go COD in '19 and '20. There is obviously going to be a portion, if they work, that are going to be available in '17 and '18, and unfortunately, it's going to be probably be dribs and drabs like you have today when we announced these 327 megawatts. But a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense, it would be in '19 and '20. So a very small piece, and we're very happy to announce it today because it was certainly wasn't something that we were thinking about 6 months ago, but you'll probably continue to hear from us that, hey, this works, and this doesn't work and so on."

So I think a couple of points on that. First, when we acquired the NET portfolio last year in Texas, one of the things that we said was we were happy to be acquiring an interstate portfolio of pipelines, and we thought it would give us opportunities to expand in that area, and that we believe that the additional gas requirements coming out of Mexico would present us opportunities down the line. We still think that. It's what moves our transactions that get negotiated with our friends south of the border always take a little bit longer than what we would expect, but we just still think that there are opportunities. I would -- I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities like we did in NET Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border, and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in, what I'll call, the acquisition market, which is primarily the MLP's participate in. So we're doing some greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream. And we are certainly hopeful that from now through 2020 that we would have another project, another pipeline project to be able to announce, but we -- I wouldn't say that there's anything in the near term that we would be announcing."

Well, because if you're going to repower before the Production Tax Credits have expired, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits. Having said that, projects that still have 1 or 2 years of Production Tax Credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up 2 years old Production Tax Credits and getting another 10 years of Production Tax Credit, as an example, in 2020 when you can get 100% PTCs for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. Projects that what we call, the convertible investment tax credit, what other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had Production Tax Credits. Those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project financed, so either one of those would work. There's not a big difference, whether a project has already been dropped or sold to NextEra Energy Partners. Certainly, NextEra Energy Partners could do this. Projects that are merchant have one less difficulty associated with them. That is you don't have a PPA counterparty to have a discussion with. Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties, and they love the idea of repowering. I am not suggesting that those are going to get repowered, but at least the discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbines. So that's kind of the things -- probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine something -- somebody as a candidate."

It's a fiscal hedge. And so we think there's a lot of value there for customers. With the commission thought that unanimously, and the court made it clear that they weren't really passing a judgment on whether or not it was a good idea; just that they didn't believe that the commission had the authority under the current legislative construct to be able to make that ruling.

I mean, the reality is we have several gigawatts, as Armando said, of opportunities, but each project is a completely new development. And it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases, and you have a transmission interconnects, but there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects. So we have a big team on it. We're running through it. It's -- it is, as Armando said, if it's up to -- if it's as many as 3 or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us. And we're, as always, on something that we've been working. The other point I just wanted to make is we've been working on it for about 90 days.

The reality is that the cooling canals have operated as designed. There is no impact on the local drinking water wells. There's no pollution going into Biscayne Bay. There is a concentration of saltwater below the cooling canals that has moved through the limestone. That was frankly anticipated during the original design of the canals. Everybody knew that was going to occur. It's a question of how far. We've now identified because we now have the technology to identify how far some of that saltwater has migrated. And we have a plan in place, working very closely with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Miami-Dade authorities and others to mitigate that plan. It's fact-based. It's science-based. We're going to undertake that. We're waiting on permits to able to do some of that. And the cost associated with that is the cost associated with operating the plant.

270586,374028299,1013840,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior y",3865,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter driven by new investments and Energy Resources. For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. NEP grew per unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of 2 high-quality wind facilities just after the end of the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we had previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund to customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to disallow investments in long-term natural gas supplies.
Aside from the impact of this decision, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results. We are on a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced the plan to acquire and phase out one of the state's highest greenhouse gas-emitting coal-fired plants located in Martin County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to enter service in mid-2019.
Earlier this month, FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power award for ranking highest in residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 score is our highest ever in the study's history. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the proceedings thus far in just a moment.
Energy Resources continued to benefit from strong contributions from new investments, and this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources, and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.
During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the wind PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction safe harbor of up to 4 years, increased from the 2-year safe harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact to timing of customer demand as a result of this increased tenure, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already considered to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history.
In addition, the IRS also provided guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects for roughly 327 megawatts that can be -- to be completed by the end of 2017.
We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables growth have never been stronger, and that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage, place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year drove substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis.
NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE technology. These high-quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnership's flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic as to future growth in 2016.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well positioned heading into the second half of the year.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior year comparable quarter but was offset by the impact of the Woodford Project Gas Reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers with regulatory capital employed growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year.
Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that closed in the third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown cogeneration facility is a 330-megawatt power plant located in Indiantown, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposes to purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017, and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers.
Along with Cedar Bay, this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of 2 of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader.
During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford Project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, and we appreciate the PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risk.
Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through future fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements accrued to date for this investment as compared to settled natural gas prices over the same period of time. Going forward, the Woodford Project investment has been removed from customer recovery, and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.
During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization, which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to Florida's economy. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was up approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs have been added since 2010. The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level, and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home price is up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remained near postrecession highs.
FPL's second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2% and increased weather-normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather-normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year as we saw last year.
As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, 9 quality of service hearings were conducted across the state, and an overwhelming majority of participants spoke positively about the service they received from FPL. Intervenor and staff testimony were filed earlier this month, and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September, and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments of long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement, and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share. A favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll-off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter.
Wind resources were roughly 92% of the long-term average, essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slides, including the impact of unfavorable market conditions on our upstream gas infrastructure activities and increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business.
As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced during the quarter by IS -- IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor provisions, the guidance extends the PTC for an additional 4-year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanying slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the safe harbor to precure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020 will qualify for 100% of the PTC. As compared to the 2-year safe harbor period that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increased tenure to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as to whether it may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years.
For solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on, given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the solar ITC phasedown is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are ultimately phased down.
In addition to the 4-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms 2 key points. First, it explains that the 5% safe harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80-20 rule, by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving forward with repowering 2 of our Texas wind assets. We are also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential size of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year.
Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowerings to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2018.
The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contracted renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015, and construction activities remain on track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year. From this base, the expectations we discussed in the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame are unchanged.
Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this time frame to approximately 575 megawatts.
Including 327-megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewables backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities.
While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remains subject to a number of uncertainties.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remains on track. FERC approval was received earlier this year, and we continue to expect that in-service date in mid-2017.
NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline project in which our expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process, and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million, and cash available for distributions was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter.
Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and CAFD roughly in line with the prior year comparable quarter.
Second quarter wind resource for the NEP portfolio was roughly 91% of the long-term average, which was similar to the prior year comparable period. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.
IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of holdco debt with the balance of the purchase price funded with cash on hand and through a draw under a project-level revolving credit facility. The use of holdco debt is consistent with our target at NEP for a long-term capital structure, utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million.
Looking ahead, NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities in financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015.
For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect the first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standard change on March 30, 2016, is expected to be largely representative of a full year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity.
At the corporate level, our base case planning continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed at the beginning of the quarter generating net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million. In addition, we continue to expect the opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long term contracted and rate regulated.
We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35, with more of our growth for a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter.
For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $260 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previously stated December 31, 2016, portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million. We are also updating the December 31, 2016, run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $760 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable on February 2017.
In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are off to a strong start through the first 2 quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one of the best in the industry and we are well positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the lines for questions."

I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for repowering. I'd say that anywhere from maybe 3 to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally, and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at has the permitting changed? Have the environmental regulations changed? What did the land leases look like? What discussions can we have with the customers? What did the old PPAs look like, if it's a merchant project? How comfortable are we with revenues and/or hedges that we have to take a look at? So we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects. But I can tell you that, in detail, at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with.

But a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense, it would be in '19 and '20. So a very small piece, and we're very happy to announce it today because it was certainly wasn't something that we were thinking about 6 months ago, but you'll probably continue to hear from us that, hey, this works, and this doesn't work and so on."

And then, just shifting over to natural gas infrastructure, you've had good success in growing the business. From here, when you look out at additional growth opportunities and natural gas infrastructure, are there logical growth opportunities that you really need in the near term? Or should we be thinking that while it's a great opportunity, it's going to be -- it's going to progress over an extended period of time? In other words, is there -- are there actionable additional options that you see? And do you also see sort of a real need in the near term? Or is this just something that's broader, it's not quite as near term in terms of your thinking around growth?"

So I think a couple of points on that. First, when we acquired the NET portfolio last year in Texas, one of the things that we said was we were happy to be acquiring an interstate portfolio of pipelines, and we thought it would give us opportunities to expand in that area, and that we believe that the additional gas requirements coming out of Mexico would present us opportunities down the line. We still think that. It's what moves our transactions that get negotiated with our friends south of the border always take a little bit longer than what we would expect, but we just still think that there are opportunities. I would -- I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities like we did in NET Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border, and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in, what I'll call, the acquisition market, which is primarily the MLP's participate in. So we're doing some greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream. And we are certainly hopeful that from now through 2020 that we would have another project, another pipeline project to be able to announce, but we -- I wouldn't say that there's anything in the near term that we would be announcing."

Although I can at least tell you on the returns that we wouldn't be making investment returns on repowering projects if they weren't at least as good as the returns that we're getting on new projects. But -- so we -- take a look at our portfolio, obviously, if a project does not have Production Tax Credits -- it is no longer generating Production Tax Credits, that makes it a pretty good candidate for repower. Why? Well, because if you're going to repower before the Production Tax Credits have expired, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits. Having said that, projects that still have 1 or 2 years of Production Tax Credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up 2 years old Production Tax Credits and getting another 10 years of Production Tax Credit, as an example, in 2020 when you can get 100% PTCs for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. Projects that what we call, the convertible investment tax credit, what other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had Production Tax Credits. Those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project financed, so either one of those would work. There's not a big difference, whether a project has already been dropped or sold to NextEra Energy Partners. Certainly, NextEra Energy Partners could do this. Projects that are merchant have one less difficulty associated with them. That is you don't have a PPA counterparty to have a discussion with. Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties, and they love the idea of repowering. I am not suggesting that those are going to get repowered, but at least the discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbines. So that's kind of the things -- probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine something -- somebody as a candidate."

And it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases, and you have a transmission interconnects, but there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects. So we have a big team on it. We're running through it. It's -- it is, as Armando said, if it's up to -- if it's as many as 3 or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us.

270586,374028299,1014508,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior y",3865,"Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter driven by new investments and Energy Resources. For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. NEP grew per unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of 2 high-quality wind facilities just after the end of the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we had previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund to customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to disallow investments in long-term natural gas supplies.
Aside from the impact of this decision, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results. We are on a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced the plan to acquire and phase out one of the state's highest greenhouse gas-emitting coal-fired plants located in Martin County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to enter service in mid-2019.
Earlier this month, FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power award for ranking highest in residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 score is our highest ever in the study's history. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the proceedings thus far in just a moment.
Energy Resources continued to benefit from strong contributions from new investments, and this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources, and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.
During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the wind PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction safe harbor of up to 4 years, increased from the 2-year safe harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact to timing of customer demand as a result of this increased tenure, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already considered to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history.
In addition, the IRS also provided guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects for roughly 327 megawatts that can be -- to be completed by the end of 2017.
We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables growth have never been stronger, and that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage, place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year drove substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis.
NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE technology. These high-quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnership's flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic as to future growth in 2016.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well positioned heading into the second half of the year.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior year comparable quarter but was offset by the impact of the Woodford Project Gas Reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers with regulatory capital employed growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year.
Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that closed in the third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown cogeneration facility is a 330-megawatt power plant located in Indiantown, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposes to purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017, and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers.
Along with Cedar Bay, this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of 2 of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader.
During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford Project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, and we appreciate the PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risk.
Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through future fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements accrued to date for this investment as compared to settled natural gas prices over the same period of time. Going forward, the Woodford Project investment has been removed from customer recovery, and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.
During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization, which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to Florida's economy. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was up approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs have been added since 2010. The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level, and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home price is up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remained near postrecession highs.
FPL's second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2% and increased weather-normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather-normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year as we saw last year.
As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, 9 quality of service hearings were conducted across the state, and an overwhelming majority of participants spoke positively about the service they received from FPL. Intervenor and staff testimony were filed earlier this month, and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September, and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments of long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement, and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share. A favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll-off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter.
Wind resources were roughly 92% of the long-term average, essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slides, including the impact of unfavorable market conditions on our upstream gas infrastructure activities and increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business.
As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced during the quarter by IS -- IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor provisions, the guidance extends the PTC for an additional 4-year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanying slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the safe harbor to precure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020 will qualify for 100% of the PTC. As compared to the 2-year safe harbor period that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increased tenure to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as to whether it may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years.
For solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on, given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the solar ITC phasedown is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are ultimately phased down.
In addition to the 4-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms 2 key points. First, it explains that the 5% safe harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80-20 rule, by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving forward with repowering 2 of our Texas wind assets. We are also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential size of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year.
Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowerings to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2018.
The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contracted renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015, and construction activities remain on track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year. From this base, the expectations we discussed in the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame are unchanged.
Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this time frame to approximately 575 megawatts.
Including 327-megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewables backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities.
While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remains subject to a number of uncertainties.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remains on track. FERC approval was received earlier this year, and we continue to expect that in-service date in mid-2017.
NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline project in which our expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process, and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million, and cash available for distributions was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter.
Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and CAFD roughly in line with the prior year comparable quarter.
Second quarter wind resource for the NEP portfolio was roughly 91% of the long-term average, which was similar to the prior year comparable period. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.
IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of holdco debt with the balance of the purchase price funded with cash on hand and through a draw under a project-level revolving credit facility. The use of holdco debt is consistent with our target at NEP for a long-term capital structure, utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million.
Looking ahead, NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities in financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015.
For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect the first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standard change on March 30, 2016, is expected to be largely representative of a full year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity.
At the corporate level, our base case planning continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed at the beginning of the quarter generating net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million. In addition, we continue to expect the opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long term contracted and rate regulated.
We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35, with more of our growth for a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter.
For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $260 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previously stated December 31, 2016, portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million. We are also updating the December 31, 2016, run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $760 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable on February 2017.
In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are off to a strong start through the first 2 quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one of the best in the industry and we are well positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the lines for questions."

I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for repowering. I'd say that anywhere from maybe 3 to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally, and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at has the permitting changed? Have the environmental regulations changed? What did the land leases look like? What discussions can we have with the customers? What did the old PPAs look like, if it's a merchant project? How comfortable are we with revenues and/or hedges that we have to take a look at? So we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects. But I can tell you that, in detail, at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with. And most of what we are seeing -- again, it's still very early because all these things are just like their own mini projects, most of what we're seeing we think would likely go COD in '19 and '20. There is obviously going to be a portion, if they work, that are going to be available in '17 and '18, and unfortunately, it's going to be probably be dribs and drabs like you have today when we announced these 327 megawatts. But a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense, it would be in '19 and '20. So a very small piece, and we're very happy to announce it today because it was certainly wasn't something that we were thinking about 6 months ago, but you'll probably continue to hear from us that, hey, this works, and this doesn't work and so on."

We still think that. It's what moves our transactions that get negotiated with our friends south of the border always take a little bit longer than what we would expect, but we just still think that there are opportunities. I would -- I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities like we did in NET Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border, and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in, what I'll call, the acquisition market, which is primarily the MLP's participate in. So we're doing some greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream.

Although I can at least tell you on the returns that we wouldn't be making investment returns on repowering projects if they weren't at least as good as the returns that we're getting on new projects. But -- so we -- take a look at our portfolio, obviously, if a project does not have Production Tax Credits -- it is no longer generating Production Tax Credits, that makes it a pretty good candidate for repower. Why? Well, because if you're going to repower before the Production Tax Credits have expired, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits. Having said that, projects that still have 1 or 2 years of Production Tax Credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up 2 years old Production Tax Credits and getting another 10 years of Production Tax Credit, as an example, in 2020 when you can get 100% PTCs for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. Projects that what we call, the convertible investment tax credit, what other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had Production Tax Credits. Those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project financed, so either one of those would work. There's not a big difference, whether a project has already been dropped or sold to NextEra Energy Partners. Certainly, NextEra Energy Partners could do this. Projects that are merchant have one less difficulty associated with them. That is you don't have a PPA counterparty to have a discussion with. Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties, and they love the idea of repowering. I am not suggesting that those are going to get repowered, but at least the discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbines. So that's kind of the things -- probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine something -- somebody as a candidate."

I mean, the reality is we have several gigawatts, as Armando said, of opportunities, but each project is a completely new development. And it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases, and you have a transmission interconnects, but there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects. So we have a big team on it. We're running through it. It's -- it is, as Armando said, if it's up to -- if it's as many as 3 or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us. And we're, as always, on something that we've been working. The other point I just wanted to make is we've been working on it for about 90 days.

Everybody knew that was going to occur. It was a question of how far. We've now identified because we now have the technology to identify how far some of that saltwater has migrated.

NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter driven by new investments and Energy Resources. For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. NEP grew per unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of 2 high-quality wind facilities just after the end of the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund to customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to disallow investments in long-term natural gas supplies.
Aside from the impact of this decision, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results. We are on a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced the plan to acquire and phase out one of the state's highest greenhouse gas-emitting coal-fired plants located in Martin County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to enter service in mid-2019.
Earlier this month, FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power award for ranking highest in residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 score is our highest ever in the study's history. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the proceedings thus far in just a moment.
Energy Resources continued to benefit from strong contributions from new investments, and this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources, and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.
During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the wind PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction safe harbor of up to 4 years, increased from the 2-year safe harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact to timing of customer demand as a result of this increased tenure, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already considered to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history.
In addition, the IRS also provided guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects for roughly 327 megawatts that can be -- to be completed by the end of 2017.
We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables growth have never been stronger, and that the capabilities of our development organization together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage, place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.
NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year drove substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis.
NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE technology. These high-quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnership's flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic as to future growth in 2016.
Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned heading into the second half of the year.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior year comparable quarter but was offset by the impact of the Woodford Project Gas Reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers with regulatory capital employed growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year.
Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that closed in the third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown cogeneration facility is a 330-megawatt power plant located in Indiantown, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposes to purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017, and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers.
Along with Cedar Bay, this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of 2 of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader.
During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford Project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, and we appreciate the PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risk.
Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through future fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements accrued to date for this investment as compared to settled natural gas prices over the same period of time. Going forward, the Woodford Project investment has been removed from customer recovery, and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.
During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to Florida's economy. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was up approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs have been added since 2010. The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level, and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home price is up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remained near postrecession highs.
FPL's second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2% and increased weather-normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather-normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year as we saw last year.
As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, 9 quality of service hearings were conducted across the state and an overwhelming majority of participants spoke positively about the service they received from FPL. Intervenor and staff testimony were filed earlier this month and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September, and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.
The 4-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments of long-term infrastructure and advanced technology which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement, and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share. A favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll-off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter.
Wind resources were roughly 92% of the long-term average, essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slides including the impact of unfavorable market conditions on our upstream gas infrastructure activities and increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business.
As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced during the quarter by IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor provisions, the guidance extends the PTC for an additional 4-year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanying slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the safe harbor to procure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020 will qualify for 100% of the PTC. As compared to the 2-year safe harbor period that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increased tenure to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as to whether it may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years.
For solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on, given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the solar ITC phasedown is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020.
Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are ultimately phased down.
In addition to the 4-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms 2 key points. First, it explains that the 5% safe harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80-20 rule, by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving forward with repowering 2 of our Texas wind assets. We are also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential size of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year.
Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowerings to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2018.
The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contracted renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015, and construction activities remain on track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year. From this base, the expectations we discussed in the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 time frame are unchanged.
Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this time frame to approximately 575 megawatts.
Including 327-megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewables backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities.
While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remains subject to a number of uncertainties.
Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remains on track. FERC approval was received earlier this year, and we continue to expect that in-service date in mid-2017.
NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline project in which our expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process, and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million, and cash available for distributions was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter.
Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and CAFD roughly in line with the prior year comparable quarter.
Second quarter wind resource for the NEP portfolio was roughly 91% of the long-term average, which was similar to the prior year comparable period. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense.
IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285-megawatt acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of holdco debt with the balance of the purchase price funded with cash on hand and through a draw under a project-level revolving credit facility. The use of holdco debt is consistent with our target at NEP for a long-term capital structure, utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service.
Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million.
Looking ahead, NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities in financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015.
For the first 6 months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect the first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standard change on March 30, 2016, is expected to be largely representative of a full year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity.
At the corporate level, our base case planning continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed at the beginning of the quarter generating net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million. In addition, we continue to expect the opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other nonstrategic assets in our portfolio. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long term contracted and rate regulated.
We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35, with more of our growth for a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter.
For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills wind energy centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $260 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previously stated December 31, 2016, portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million. We are also updating the December 31, 2016, run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $760 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable on February 2017.
In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are off to a strong start through the first 2 quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one of the best in the industry and we are well positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the lines for questions."

Obviously, a question that everybody wants to know, so they can give some size to the program. I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for repowering. I'd say that anywhere from maybe 3 to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally, and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at, has the permitting changed? Have the environmental regulations changed? What did the land leases look like? What discussions can we have with the customers? What did the old PPAs look like, if it's a merchant project? How comfortable are we with revenues and/or hedges that we have to take a look at? 
So we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects. But I can tell you that, in detail, at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with. And most of what we are seeing, again, it's still very early because all these things are just like their own mini projects, most of what we're seeing we think would likely go COD in '19 and '20. There is obviously going to be a portion, if they work, that are going to be available in '17 and '18, and unfortunately, it's going to be probably be dribs and drabs like you have today when we announced these 327 megawatts. But a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense, it would be in '19 and '20. So a very small piece, and we're very happy to announce it today because it was certainly wasn't something that we were thinking about 6 months ago, but you'll probably continue to hear from us that, hey, this works, and this doesn't work and so on."

So I think a couple of points on that. First, when we acquired the NET portfolio last year in Texas, one of the things that we said was we were happy to be acquiring an interstate portfolio of pipelines, and we thought it would give us opportunities to expand in that area, and that we believe that the additional gas requirements coming out of Mexico would present us opportunities down the line. We still think that. It's what moves or transactions that get negotiated with our friends south of the border always take a little bit longer than what we would expect, but we just still think that there are opportunities. I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities like we did in NET Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border, and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in the, what I'll call, the acquisition market which is primarily the MLP's participate in. So we're doing some greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream. And we are certainly hopeful that from now through 2020 that we would have another project, another pipeline project to be able to announce, but we -- I wouldn't say that there's anything in the near term that we would be announcing."

Although I can at least tell you on the returns that we wouldn't be making investment returns on repowering projects if they weren't at least as good as the returns that we're getting on new projects. But -- so we take a look at our portfolio, obviously, if a project does not have Production Tax Credits, it is no longer generating Production Tax Credits, that makes it a pretty good candidate for repower. Why? Well, because if you're going to repower before the Production Tax Credits have expired, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits. Having said that, projects that still have 1 or 2 years of Production Tax Credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up 2 years old Production Tax Credits and getting another 10 years of Production Tax Credit, as an example, in 2020 when you can get 100% PTCs for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. 
Projects that what we call, the convertible investment tax credit, what other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had Production Tax Credits. Those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project financed. So either one of those would work. There's not a big difference whether a project has already been dropped or sold to NextEra Energy Partners. Certainly, NextEra Energy Partners could do this. Projects that are merchant have one less difficulty associated with them. That is you don't have a PPA counterparty to have a discussion with. Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties, and they love the idea of repowering. I am not suggesting that those are going to get repowered, but at least the discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbines. So that's kind of the things, probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine something -- somebody as a candidate."

And it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases and you have a transmission interconnects, but there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects. So we have a big team on it. We're running through it. It's -- it is, as Armando said, if it's up to -- if it's as many as 3 or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us.

There is a concentration of saltwater below the cooling canals that has moved through the limestone. That was frankly anticipated during the original design of the canals. Everybody knew that was going to occur. It was a question of how far. We've now identified because we now have the technology to identify how far some of that saltwater has migrated. And we have a plan in place, working very closely with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Miami-Dade authorities and others to mitigate that plan. It's fact-based. It's science-based. We're going to undertake that. We're waiting on permits to be able to do some of that. And the cost associated with that is the cost associated with operating the plant.

Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's widespread destruction. 
Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid. Earlier this month, when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL's service territory along Florida's east coast, these investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration. In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which together with its grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000, including our own employees, along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period for our customers.
In addition, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced merger with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results.
Turning now to our financial performance. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2016. 
NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior year comparable period, primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Equally as importantly, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. 
At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus. Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case. And after months of negotiation, we are pleased to have reached with 3 intervenors what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement that will allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. A 1-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29. Our major capital initiatives progressed well. And we were pleased to receive commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates as well as FPL's solid financial performance during the third quarter in just a moment.
At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. And it was an excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, I am pleased report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects for post-2016 delivery to our backlog, including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resource's existing U.S. wind portfolio. We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set. And I will provide our latest thoughts on our expectations for repowering projects later in the call. 
Energy Resources' continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an approximately 132 megawatt share of high-quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy as it highlights the value of the Energy Resources' contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into development projects and enhances NextEra Energy's tax efficiency. 
NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in line with our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.34125 per common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier. Overall, with 3 strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the progress we are making at both NEE and NEP. 
Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million. And due to higher base revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million, coupled with our current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current allowed range. Based on what we see right now, we are likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which under the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next 4 years. 
Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330-megawatt coal-fired power plant that has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. With an expecting -- expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the facility for $451 million, including existing debt. Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million.
In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL's 374.5 megawatt utility-scale solar PV projects that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers. Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL's system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers.
Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective new solar generation approved over the 4-year term of 2017 through 2020. This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency improvements in solar technology that together make universal solar a cost-effective source of energy for our customers.
The Florida economy remains healthy. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national rate and Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since 2012. The latest readings of Florida's consumer sentiment have remained close to postrecession highs. 
FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period. And we estimate that approximately 3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between 0 and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future.
FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration cost is currently approximately $350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL's storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately $112 million in additional storm restoration costs. The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL's balance sheet. 
Under the 2012 rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration cost on an interim basis from customers through surcharges plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement. Interim recovery is available for costs that in total for the calendar year do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism.
As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidence to reprocess. And during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief in mid-September. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with 3 of the interveners in the proceeding: the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and the Florida Retail Federation. The 4-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue adjustments, as shown in the accompanying slide, and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources. The proposed agreement also includes the flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus any reserve amount remaining at the end of this year under FPL's 2012 rate agreement. 
As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments, or SoBRA, upon commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation, subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per kilowatt and a showing of overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under the SoBRA if approved by the commission. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills during the 12 months of cost recovery.
Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $400 million. The proposed agreement also authorizes the continuation with minor modification of the incentive mechanism for sharing with customers the gains that we achieved in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities and introduces a 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery storage pilot program until its next general base rate case. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which report a third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11 or approximately 22% from the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. Contributions from new investments to natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas pipeline acquisition last year. 
The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET Mexico Pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016, and if those expansion projects meet several preceding conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a nonbinding open season. While the results of that open system were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over the preceding agreements. However, based on the information we have to date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable. We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call as we move forward to sign agreements with the parties that have expressed interest in new capacity. The NET Mexico Pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the growing Mexican market from the U.S. We remain confident that the Texas pipeline assets, which is owned by NEP, will deliver on its suggested EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition. 
Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis, we would expect the $0.09 to be roughly $0.15 for the full year 2016. The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets earlier in the year, net of interest expense. Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of the long-term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. 
We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth, driven by the continued execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantages. As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced earlier this year by an IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the 4-year start-of-construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80-20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value.
Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today, we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts that could be completed in 2017/2018 time frame. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering projects. And earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar newbuild opportunities with significantly less capital investment. Based on everything we see now and inclusive of today's announcement and the announcement from our last call, we expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next 4 years with a greater portion of incremental opportunities expected to become actionable beyond 2018. 
In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I am also pleased to report continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018. The development activities for our natural gas pipelines remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC notice to proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments of Sabal Trail transmission and Florida Southeastern Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. 
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continued to expect approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. This NextEra Energy expected investment is approximately $1 billion. Let me now review the highlights for NEP.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million, respectively, and strong contributions from new assets remain the principal driver of growth from the prior year comparable period. In addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. 
As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million from the prior year comparable quarter. NEP has executed well against it's growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters at the time of the announcement, the full block of limited by ship units to be should in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading yield than the prior February offering and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we're able to access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance. In late September, the underwriters exercised the overall allotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million.
NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service. And based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $450 million to $500 million. Looking ahead, together with our aftermarket durable program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as the future growth opportunities and financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share, respectively.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other Segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced that it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million.
If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion. Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside a TTHC or Texas Transmission investment upon close of the merger.
We expect to fund the merger considerations for a combination of debt and equity consistent with our commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy's strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction further affirms NextEra energies commitment to Oncor in customers of the State of Texas. 
As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 a proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor electric delivery. The definitive agreement is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved EFHS entry into the merger agreement, and we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although there is inherent uncertainty involved the bankruptcy process, we currently expect to credit a vote and confirmation hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the end of the year. Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1 our joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition.
Based on our current targets for completing key milestones and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and all OMI would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor, are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings, enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of its previously announced 68% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018 off the 2014 base. 
Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make 2 already great companies even stronger. In addition, we expect that Oncor's credit rating will be improved post closing generating real savings for customers in terms of lower borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor's commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service and providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the continued economic growth of the state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the State of Texas and Oncor's customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy state and NextEra Energy's shareholders. 
Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year for at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.8.
For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well-positioned to achieve results for 2016 towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again, off our 2014 base of $5.30. We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at our investor conference this spring, following the resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distribution as DNA reasonable range of expectations through 2020 subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit winning the fourth quarter distribution net of payable in February 2017.
The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.
Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017.
The mid-point of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD mid-point based on our December 31, 2016 run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. 
In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results, and we are pleased with the progress we have made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. 
At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop down assets and NEP has excessentially debt capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth. 
Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our industry. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions."

Because if you have that, the current economics certainly work. There are -- you talked about Holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it's clear. I think we've made it clear that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017. We are slowly increasing the debt capacity of NextEra Energy Partners. So by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily, we believe that we would get to the whole coal capacity, which gives us in this market a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. 
I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra Energy Partners to really start talking about what we're going to do in the future with IDR's.

Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew.

Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's widespread destruction. 
Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid. Earlier this month, when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL's service territory along Florida's east coast, these investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration. In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which together with its grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000, including our own employees, along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period for our customers.
In addition, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced merger with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results.
Turning now to our financial performance. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2016. 
NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior year comparable period, primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Equally as importantly, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. 
At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus. Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case. And after months of negotiation, we are pleased to have reached with 3 intervenors what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement that will allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. A 1-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29. Our major capital initiatives progressed well. And we were pleased to receive commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates as well as FPL's solid financial performance during the third quarter in just a moment.
At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. And it was an excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, I am pleased report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects for post-2016 delivery to our backlog, including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resource's existing U.S. wind portfolio. We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set. And I will provide our latest thoughts on our expectations for repowering projects later in the call. 
Energy Resources' continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an approximately 132 megawatt share of high-quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy as it highlights the value of the Energy Resources' contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into development projects and enhances NextEra Energy's tax efficiency. 
NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in line with our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.34125 per common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier. Overall, with 3 strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the progress we are making at both NEE and NEP. 
Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million. And due to higher base revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million, coupled with our current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current allowed range. Based on what we see right now, we are likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which under the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next 4 years. 
Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330-megawatt coal-fired power plant that has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. With an expecting -- expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the facility for $451 million, including existing debt. Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million.
In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL's 374.5 megawatt utility-scale solar PV projects that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers. Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL's system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers.
Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective new solar generation approved over the 4-year term of 2017 through 2020. This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency improvements in solar technology that together make universal solar a cost-effective source of energy for our customers.
The Florida economy remains healthy. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national rate and Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since 2012. The latest readings of Florida's consumer sentiment have remained close to postrecession highs. 
FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period. And we estimate that approximately 3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between 0 and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future.
FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration cost is currently approximately $350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL's storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately $112 million in additional storm restoration costs. The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL's balance sheet. 
Under the 2012 rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration cost on an interim basis from customers through surcharges plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement. Interim recovery is available for costs that in total for the calendar year do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism.
As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidence to reprocess. And during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief in mid-September. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with 3 of the interveners in the proceeding: the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and the Florida Retail Federation. The 4-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue adjustments, as shown in the accompanying slide, and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources. The proposed agreement also includes the flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus any reserve amount remaining at the end of this year under FPL's 2012 rate agreement. 
As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments, or SoBRA, upon commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation, subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per kilowatt and a showing of overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under the SoBRA if approved by the commission. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills during the 12 months of cost recovery.
Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $400 million. The proposed agreement also authorizes the continuation with minor modification of the incentive mechanism for sharing with customers the gains that we achieved in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities and introduces a 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery storage pilot program until its next general base rate case. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which report a third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11 or approximately 22% from the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. Contributions from new investments to natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas pipeline acquisition last year. 
The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET Mexico Pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016, and if those expansion projects meet several preceding conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a nonbinding open season. While the results of that open system were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over the preceding agreements. However, based on the information we have to date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable. We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call as we move forward to sign agreements with the parties that have expressed interest in new capacity. The NET Mexico Pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the growing Mexican market from the U.S. We remain confident that the Texas pipeline assets, which is owned by NEP, will deliver on its suggested EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition. 
Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis, we would expect the $0.09 to be roughly $0.15 for the full year 2016. The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets earlier in the year, net of interest expense. Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of the long-term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. 
We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth, driven by the continued execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantages. As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced earlier this year by an IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the 4-year start-of-construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80-20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value.
Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today, we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts that could be completed in 2017/2018 time frame. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering projects. And earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar new build opportunities with significantly less capital investment. Based on everything we see now and inclusive of today's announcement and the announcement from our last call, we expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next 4 years with a greater portion of incremental opportunities expected to become actionable beyond 2018. 
In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I am also pleased to report continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018. The development activities for our natural gas pipelines remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC Notice to Proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeastern Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively. And FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continued to expect approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. This NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1 billion. 
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million, respectively. And strong contributions from new assets remain the principal driver of growth from the prior year comparable period. In addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million from the prior year comparable quarter. 
NEP has executed well against its growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters at the time of the announcement, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading yield than the prior February offering and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we're able to access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance. In late September, the underwriters exercised the overall allotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million.
NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service. And based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $450 million to $500 million. Looking ahead, together with our at-the-market dribble program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as the future growth opportunities and financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery, for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion. 
Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside at TTHC or Texas Transmission Investment upon close of the merger. We expect to fund the merger considerations through a combination of debt and equity consistent with our commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy's strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction further affirms NextEra Energy's commitment to Oncor, its customers and the state of Texas. As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 the proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor Electric Delivery. The definitive agreement is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved EFH's entry into the merger agreement. And we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although there is inherent uncertainty involved with the bankruptcy process, we currently expect a creditor vote and confirmation hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the end of the year. Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1 our joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and OMI, which would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor, are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings, enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of its previously announced 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018 off the 2014 base. 
Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make 2 already great companies even stronger. In addition, we expect that Oncor's credit rating will be improved post closing, generating real savings for customers in terms of lower borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor's commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service and providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the continued economic growth of the state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the state of Texas and Oncor's customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy estate and NextEra Energy's shareholders. 
Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year for at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.  For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve results for 2016 towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again off our 2014 base of $5.30. We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at an investor conference this spring, following the resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. 
The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD midpoint based on our December 31, 2016, run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. 
In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results, and we are pleased with the progress we have made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets. And NEP has excess debt capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our industry. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions."

On the holdco debt capacity, remember that we financed our July drop-down with largely debt. We did and went ahead and equitized the September drop.

That really was the main contribution to the additional holdco debt capacity to get us to $450 million to $550 million. In terms of the cushion on debt capacity, I really think that puts us in an opportunistic and flexible position as to how we time future drop-down opportunities and as to how we finance those opportunities. So we'll see how things progress in terms of the capital markets going forward, but that does give us flexibility. Also you've got to remember with wind assets, when we drop the wind assets in, you can think the leverage -- about the leverage from tax equity being right around 45% to 55%. So we're dropping those assets down, they're naturally creating additional holdco debt capacity at the NEP level."

Well, the IRS guidance allows you to do a whole bunch of work on those wind projects. And 80% of the value that you're putting in, if you meet the 80% test, the entire investment qualifies as new production tax credits. It's based on a fair value method though, not based a cost method. So when John answered the question before that it's a lot less capital for repowering opportunities and the economic returns are just as good or better, he was talking about the cost that was going into the wind project, not about the 80-20 test."

Because if you have that, the current economics certainly work. There are -- you talked about holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it's clear. I think we've made it clear that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017. We are slowly increasing the debt capacity of NextEra Energy Partners. So by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily, we believe that we would get to the holdco capacity, which gives us in this market a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra Energy Partners to really start talking about what we're going to do in the future with IDRs. We feel comfortable with the way NextEra Energy Partners is working right now. It brings a lot of benefits to NextEra Energy. We're certainly not comfortable with where it's trading.

Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew.

Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's widespread destruction. 
Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid. Earlier this month, when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL's service territory along Florida's east coast, these investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration. In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which together with its grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000, including our own employees, along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period for our customers.
In addition, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced merger with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results.
Turning now to our financial performance. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2016. 
NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior year comparable period, primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Equally as important, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. 
At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus. Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case. And after months of negotiation, we are pleased to have reached with 3 intervenors what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement that will allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. A 1-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29. Our major capital initiatives progressed well. And we were pleased to receive commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates as well as FPL's solid financial performance during the third quarter in just a moment.
At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. And it was an excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, I am pleased report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects for post-2016 delivery to our backlog, including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resource's existing U.S. wind portfolio. We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set. And I will provide our latest thoughts on our expectations for repowering projects later in the call. 
Energy Resources' continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an approximately 132 megawatt share of high-quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy as it highlights the value of the Energy Resources' contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into development projects and enhances NextEra Energy's tax efficiency. 
NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in line with our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.34125 per common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier. Overall, with 3 strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the progress we are making at both NEE and NEP. 
Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million. And due to higher base revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million, coupled with our current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current allowed range. Based on what we see right now, we are likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which under the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next 4 years. 
Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330-megawatt coal-fired power plant that has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. With an expecting -- expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the facility for $451 million, including existing debt. Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million.
In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL's 374.5 megawatt utility-scale solar PV projects that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers. Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL's system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers.
Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective new solar generation approved over the 4-year term of 2017 through 2020. This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency improvements in solar technology that together make universal solar a cost-effective source of energy for our customers.
The Florida economy remains healthy. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national rate and Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since 2012. The latest readings of Florida's consumer sentiment have remained close to postrecession highs. 
FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period. And we estimate that approximately 3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between 0 and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future.
FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration cost is currently approximately $350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL's storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately $112 million in additional storm restoration costs. The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL's balance sheet. 
Under the 2012 rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration cost on an interim basis from customers through surcharges plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement. Interim recovery is available for costs that in total for the calendar year do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism.
As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidentiary process. And during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief in mid-September. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with 3 of the interveners in the proceeding: the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and the Florida Retail Federation. The 4-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue adjustments, as shown in the accompanying slide, and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources. The proposed agreement also includes the flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus any reserve amount remaining at the end of this year under FPL's 2012 rate agreement. 
As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments, or SoBRA, upon commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation, subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per kilowatt and a showing of overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under the SoBRA if approved by the commission. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills during the 12 months of cost recovery.
Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $400 million. The proposed agreement also authorizes the continuation with minor modification of the incentive mechanism for sharing with customers the gains that we achieved in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities and introduces a 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery storage pilot program until its next general base rate case. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which report a third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11 or approximately 22% from the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. Contributions from new investments to natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas pipeline acquisition last year. 
The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET Mexico Pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016, and if those expansion projects meet several preceding conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a nonbinding open season. While the results of that open system were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over the preceding agreements. However, based on the information we have to date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable. We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call as we move forward to sign agreements with the parties that have expressed interest in new capacity. The NET Mexico Pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the growing Mexican market from the U.S. We remain confident that the Texas pipeline assets, which is owned by NEP, will deliver on its suggested EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition. 
Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis, we would expect the $0.09 to be roughly $0.15 for the full year 2016. The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets earlier in the year, net of interest expense. Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of the long-term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. 
We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth, driven by the continued execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantages. As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced earlier this year by an IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the 4-year start-of-construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80-20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value.
Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today, we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts that could be completed in 2017/2018 time frame. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering projects. And earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar new build opportunities with significantly less capital investment. Based on everything we see now and inclusive of today's announcement and the announcement from our last call, we expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next 4 years with a greater portion of incremental opportunities expected to become actionable beyond 2018. 
In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I am also pleased to report continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018. The development activities for our natural gas pipelines remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC Notice to Proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeastern Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively. And FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continued to expect approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. This NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1 billion. 
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million, respectively. And strong contributions from new assets remain the principal driver of growth from the prior year comparable period. In addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million from the prior year comparable quarter. 
NEP has executed well against its growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters at the time of the announcement, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading yield than the prior February offering and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we're able to access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance. In late September, the underwriters exercised the over allotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million.
NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service. And based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $450 million to $500 million. Looking ahead, together with our at-the-market dribble program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as the future growth opportunities and financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery, for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion. 
Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside at TTHC or Texas Transmission Investment upon close of the merger. We expect to fund the merger considerations through a combination of debt and equity consistent with our commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy's strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction further affirms NextEra Energy's commitment to Oncor, its customers and the state of Texas. As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 the proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor Electric Delivery. The definitive agreement is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved EFH's entry into the merger agreement. And we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although there is inherent uncertainty involved with the bankruptcy process, we currently expect a creditor vote and confirmation hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the end of the year. Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1 our joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and OMI, which would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor, are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings, enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of its previously announced 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018 off the 2014 base. 
Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make 2 already great companies even stronger. In addition, we expect that Oncor's credit rating will be improved post closing, generating real savings for customers in terms of lower borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor's commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service and providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the continued economic growth of the state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the state of Texas and Oncor's customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy estate and NextEra Energy's shareholders. 
Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year for at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.  For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve results for 2016 towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again off our 2014 base of $5.30. We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at an investor conference this spring, following the resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. 
The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD midpoint based on our December 31, 2016, run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. 
In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results, and we are pleased with the progress we have made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets. And NEP has excess debt capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our industry. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions."

On the holdco debt capacity, remember that we financed our July drop-down with largely debt. We then went ahead and equitized the September drop.

That really was the main contribution to the additional holdco debt capacity to get us to $450 million to $550 million. In terms of the cushion on debt capacity, I really think that puts us in an opportunistic and flexible position as to how we time future drop-down opportunities and as to how we finance those opportunities. So we'll see how things progress in terms of the capital markets going forward, but that does give us flexibility. Also you've got to remember with wind assets, when we drop the wind assets in, you can think the leverage -- about the leverage from tax equity being right around 45% to 55%.

Whether it's Tesla, as you mentioned, or whether it's other estimates that you and us have seen, I mean, battery storage will continue to come down significantly through this decade. And we continue to believe that at some point in the next decade, I don't know whether it will be earlier or whether it will be later, but battery storage will be commercially viable. The cost will come down enough that you'll be able to strap it with some -- with renewable technology, whether it's wind or more likely solar and have a very competitive project in the renewable energy space."

Because if you have that, the current economics certainly work. There are -- you talked about holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it's clear. I think we've made it clear that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017. We are slowly increasing the debt capacity of NextEra Energy Partners. So by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily, we believe that we would get to the holdco debt capacity, which gives us in this market a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra Energy Partners to really start talking about what we're going to do in the future with IDRs.

Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew.

Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's widespread destruction. 
Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid. Earlier this month, when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL's service territory along Florida's east coast, these investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration. In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which together with its grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000, including our own employees, along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period for our customers.
In addition, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced merger with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results.
Turning now to our financial performance. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2016. 
NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior year comparable period, primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Equally as important, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. 
At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus. Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case. And after months of negotiation, we are pleased to have reached with 3 intervenors what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement that will allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. A 1-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29. Our major capital initiatives progressed well. And we were pleased to receive commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates as well as FPL's solid financial performance during the third quarter in just a moment.
At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. And it was an excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, I am pleased report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects for post-2016 delivery to our backlog, including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resource's existing U.S. wind portfolio. We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set. And I will provide our latest thoughts on our expectations for repowering projects later in the call. 
Energy Resources' continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an approximately 132 megawatt share of high-quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy as it highlights the value of the Energy Resources' contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into development projects and enhances NextEra Energy's tax efficiency. 
NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in line with our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.34125 per common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier. Overall, with 3 strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the progress we are making at both NEE and NEP. 
Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. 
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million. And due to higher base revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million, coupled with our current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current allowed range. Based on what we see right now, we are likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which under the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next 4 years. 
Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330-megawatt coal-fired power plant that has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. With an expecting -- expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the facility for $451 million, including existing debt. Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million.
In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL's 374.5 megawatt utility-scale solar PV projects that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers. Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL's system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers.
Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective new solar generation approved over the 4-year term of 2017 through 2020. This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency improvements in solar technology that together make universal solar a cost-effective source of energy for our customers.
The Florida economy remains healthy. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national rate and Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since 2012. The latest readings of Florida's consumer sentiment have remained close to postrecession highs. 
FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period. And we estimate that approximately 3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between 0 and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future.
FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration cost is currently approximately $350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL's storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately $112 million in additional storm restoration costs. The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL's balance sheet. 
Under the 2012 rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration cost on an interim basis from customers through surcharges plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement. Interim recovery is available for costs that in total for the calendar year do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism.
As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidentiary process. And during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief in mid-September. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with 3 of the interveners in the proceeding: the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and the Florida Retail Federation. The 4-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue adjustments, as shown in the accompanying slide, and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources. The proposed agreement also includes the flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus any reserve amount remaining at the end of this year under FPL's 2012 rate agreement. 
As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments, or SoBRA, upon commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation, subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per kilowatt and a showing of overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under the SoBRA if approved by the commission. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills during the 12 months of cost recovery.
Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $400 million. The proposed agreement also authorizes the continuation with minor modification of the incentive mechanism for sharing with customers the gains that we achieved in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities and introduces a 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery storage pilot program until its next general base rate case. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which report a third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11 or approximately 22% from the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. Contributions from new investments to natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas pipeline acquisition last year. 
The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET Mexico Pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016, and if those expansion projects meet several preceding conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a nonbinding open season. While the results of that open system were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over the preceding agreements. However, based on the information we have to date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable. We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call as we move forward to sign agreements with the parties that have expressed interest in new capacity. The NET Mexico Pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the growing Mexican market from the U.S. We remain confident that the Texas pipeline assets, which is owned by NEP, will deliver on its suggested EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition. 
Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis, we would expect the $0.09 to be roughly $0.15 for the full year 2016. The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets earlier in the year, net of interest expense. Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of the long-term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense, reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. 
We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth, driven by the continued execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantages. As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a 5-year phasedown period was further enhanced earlier this year by an IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the 4-year start-of-construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80-20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new 10-year PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine's total value.
Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at 2 of our existing Texas wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today, we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts that could be completed in 2017/2018 time frame. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering projects. And earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar new build opportunities with significantly less capital investment. Based on everything we see now and inclusive of today's announcement and the announcement from our last call, we expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next 4 years with a greater portion of incremental opportunities expected to become actionable beyond 2018. 
In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I am also pleased to report continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018. The development activities for our natural gas pipelines remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC Notice to Proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeastern Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively. And FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continued to expect approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. This NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1 billion. 
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million, respectively. And strong contributions from new assets remain the principal driver of growth from the prior year comparable period. In addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million from the prior year comparable quarter. 
NEP has executed well against its growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters at the time of the announcement, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading yield than the prior February offering and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we're able to access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance. In late September, the underwriters exercised the overallotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million.
NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5x project distributions after project debt service. And based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $450 million to $500 million. Looking ahead, together with our at-the-market dribble program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as the future growth opportunities and financing activities.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today, NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC's approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery, for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy's previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion. 
Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside at TTHC or Texas Transmission Investment upon close of the merger. We expect to fund the merger considerations through a combination of debt and equity consistent with our commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy's strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction further affirms NextEra Energy's commitment to Oncor, its customers and the state of Texas. As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 the proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor Electric Delivery. The definitive agreement is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved EFH's entry into the merger agreement. And we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although there is inherent uncertainty involved with the bankruptcy process, we currently expect a creditor vote and confirmation hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the end of the year. Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1 our joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and OMI, which would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor, are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings, enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of its previously announced 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018 off the 2014 base. 
Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make 2 already great companies even stronger. In addition, we expect that Oncor's credit rating will be improved post closing, generating real savings for customers in terms of lower borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor's commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service and providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the continued economic growth of the state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the state of Texas and Oncor's customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy estate and NextEra Energy's shareholders. 
Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year for at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.  For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve results for 2016 towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again off our 2014 base of $5.30. We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at an investor conference this spring, following the resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. 
The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD midpoint based on our December 31, 2016, run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. 
In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results, and we are pleased with the progress we have made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets. And NEP has excess debt capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our industry. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions."

On the holdco debt capacity, remember that we financed our July drop-down with largely debt. We then went ahead and equitized the September drop.

That really was the main contribution to the additional holdco debt capacity to get us to $450 million to $550 million. In terms of the cushion on debt capacity, I really think that puts us in an opportunistic and flexible position as to how we time future drop-down opportunities and as to how we finance those opportunities. So we'll see how things progress in terms of the capital markets going forward, but that does give us flexibility. Also you've got to remember with wind assets, when we drop the wind assets in, you can think the leverage -- about the leverage from tax equity being right around 45% to 55%.

So that's what the due from related parties is. On the battery question, I'll defer it to Armando."

And we keep saying that we would expect batteries to be a significant investment opportunity for us some time earlier in the next decade. And it's tracking based on where we thought our expectations would be. We have roughly, currently, well, I'm going to say about 10 projects, 10 battery projects across the U.S. and Canada, all -- a little bit different technology in each one. But these are fairly small investments that we're making in battery storage. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 million to $15 million is a potential average for each one of those investments. Whether it's Tesla, as you mentioned, or whether it's other estimates that you and us have seen, I mean, battery storage will continue to come down significantly through this decade. And we continue to believe that at some point in the next decade, I don't know whether it will be earlier or whether it will be later, but battery storage will be commercially viable. The cost will come down enough that you'll be able to strap it with some -- with renewable technology, whether it's wind or more likely solar and have a very competitive project in the renewable energy space."

The way that the 80-20 works is obviously, for others on the phone, if you were to go out and completely tear down a wind project and start over, you'd get PTCs on the new investment. Well, the IRS guidance allows you to do a whole bunch of work on those wind projects. And 80% of the value that you're putting in, if you meet the 80% test, the entire investment qualifies as new production tax credits. It's based on a fair value method though, not based a cost method. So when John answered the question before that it's a lot less capital for repowering opportunities and the economic returns are just as good or better, he was talking about the cost that was going into the wind project, not about the 80-20 test."

So when John mentioned that our expectation that this could be a $2 billion to $2.5 billion program, virtually all of the remaining opportunities that we are looking at are under power purchase agreements. And therefore, we would have to have discussions with the counterparty, as John mentioned earlier, to make sure that we can move forward on those. I feel comfortable that we would move forward on a vast majority of those. And that's why we gave CapEx guidance on the total program today."

So I understand that you have the corporate debt capacity you can use to finance growth. But as you -- you're the only one really with active IDRs among the yieldcos and those IDRs require simply more and more assets to be dropped down in order to meet this 12% to 15% growth in distributions per share for LP holders, and as such, basically, your funding requirements are growing quite considerably as you multiply spreads [ph]. Would you consider, for instance, doing away with the IDR, so in case there's no recovering the liquidity in the yieldco market on the equity side? Or do you feel like between cofinancing via NextEra or a private placement, you can actually place enough equity to achieve the growth and pay IDRs?"

I mean, what's the pipeline at the sponsor to be able to drop down projects? Do you have a long pipeline of opportunities to be able to drop down into, in this case, NextEra Energy Partners. Because if you have that, the current economics certainly work. There are -- you talked about holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it's clear. I think we've made it clear that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017. We are slowly increasing the debt capacity of NextEra Energy Partners. So by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily, we believe that we would get to the holdco debt capacity, which gives us in this market a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra Energy Partners to really start talking about what we're going to do in the future with IDRs. We feel comfortable with the way NextEra Energy Partners is working right now. It brings a lot of benefits to NextEra Energy. We're certainly not comfortable with where it's trading. I don't think any management team is ever comfortable with where their units are trading. But we feel confident that we at NextEra Energy will be able to have a sufficient number of projects for a sufficient number of time in order for NextEra Energy Partners to be successful long term."
