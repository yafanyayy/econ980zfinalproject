We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high-end of our initial guidance driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chip",1127,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high-end of our initial guidance driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chipset shipments were near the high-end of expectations with low tier strength across OEMs, particularly in China, offsetting some weakness in thin modem sales and the key customer. QTL revenues were higher than expectations on stronger 3G/4G device volumes and ASPs, and we continue to make progress in signing up Chinese licensees although there are still more work to be done on that front. 
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases, which included the completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced last March. This $10 billion is over and above our commitment to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our stockholders. 
We are also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint venture with TDK to enable the delivery of RF front end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT applications. Once closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging and modular integration technologies to our RF 360 portfolio to offer leading-edge RF solutions in fully integrated systems that we believe will provide significant advantages in performance and time to launch across our Snapdragon product tiers. The deal is expected to close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in its first year. We have a strong pipeline of new RF front end products, including new generations of our envelope tracker, antenna tuner, switches and CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs. Our gas PAs are anticipated to enter production in 2017. In addition, we continue to deepen our level of cooperation with and investment in China. We just announced a cooperation agreement with the province of Joe, including the formation of a joint venture that will design, develop and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. This builds on the announcement we made in October detailing the availability of our server development platform, which is now sampling to Tier 1 cloud customers and the strategic partnerships we have established with and. We continue to make good progress on the elements of our Strategic Realignment Plan and are on track to achieve our cost savings targets. 
I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the Board. Jeff brings extensive financial and operational management experience to his position as an Independent Director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health and past automotive industry experience. Following our Annual Meeting in March, assuming our slate of directors are elected, our board size will be reduced to 12 members and the average tenure will be reduced to approximately 5 years. I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to President of QCT. He provided exceptional leadership over his 18 years at Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expanding QCT's road map, enhancing our customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in our adjacent opportunities and positioning the business for long-term success. 
On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design traction of our Snapdragon 820 processor. The first product announcement based on the 820 occurred at CES and we expect a number of exciting launches in the first half of this calendar year, including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100 design wins the based on the 820 and the product is entering mass production using 14-nanometer LBP technology. 
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many industries are looking to leverage mobile technology into their products and businesses are looking to the leaders in communications and compute systems, such as Qualcomm, to make the world more connected and smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our progress extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, including automotive, IoT and networking. In auto, we announced the Qualcomm Snapdragon 602A [ph] processors will be commercially available in 2017 Audi vehicles. We've also introduced our next-generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor as well as several other products, including our wireless charging technology. For IoT, we announced a smart home reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor; the new QUALCOMM active HD solution for high resolution audio over Bluetooth; a new Bluetooth smart SoC; the first commercial drone based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight platform and the Snapdragon X59X07 [ph] LTE modem, which broadens our family of modem solutions for IoT. In networking, we launched Qualcomm WiFi sans, which is a self-organizing network solution to simplify WiFi networking and optimize user experience, and we showed significant traction in multi-brand WiFi, 802.11ac and 11ad enabling products across multiple segments. As we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the industry in the development of a unified, more capable 5G platform that will take on a much larger role than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The foundation of this platform is an OFDM-based unified air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. 5G will also include native support for advanced technologies such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, multi-cast and device-to-device capabilities. We are pioneering these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and accelerating our path to a truly connected future. 
Overall, we are pleased with our progress on key initiatives, execution of the Strategic Realignment Plan, design traction for the Snapdragon 820, refreshing the QCT roadmap across tiers, broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, progress on new licensing agreements in China, execution of our data center strategy and advancements that will extend our technology leadership position. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on execution to improve our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year. Our industry and company are undergoing rapid changes and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We are extending our leadership in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in communications systems and high-performance low-power computing into significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to seize these opportunities while delivering improved performance. I'm optimistic about the future and have great confidence in our employees to execute on our strategies and drive growth. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day, and would now like to turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309328954,921799,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently c",676,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in China. QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectations and would have been even higher if not for a contract dispute with LG that resulted in us deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter. Although LG continues to report and pay, we are not recognizing revenue while the arbitration regarding the dispute proceeds. We believe LG's claims are without merit. The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it as their shipments are included in total reported device sales without the corresponding revenue. Assuming we conclude this matter successfully as we have done with others in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that time. 
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device shipment continues to be strong. With respect to smartphones in particular, there continues to be a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular connections globally and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2019 according to GSMA intelligence and Gartner. Calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments are largely in line with our prior expectations driven primarily by migrations to 4G in China, partially offset by some recent weakness in developer regions. We continue to estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments will grow approximately 10% at the midpoint driven primarily by the migration to 3G/4G devices in emerging regions with particular strength in India. Our estimate for premium tier shipments is down slightly versus our prior view driven by slower-than-expected sellthrough at our large OEM. But that is offset by slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016 as unit growth more than offset ASP declines. We will provide further color on our long-term outlook for the 3G/4G device opportunity at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. We are continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreements on the NDRC terms with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. We are making progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, T2 [ph] and Tianyu. These agreements include royalty bearing licenses for 3-mode devices and contain terms that are consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the NDRC. Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful of key Chinese OEMs, and those negotiations continue. Our progress and our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government continue to give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs. While we are working to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations and audits, we are prepared to enforce our agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith underreporting royalties or refusing to conclude agreements in the near term. 
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect QTL's revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion. Although additional risk has been introduced as a result of the new LG dispute given that it could be resolved outside of fiscal 2016. In conclusion, although we are seeing some near-term softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain healthy and should continue to grow. We remain confident that we'll be able to resolve the dispute with LG, conclude new agreements with remaining key Chinese OEMs and improve compliance over time. 
That concludes my comments and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over to George."
33493,309328954,921799,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect the strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings pe",896,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect the strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above the midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected stronger revenues in our licensing business and accelerated cost reductions in QCT. We also benefited at the end of the quarter from the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit impacting non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.01 to $0.02. In QTL, higher-than-expected ASPs and shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the dispute impact in the quarter. Total reported device sales includes some reported devices without the corresponding revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described as well as some deferred 3-mode revenues. QCT shipped 242 million MSMs with revenues of $4.1 billion and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger-than-expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset by lower-than-expected shipments of thin modems. For the company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations decreasing approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives originally forecasted to be taken later in the fiscal year. 
Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion or 47% of revenue for the quarter and we returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17% in the fiscal first quarter and we now estimate that our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our previous estimate of 19% to 20%. 
Now turning to fiscal 2016. For QTL, we are not modifying the prior $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion range -- revenue range for the year. However, that range did not anticipate deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we are working hard to resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is possible that the resolution will not occur in fiscal 2016. In this case, the deferral of the LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several hundred million dollars. In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of the fiscal year on new product traction. We also continue to expect to achieve a QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the Strategic Realignment Plan and now expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion. We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, down an additional 1% at the midpoint on earlier capture of cost savings related to previous estimates. 
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our outlook reflects a seasonally strong December quarter for 3G/4G device shipments for QTL and a seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of potential revenue from signing new license agreements in China and we have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1 per share. We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our SRP initiatives. In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the dispute related units continue to be reported and the matter is not resolved during the quarter, then we could again see units included in for which revenue would not be recognized. Also in QTL, we're expecting a onetime benefit of approximately $250 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter based on termination of an infrastructure license agreement that resulted from one of our licensees acquiring another one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear amortization of approximately $100 million in quarterly license fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance. In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units, lower sequentially reflecting seasonal trends, somewhat exaggerated by an above seasonal decline in demand for thin modem products. We also see some modest negative impact from mixed shift across OEMs and devices in China. We expect revenue per MSM to be higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments, and consistent with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-single digits. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

This is really a contract dispute under their agreement similar to a number of the ones we've had in the past, which we've resolved successfully for the company and we feel very firmly that we're going to be able to do that again here. And so they'll be a question of timing. We decided for now not to adjust the QTL revenue guidance for the year because we still have 3 quarters left to resolve it and we think there's a chance that, that can happen. If it goes all the way through the arbitration process, that will likely push it outside the fiscal year. But we feel very good in our position and again, we've been through a number of these in the past and they've worked out well."

Second question I have is very strong in Q1 and I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about what's going on under since the mix we shifted toward the lower end.

The underlying sort of underreporting by licensees agreements, I would say, is kind of marginally been in line over the last couple of quarters. It's not materially improving or worsening.

It grew very nicely last 2 years ago and it's beginning to slow down. Now I'm just curious as to why the deal now. What do you see out there that gives you that this is in the right time to invest more aggressively in this market?"

We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial guidance, driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chi",1125,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial guidance, driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chipset shipments were near the high end of expectations with low tier strength across OEMs, particularly in China, offsetting some weakness in thin modem sales at a key customer. QTL revenues were higher than expectations on stronger 3G/4G device volumes and ASPs, and we continue to make progress in signing up Chinese licensees, although there are still more work to be done on that front.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases, which included the completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced last March. This $10 billion is over and above our commitment to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our stockholders.
We are also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint venture with TDK to enable the delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT applications. Once closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging and module integration technologies to our RF360 portfolio to offer leading-edge RF solutions in fully integrated systems that we believe will provide significant advantages in performance and time to launch across our Snapdragon product tiers. The deal is expected to close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in its first year. We have a strong pipeline of new RF front-end products, including new generations of our envelope tracker, antenna tuner, switches and CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs. Our GaAs PAs are anticipated to enter production in 2017.
In addition, we continue to deepen our level of cooperation with and investment in China. We just announced a cooperation agreement with the Province of Guizhou, including the formation of a joint venture that will design, develop and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. This builds on the announcement we made in October detailing the availability of our server development platform, which is now sampling to tier-1 cloud customers and the strategic partnerships we have established with Xilinx and Mellanox.
We continue to make good progress on the elements of our Strategic Realignment Plan and are on track to achieve our cost savings targets. 
I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the Board. Jeff brings extensive financial and operational management experience to his position as an Independent Director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health, and past automotive industry experience. Following our Annual Meeting in March, assuming our slate of directors are elected, our board size will be reduced to 12 members, and the average tenure will be reduced to approximately 5 years.
I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to President of QCT. He provided exceptional leadership over his 18 years at Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expanding QCT's road map, enhancing our customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in our adjacent opportunities and positioning the business for long-term success.
On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design traction of our Snapdragon 820 processor. The first product announcement based on the 820 occurred at CES, and we expect a number of exciting launches in the first half of this calendar year, including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100 design wins based on the 820, and the product is entering mass production using 14-nanometer LPP technology. 
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many industries are looking to leverage mobile technology into their products, and businesses are looking to the leaders in communications and compute systems, such as Qualcomm, to make the world more connected and smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our progress extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, including automotive, IoT and networking.
In auto, we announced that Qualcomm Snapdragon 602a processors will be commercially available in 2017 Audi vehicles. We also introduced our next-generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor as well as several other products, including our wireless charging technology. For IoT, we announced a smart home reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor; the new Qualcomm apTX HD solution for high-resolution audio over Bluetooth; a new Bluetooth smart SoC; the first commercial drone based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight platform; and the Snapdragon X5 9x07 LTE modem, which broadens our family of modem solutions for IoT.
In networking, we launched Qualcomm Wi-Fi SON, which is a self-organizing network solution to simplify WiFi networking and optimize user experience; and we showed significant traction in multi-band WiFi, 802.11ac and 11ad, enabling products across multiple segments.
As we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the industry in the development of a unified, more capable 5G platform that will take on a much larger role than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The foundation of this platform is an OFDM-based unified air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. 5G will also include native support for advanced technologies, such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, multi-cast and device-to-device capabilities. We are pioneering these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and accelerating our path to a truly connected future.
Overall, we are pleased with our progress on key initiatives, execution of the Strategic Realignment Plan, design traction for the Snapdragon 820, refreshing the QCT road map across tiers, broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, progress on new licensing agreements in China, execution of our data center strategy and advancements that will extend our technology leadership position. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on execution to improve our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year. Our industry and company are undergoing rapid changes, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We are extending our leadership in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in communications systems and high-performance, low-power computing into significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to seize these opportunities while delivering improved performance. I'm optimistic about the future and have great confidence in our employees to execute on our strategies and drive growth.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day and would now like to turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309328954,921914,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently c",675,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in China. QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectations and would have been even higher if not for a contract dispute with LG that resulted in us deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter. Although LG continues to report and pay, we are not recognizing revenue while the arbitration regarding the dispute proceeds. We believe LG's claims are without merit. The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it, as their shipments are included in total reported device sales without the corresponding revenue. Assuming we conclude this matter successfully, as we have done with others in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that time.
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device shipments continues to be strong. With respect to smartphones in particular, there continues to be a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular connections globally, and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2019 according to GSMA Intelligence and Gartner. Calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments are largely in line with our prior expectations, driven primarily by migrations to 4G in China, partially offset by some recent weakness in developed regions. We continue to estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments will grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, driven primarily by the migration to 3G/4G devices in emerging regions, with particular strength in India.
Our estimate for premium-tier shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected sell-through at a large OEM. But that is offset by a slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016 as unit growth more than offsets ASP declines. We will provide further color on our long-term outlook for the 3G/4G device opportunity at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. We are continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreements on the NDRC terms with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. We are making progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, Qiku and Tianyu. These agreements include royalty-bearing licenses for 3-mode devices and contain terms that are consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the NDRC.
Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful of key Chinese OEMs, and those negotiations continue. Our progress and our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government continue to give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs. While we are working to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations and audits, we are prepared to enforce our agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith, underreporting royalties or refusing to conclude agreements in the near term.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect QTL's revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion, although additional risk has been introduced as a result of the new LG dispute given that it could be resolved outside of fiscal 2016.
In conclusion, although we are seeing some near-term softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain healthy and should continue to grow. We remain confident that we'll be able to resolve the dispute with LG, conclude new agreements with the remaining key Chinese OEMs and improve compliance over time.
That concludes my comments, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over to George."

Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per",895,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above the midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected stronger revenues in our licensing business and accelerated cost reductions in QCT. We also benefited at the end of the quarter from the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, impacting non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.01 to $0.02.
In QTL, higher-than-expected ASPs and shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the dispute impact in the quarter. Total reported device sales includes some reported devices without the corresponding revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described as well as some deferred 3-mode revenues. QCT shipped 242 million MSMs, with revenues of $4.1 billion and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger-than-expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset by lower-than-expected shipments of thin modems.
For the company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations, decreasing approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives originally forecasted to be taken later in the fiscal year.
Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion or 47% of revenue for the quarter, and we returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17% in the fiscal first quarter. And we now estimate that our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our previous estimate of 19% to 20%.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. For QTL, we are not modifying the prior $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion range -- revenue range for the year. However, that range did not anticipate deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we are working hard to resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is possible that the resolution will not occur in fiscal 2016. In this case, the deferral of the LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several hundred million dollars.
In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of the fiscal year on new product traction. We also continue to expect to achieve a QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the Strategic Realignment Plan and now expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion.
We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, down an additional 1% at the midpoint on earlier capture of cost savings relative to previous estimates.
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our outlook reflects a seasonally strong December quarter for 3G/4G device shipments for QTL and a seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of potential revenue from signing new license agreements in China, and we have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1 per share.
We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our SRP initiatives.
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the dispute-related units continue to be reported and the matter is not resolved during the quarter, then we could again see units included in TRDS for which revenue would not be recognized. Also in QTL, we're expecting a onetime benefit of approximately $250 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter based on termination of an infrastructure license agreement that resulted from one of our licensees acquiring another one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear amortization of approximately $100 million in quarterly license fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance.
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units, lower sequentially, reflecting seasonal trends, somewhat exaggerated by an above-seasonal decline in demand for thin modem products. We also see some modest negative impact from mix shift across OEMs and devices in China. We expect revenue per MSM to be higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments. And consistent with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-single digits.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

And I think as you go into the second half of '16, we'll probably start seeing, as a percentage of units in China, a reduction in the amount of 3-mode on a go-forward basis."

And so as we conclude new agreements with those companies, you'll see a meaningful improvement in sort of the run rate collection because they also tend to be some of the larger 3-mode players in China. So you'll capture the 3-mode, plus you'll get them back reporting on the non-3-mode, which will leave you, really, with this compliance question, which will still be something we need to work through.

So on lower revenue, OpEx as a percent of revenue is obviously going to weigh on the margin.

Another thing to think about QCT in the second half is we're seeing increased design traction across all tiers, not only the 820, in particular in China, because of the acceleration of LTE Advanced, which is 4G plus and the all-mode that was mentioned by Derek earlier."

We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial guidance, driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chipset shipments were near the high end of expectations with low-tier strength across OEMs, particularly in China, offsetting some weakness in thin modem sales at a key customer. QTL revenues were higher than expectations on stronger 3G/4G device volumes and ASPs, and we continue to make progress in signing up Chinese licensees, although there are still more work to be done on that front.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases, which included the completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced last March. This $10 billion is over and above our commitment to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our stockholders.
We are also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint venture with TDK to enable the delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT applications. Once closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging and module integration technologies to our RF360 portfolio to offer leading-edge RF solutions in fully integrated systems that we believe will provide significant advantages in performance and time to launch across our Snapdragon product tiers. The deal is expected to close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in its first year. We have a strong pipeline of new RF front-end products, including new generations of our envelope tracker, antenna tuner, switches and CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs. Our GaAs PAs are anticipated to enter production in 2017.
In addition, we continue to deepen our level of cooperation with and investment in China. We just announced a cooperation agreement with the Province of Guizhou, including the formation of a joint venture that will design, develop and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. This builds on the announcement we made in October detailing the availability of our server development platform, which is now sampling to tier-1 cloud customers and the strategic partnerships we have established with Xilinx and Mellanox.
We continue to make good progress on the elements of our Strategic Realignment Plan and are on track to achieve our cost savings targets. 
I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the board. Jeff brings extensive financial and operational management experience to his position as an Independent Director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health and past automotive industry experience. Following our Annual Meeting in March, assuming our slate of directors are elected, our board size will be reduced to 12 members, and the average tenure will be reduced to approximately 5 years.
I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to President of QCT. He provided exceptional leadership over his 18 years at Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expanding QCT's road map, enhancing our customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in our adjacent opportunities and positioning the business for long-term success.
On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design traction of our Snapdragon 820 processor. The first product announcement based on the 820 occurred at CES, and we expect a number of exciting launches in the first half of this calendar year, including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100 design wins based on the 820, and the product is entering mass production using 14-nanometer LPP technology. 
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many industries are looking to leverage mobile technology into their products, and businesses are looking to the leaders in communications and compute systems, such as Qualcomm, to make the world more connected and smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our progress extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, including automotive, IoT and networking.
In auto, we announced that Qualcomm Snapdragon 602a processors will be commercially available in 2017 Audi vehicles. We also introduced our next-generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor as well as several other products, including our wireless charging technology. For IoT, we announced a smart home reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor; the new Qualcomm apTX HD solution for high-resolution audio over Bluetooth; a new Bluetooth smart SoC; the first commercial drone based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight platform; and the Snapdragon X5 9x07 LTE modem, which broadens our family of modem solutions for IoT.
In networking, we launched Qualcomm Wi-Fi SON, which is a self-organizing network solution, to simplify WiFi networking and optimize user experience; and we showed significant traction in multi-band WiFi, 802.11ac and 11ad, enabling products across multiple segments.
As we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the industry in the development of a unified, more capable 5G platform that will take on a much larger role than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The foundation of this platform is an OFDM-based unified air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. 5G will also include native support for advanced technologies, such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, multi-cast and device-to-device capabilities. We are pioneering these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and accelerating our path to a truly connected future.
Overall, we are pleased with our progress on key initiatives, execution of the Strategic Realignment Plan, design traction for the Snapdragon 820, refreshing the QCT road map across tiers, broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, progress on new licensing agreements in China, execution of our data center strategy, and advancements that will extend our technology leadership position. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on execution to improve our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year. Our industry and company are undergoing rapid changes, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We are extending our leadership in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in communications systems and high-performance, low-power computing into significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to seize these opportunities while delivering improved performance. I'm optimistic about the future and have great confidence in our employees to execute on our strategies and drive growth.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day and would now like to turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309328954,921937,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently c",675,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in China. QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectations and would have been even higher if not for a contract dispute with LG that resulted in us deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter. Although LG continues to report and pay, we are not recognizing revenue while the arbitration regarding the dispute proceeds. We believe LG's claims are without merit. The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it, as their shipments are included in total reported device sales without the corresponding revenue. Assuming we conclude this matter successfully, as we have done with others in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that time.
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device shipments continues to be strong. With respect to smartphones in particular, there continues to be a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular connections globally, and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2019 according to GSMA Intelligence and Gartner. Calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments are largely in line with our prior expectations, driven primarily by migrations to 4G in China, partially offset by some recent weakness in developed regions. We continue to estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments will grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, driven primarily by the migration to 3G/4G devices in emerging regions, with particular strength in India.
Our estimate for premium-tier shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected sell-through at a large OEM. But that is offset by a slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016 as unit growth more than offsets ASP declines. We will provide further color on our long-term outlook for the 3G/4G device opportunity at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. We are continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreements on the NDRC terms with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. We are making progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, Qiku and Tianyu. These agreements include royalty-bearing licenses for 3-mode devices and contain terms that are consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the NDRC.
Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful of key Chinese OEMs, and those negotiations continue. Our progress and our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government continue to give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs. While we are working to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations and audits, we are prepared to enforce our agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith, underreporting royalties or refusing to conclude agreements in the near term.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect QTL's revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion, although additional risk has been introduced as a result of the new LG dispute given that it could be resolved outside of fiscal 2016.
In conclusion, although we are seeing some near-term softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain healthy and should continue to grow. We remain confident that we'll be able to resolve the dispute with LG, conclude new agreements with the remaining key Chinese OEMs, and improve compliance over time.
That concludes my comments, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over to George."
33493,309328954,921937,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per",895,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above the midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected stronger revenues in our licensing business and accelerated cost reductions in QCT. We also benefited at the end of the quarter from the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, impacting non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.01 to $0.02.
In QTL, higher-than-expected ASPs and shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the dispute impact in the quarter. Total reported device sales includes some reported devices without the corresponding revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described, as well as some deferred 3-mode revenues. QCT shipped 242 million MSMs, with revenues of $4.1 billion and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger-than-expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset by lower-than-expected shipments of thin modems.
For the company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations, decreasing approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives originally forecasted to be taken later in the fiscal year.
Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion or 47% of revenue for the quarter, and we returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17% in the fiscal first quarter. And we now estimate that our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our previous estimate of 19% to 20%.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. For QTL, we are not modifying the prior $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion range -- revenue range for the year. However, that range did not anticipate deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we are working hard to resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is possible that the resolution will not occur in fiscal 2016. In this case, the deferral of the LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several hundred million dollars.
In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of the fiscal year on new product traction. We also continue to expect to achieve a QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the Strategic Realignment Plan and now expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion.
We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, down an additional 1% at the midpoint on earlier capture of cost savings relative to previous estimates.
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our outlook reflects a seasonally strong December quarter for 3G/4G device shipments for QTL and a seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of potential revenue from signing new license agreements in China, and we have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1 per share.
We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our SRP initiatives.
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the dispute-related units continue to be reported and the matter is not resolved during the quarter, then we could again see units included in TRDS for which revenue would not be recognized. Also in QTL, we're expecting a onetime benefit of approximately $250 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter based on termination of an infrastructure license agreement that resulted from one of our licensees acquiring another one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear amortization of approximately $100 million in quarterly license fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance.
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units, lower sequentially, reflecting seasonal trends, somewhat exaggerated by an above-seasonal decline in demand for thin modem products. We also see some modest negative impact from mix shift across OEMs and devices in China. We expect revenue per MSM to be higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments. And consistent with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-single digits.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

Although, actually, what we're seeing in the market in China is more of a shift to 5- and 6-mode devices and away from 3-mode devices. And so a lot of the design traction now has moved. And I think as you go into the second half of '16, we'll probably start seeing, as a percentage of units in China, a reduction in the amount of 3-mode on a go-forward basis."

And then the unit numbers, the paid units were pretty good, above what we've seen as normal seasonality.

That revenue, we expect, will come in, in future quarters. So that's also having a drag. So you've got sort of the disputed TRDS as well as this 3-mode element that is kind of collectively putting some pressure on the rate. There is -- there are catch-up units in the quarter. I would say that they're not a huge contributor, but they're probably less than about 20 million units for the quarter."

And I would have thought at some point, the increase in compliance in China will drive an uptick to the QTL revenue profile. It doesn't seem to be doing that, even if I take out the impact of LG this year. So how should we think about the future compliance with more vendors you want to sign up? Should that QTL revenue ramp-up [ph] reflecting that? Or are there other factors at work that we should think about this year?"

And then the third thing that we talked about last quarter were actually a small number of companies but actually meaningful in size that had actually started withholding reports and payment of licensed non-3-mode units. And so as we conclude new agreements with those companies, you'll see a meaningful improvement in sort of the run rate collection because they also tend to be some of the larger 3-mode players in China. So you'll capture the 3-mode, plus you'll get them back reporting on the non-3-mode, which will leave you, really, with this compliance question, which will still be something we need to work through. But those 2 -- I think it's really a relatively small number of companies that need to get signed, and you'll see a pretty material improvement in the run rate in QTL."

The underlying sort of underreporting by licensees that have agreements, I would say, has kind of largely been in line over the last couple of quarters. It's not materially improving or worsening.

So on lower revenue, OpEx as a percent of revenue is obviously going to weigh on the margin. And then, of course, you just have the natural gross margin impact when you see a big seasonal adjustment in units, and that's really what we're seeing. So nothing more than that.

Question number 2 is about the implications of 820 in the second half of the year. Can you discuss the implications on margins and the implications on ASPs? I think the ASPs are quite straightforward. But the question is when you start ramping 820, does it have positive implications on margins right from the beginning? Or to the contrary, it has negative implications at first until you ramp to a certain level or you expense certain expenses and only then it goes up?"

We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial guidance, driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chi",1125,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial guidance, driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chipset shipments were near the high end of expectations with low-tier strength across OEMs, particularly in China, offsetting some weakness in thin modem sales at a key customer. QTL revenues were higher than expectations on stronger 3G/4G device volumes and ASPs, and we continue to make progress in signing up Chinese licensees, although there are still more work to be done on that front.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases, which included the completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced last March. This $10 billion is over and above our commitment to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our stockholders.
We are also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint venture with TDK to enable the delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT applications. Once closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging and module integration technologies to our RF360 portfolio to offer leading-edge RF solutions in fully integrated systems that we believe will provide significant advantages in performance and time to launch across our Snapdragon product tiers. The deal is expected to close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in its first year. We have a strong pipeline of new RF front-end products, including new generations of our envelope tracker, antenna tuner, switches and CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs. Our GaAs PAs are anticipated to enter production in 2017.
In addition, we continue to deepen our level of cooperation with and investment in China. We just announced a cooperation agreement with the Province of Guizhou, including the formation of a joint venture that will design, develop and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. This builds on the announcement we made in October detailing the availability of our server development platform, which is now sampling to Tier 1 cloud customers and the strategic partnerships we have established with Xilinx and Mellanox.
We continue to make good progress on the elements of our Strategic Realignment Plan and are on track to achieve our cost savings targets. 
I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the board. Jeff brings extensive financial and operational management experience to his position as an Independent Director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health and past automotive industry experience. Following our Annual Meeting in March, assuming our slate of directors are elected, our board size will be reduced to 12 members, and the average tenure will be reduced to approximately 5 years.
I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to President of QCT. He provided exceptional leadership over his 18 years at Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expanding QCT's road map, enhancing our customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in our adjacent opportunities and positioning the business for long-term success.
On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design traction of our Snapdragon 820 processor. The first product announcement based on the 820 occurred at CES, and we expect a number of exciting launches in the first half of this calendar year, including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100 design wins based on the 820, and the product is entering mass production using 14-nanometer LPP technology. 
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many industries are looking to leverage mobile technology into their products, and businesses are looking to the leaders in communications and compute systems, such as Qualcomm, to make the world more connected and smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our progress extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, including automotive, IoT and networking.
In auto, we announced that Qualcomm Snapdragon 602a processors will be commercially available in 2017 Audi vehicles. We also introduced our next-generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor as well as several other products, including our wireless charging technology. For IoT, we announced a smart home reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor; the new Qualcomm apTX HD solution for high-resolution audio over Bluetooth; a new Bluetooth smart SoC; the first commercial drone based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight platform; and the Snapdragon X5 9x07 LTE modem, which broadens our family of modem solutions for IoT.
In networking, we launched Qualcomm Wi-Fi SON, which is a self-organizing network solution, to simplify WiFi networking and optimize user experience; and we showed significant traction in multi-band WiFi, 802.11ac and 11ad, enabling products across multiple segments.
As we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the industry in the development of a unified, more capable 5G platform that will take on a much larger role than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The foundation of this platform is an OFDM-based unified air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. 5G will also include native support for advanced technologies, such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, multi-cast and device-to-device capabilities. We are pioneering these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and accelerating our path to a truly connected future.
Overall, we are pleased with our progress on key initiatives, execution of the Strategic Realignment Plan, design traction for the Snapdragon 820, refreshing the QCT road map across tiers, broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, progress on new licensing agreements in China, execution of our data center strategy and advancements that will extend our technology leadership position. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on execution to improve our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year. 
Our industry and company are undergoing rapid changes, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We are extending our leadership in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in communications systems and high-performance, low-power computing into significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to seize these opportunities while delivering improved performance. I'm optimistic about the future and have great confidence in our employees to execute on our strategies and drive growth.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day and would now like to turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309328954,959696,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently c",675,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units as well as some catch-up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in China. 
QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectations and would have been even higher if not for a contract dispute with LG that resulted in us deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter. Although LG continues to report and pay, we are not recognizing revenue while the arbitration regarding the dispute proceeds. 
We believe LG's claims are without merit. The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it, as their shipments are included in total reported device sales without the corresponding revenue. Assuming we conclude this matter successfully, as we have done with others in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that time.
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device shipments continues to be strong. With respect to smartphones in particular, there continues to be a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular connections globally, and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2019 according to GSMA Intelligence and Gartner. 
Calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments are largely in line with our prior expectations, driven primarily by migrations to 4G in China, partially offset by some recent weakness in developed regions. We continue to estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments will grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, driven primarily by the migration to 3G/4G devices in emerging regions, with particular strength in India.
Our estimate for premium-tier shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected sell-through at a large OEM. But that is offset by a slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016 as unit growth more than offsets ASP declines. We will provide further color on our long-term outlook for the 3G/4G device opportunity at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. We are continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreements on the NDRC terms with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. We are making progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, Qiku and Tianyu. These agreements include royalty-bearing licenses for 3-mode devices and contain terms that are consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the NDRC.
Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful of key Chinese OEMs, and those negotiations continue. Our progress and our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government continue to give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs. While we are working to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations and audits, we are prepared to enforce our agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith, underreporting royalties or refusing to conclude agreements in the near term.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect QTL's revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion, although additional risk has been introduced as a result of the new LG dispute given that it could be resolved outside of fiscal 2016.
In conclusion, although we are seeing some near-term softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain healthy and should continue to grow. We remain confident that we'll be able to resolve the dispute with LG, conclude new agreements with the remaining key Chinese OEMs, and improve compliance over time.
That concludes my comments, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over to George."
33493,309328954,959696,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per",895,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above the midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected stronger revenues in our licensing business and accelerated cost reductions in QCT. We also benefited at the end of the quarter from the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, impacting non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.01 to $0.02.
In QTL, higher-than-expected ASPs and shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the dispute impact in the quarter. Total reported device sales includes some reported devices without the corresponding revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described, as well as some deferred 3-mode revenues. QCT shipped 242 million MSMs, with revenues of $4.1 billion and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger-than-expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset by lower-than-expected shipments of thin modems.
For the company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations, decreasing approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives originally forecasted to be taken later in the fiscal year.
Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion or 47% of revenue for the quarter, and we returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17% in the fiscal first quarter. And we now estimate that our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our previous estimate of 19% to 20%.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. For QTL, we are not modifying the prior $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion range -- revenue range for the year. However, that range did not anticipate deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we are working hard to resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is possible that the resolution will not occur in fiscal 2016. In this case, the deferral of the LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several hundred million dollars.
In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of the fiscal year on new product traction. We also continue to expect to achieve a QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the Strategic Realignment Plan and now expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion.
We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, down an additional 1% at the midpoint on earlier capture of cost savings relative to previous estimates.
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our outlook reflects a seasonally strong December quarter for 3G/4G device shipments for QTL and a seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of potential revenue from signing new license agreements in China, and we have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1 per share.
We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our SRP initiatives.
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the dispute-related units continue to be reported and the matter is not resolved during the quarter, then we could again see units included in TRDS for which revenue would not be recognized. 
Also in QTL, we're expecting a onetime benefit of approximately $250 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter based on termination of an infrastructure license agreement that resulted from one of our licensees acquiring another one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear amortization of approximately $100 million in quarterly license fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance.
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units, lower sequentially, reflecting seasonal trends, somewhat exaggerated by an above-seasonal decline in demand for thin modem products. We also see some modest negative impact from mix shift across OEMs and devices in China. We expect revenue per MSM to be higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments. And consistent with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-single digits.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

Although, actually, what we're seeing in the market in China is more of a shift to 5- and 6-mode devices and away from 3-mode devices. And so a lot of the design traction now has moved.

And so as we conclude new agreements with those companies, you'll see a meaningful improvement in sort of the run rate collection because they also tend to be some of the larger 3-mode players in China. So you'll capture the 3-mode, plus you'll get them back reporting on the non-3-mode, which will leave you, really, with this compliance question, which will still be something we need to work through. But those 2 -- I think it's really a relatively small number of companies that need to get signed, and you'll see a pretty material improvement in the run rate in QTL."

We decided for now not to adjust the QTL revenue guidance for the year because we still have 3 quarters left to resolve it, and we think there's a chance that, that can happen. If it goes all the way through the arbitration process, that will likely push it outside the fiscal year. But we feel very good in our position. And again, we've been through a number of these in the past and they've worked out well."

In terms of more color on some of the regulatory issues that we're dealing with, not much more color we can add, other than to say our licensing model, as you know, has been in effect for quite a few decades. It's been modeled after others. Everybody in the industry follows the device-level licensing, for example. And we're very confident in the chances of trying to convince regulators that this model has not only been effective, but has enhanced competition. We've -- through our licensing model of sharing our intellectual property, I think we have broadened the field. And our immense investment in research and development and the core technologies, which we patent and then share, I think has contributed to the growth of this industry.

And we have our estimates, but it'd be nice to get some kind of indication from you guys. And then I also wanted to talk a little bit about QCT margins again. I guess, 2 questions within that. One is can you give us some idea what the fixed cost level there is? And should we be looking at fiscal Q1, fiscal Q2 and that margin move as some indication of where that number is? Second question I had is those margins are pretty strong in Q1, and I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about what's going on underlying that. Since the mix was shifted toward the low end, I would have thought that would drag margins down, but they were actually quite strong. So could you just comment on that?"

For '16, it's really going to be dependent, I think, highly on the timing of getting these additional agreements signed. The underlying sort of underreporting by licensees that have agreements, I would say, has kind of largely been in line over the last couple of quarters. It's not materially improving or worsening. It's really been more the dynamic of the people that have withheld payment and reporting, which will get resolved upon signing the agreements.

On Q1, I think one of the things that you saw was better performance by QCT, particularly on OpEx pulling in some of the cost savings earlier into the year, which actually helped that margin and improved that margin relative to our expectations going into the quarter. I would say that some of that has narrowed. In terms of the OpEx improvement quarter-over-quarter, you're not getting quite the move. So on lower revenue, OpEx as a percent of revenue is obviously going to weigh on the margin. And then, of course, you just have the natural gross margin impact when you see a big seasonal adjustment in units, and that's really what we're seeing. So nothing more than that.

But sort of on balance, we expected it to be down modestly for the year. So I would say if you adjust it for the impact of the disputed revenue and the reported sales in the quarter that didn't have revenue coming along with it because of the catch-up units, we would be broadly sort of in line with that. You are correct that once this amortization of the $100 million expires, that will come out. We've talked about the fact that we have license fees, and those are amortized over a period of time.

We delivered a stronger than expected quarter as we continue to execute on our strategies to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth.

We delivered a stronger than expected quarter as we continue to execute on our strategies to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high-end of our guidance range, driven by strength in both QTL and QCT. QTL revenue reflects seasonally strong December quarter activity, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in China. We signed several new China licenses in the first few months with more than 100 companies now having accepted the NDRC terms. We remain in active discussions with a few key Chinese OEMs that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress in those discussions. 
We are also pleased to have recently resolved our licensing dispute with LG. In QCT, our chipset shipments were above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, earned by strong demand from Chinese OEMs and we had favorable product costs. During the quarter, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth. We remain focused on improving our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year, and we are on track in this regard. 
In QCT, we have updated our road map across tiers and our new products that have been very well-received in. The flagship Snapdragon 820 is now available in leading devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5 and the Xiaomi Me 5, along with devices from Sony, HTC, HP and others. We now have over 115 Snapdragon 820 designs and expect volume to ramp on this platform through the second half of the fiscal year. 
Our strategy of offering differentiated all modem solutions with carrier aggregation capability is extending our leadership and enabling strong design traction, particularly in China at the mid and high tiers. In China, new use cases for carrier aggregation are providing product differentiators for our customers and enhancing our design traction. We are continuing to pursue additional content opportunities in the smartphone and recently announced a suite of next-generation Qualcomm RF360 technology. 
We are on track to deliver our next-generation CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs in 2017 and we extend our product offerings including complete RF front-end module solution once the TDK transaction closes. Further, we are broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. Collectively, the serviceable addressable opportunity for these and adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from $12 billion to $29 billion, according to a combination of third-party and internal estimate and we are well positioned to benefit from this expanding opportunity. 
We expect these adjacent opportunities to drive a approximately $2.5 billion in QCT revenue in fiscal year 2016. We are seeing significant momentum across these areas. In automotive, we have very strong design traction in telematics across Tier 1 manufacturers. With the completion of our CSR acquisition, we now have a comprehensive connectivity portfolio, including Bluetooth smart, WiFi and LTE, which allows us to offer a broader suite of products to our expanded set of customers. 
It networking, we had a strong pipeline up over 240 designs with our 802.11ac solutions across router, home Gateway and set-top box implementation. We continue to gain significant traction and win category-defining designs in IoT segments, such as wearables, action cameras, security and surveillance cameras, virtual reality head sets, drones and smart city infrastructure. At NWC, we announced ecosystem expansion for our next-generation Snapdragon ware platform, and we are pleased to report that there are now over 100 wearable devices using Qualcomm technology, which includes over 80% of all Android wear, smartwatch designs. 
Looking at the IoT more broadly, there are now over 1 billion IoT devices that have shipped using Qualcomm technology. We continue to forecast QCT operating margins of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter and are targeting 20% plus operating margins longer term. It is important to note that for planning purposes, both our near-term and long-term margin targets have consistently factored in a range of second sourcing assumptions at our large customers and we believe our margin targets are achievable under those scenarios. 
We have a strong confidence in our technology leadership, differentiated modem road map and unique global scale. For instance, we recently demonstrated our Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the first commercially announced gigabit class LTE chipset, designed to deliver fiber-like LTE category 16 download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, at least 2 generations ahead of the competition. This modem also supports licensed assisted access standard for LTE in unlicensed spectrum, becoming the mobile industry's first commercially announced LTE Advanced Pro modem and marks an important step towards 5G as we enable deeper, unlicensed spectrum integration with LTE and more advanced my mode techniques to support growing data consumption. 
Further, we are leading the world to 5G as we did in both 3G and 4G. To support this, we are designing a new OFDM-based 5G interface that will not only enhanced mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. We've demonstrated our 5G millimeter wave, 28 gigahertz prototype system at Mobile World Congress showcasing robust and sustainable broadband communications at these higher spectrum bands. 
Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic plans to position us well for the future. Fiscal 2016 is a transition year, and we are making very good progress. We are taking decisive steps to enable us to capitalize on significant opportunities ahead while delivering improving near-term performance. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek."
33493,309328989,960192,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a stronger-than-expected fiscal second quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $70 billion, reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter.

As Steve noted, QTL had a stronger-than-expected fiscal second quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $70 billion, reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter. I'm pleased to report that we recently resolved our dispute with LG. As a result of the resolution, we will resume recognizing quarterly LG revenues in fiscal Q3. In addition to recording the revenues, we deferred from the first 2 fiscal quarters. As a reminder, LG continued to report and pay during the dispute so the sales they reported for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 were included in the total reported device sales for those quarters, but we did not recognize revenues for those quarters given that the arbitration was underway. 
We are also continuing to make steady progress in China, completing new China license agreements. We recently signed new agreements with Lenovo, EW PE, Yulong and High Sense and now have more than 100 companies that have accepted the NDRC terms, including the top 5 worldwide Chinese licensees. Yulong and High Sense were signed after the close of our second fiscal quarter and will be reflected in our third quarter results. In addition, we're still actively negotiating with several of their other remaining key Chinese OEMs and are making progress in those discussions. As we explained at our Analyst Day in February, we're also working hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance with our licensees in China. We have begun implementing those plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. 
The percentage of global units not reported to us during the second fiscal quarter increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by share gains from OEMs that have been withholding royalties during license negotiations. Looking ahead, we continue to see growth in global 3G/4G device shipments. LTE penetration is only approximately 16% of cellular connections globally and cumulative smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.7 billion from 2016 through 2020 according to GSM intelligence and Gartner. For calendar year 2015, we now estimate global 3G/4G device shipments were approximately 1.55 billion units, slightly below the midpoint of our prior range and up approximately 13% year-over-year. 
We saw strong growth in emerging regions, particularly in China and expect this trend to continue in calendar 2016. We were adjusting our estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments to 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint, down from our previous midpoint estimate of approximately 10% growth. The strong 4G ramp in China continues as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings and design momentum is moving rapidly towards all mode devices across China. 
The strength in China however is being offset by a reduction in growth rates and other emerging regions, which we believe is attributable to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, our forecast for premium tier device shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected upgrades with -- within one of the premium tier ecosystems. Global 3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking slightly better than our prior expectations of an approximately 6% year-over-year decline for the fiscal year, driven primarily by stronger premium tier ASPs. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016 as unit growth is expected to more than offset ASP decline. Despite adjustments to near-term ship shipment estimates we believe the long-term growth drivers for 3G/4G device sales remain intact and provide a solid foundation for the licensing business to deliver greater than $10 billion in revenue in our fiscal 2020. 
Turning to offer a QTL revenue outlook for fiscal 2016. Despite weaker-than-expected unit shipments for the fiscal year, we continue to expect QTL revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Given the weaker-than-expected 3G/4G device demand, we will need to make some additional progress on signing the remaining license agreements in China in order to be within that range, but continued to feel that is achievable. As we said at our Analyst Day, although there will be quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide, we estimate a normalized rate for fiscal 2016 will be approximately 2.9%. This is based on adjusting for one-time items and other anomalies such as indifference in timing between when revenues for catch-up payments are recognized and when the related TRDS may be reported. 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China and are pleased to have resolved the LG dispute. We are keenly focused on concluding the right long-term agreements with the remaining China licensees as well as improving compliance and expect continued progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year. That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call over to George."

Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP revenues were $5.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.04, up 7% sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance range. In QCT, MSM shipments were $189 million, 2% above the midpoint of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger demand in China. QCT revenues were $3.3 billion with a sequentially higher implied revenue per MSM. QCT operating margin was 5% for the high end of our prior expectations. 
In QTL, total reported device sales and revenues benefited from strength in both developed and emerging regions during the holiday quarter. As a reminder, we report QTL on a quarter lag so these results reflect the strength of the fourth calendar quarter holiday demand. QTL results also include a one-time revenue benefit of $266 million, resulting from the merger of 2 infrastructure licensees as we forecasted on last quarter's call. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear license fee amortization of approximately $100 million per quarter as well as the impact of the LG dispute revenue deferral, which will now be included in our fiscal third quarter results, consistent with the settlement announced today. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses decreased 1% sequentially, slightly less than our guidance range due to an increase in legal and litigation related expenses. We returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases at an average price of approximately $49 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $30 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 18%, consistent with our expected rate for the full year. 
Now turning to fiscal 2016. In QTL, as Derek indicated, we continue to forecast revenues will be between $7.3 billion to $8 billion, despite the weaker overall TRDS outlook for the year. In QCT, we continue to see improving demand for premium and high tier devices in the second half of the fiscal year, offset by reduced demand for thin modem products and low tier chipsets. We remain on track for operating margin of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under the Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016, relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. The summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisitions of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas will be down 7% to 9% year-over-year. Turning to our fiscal third quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.2 billion to $6 billion, up approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint, driven by a strong product mix in QCT and a favorable LG dispute resolution in QTL, including catch-up revenues from prior period activity. 
We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be approximately $0.90 to $1 per share, down approximately 4% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be approximately flat sequentially. In QTL, fiscal third quarter revenue will include recognition of more than $200 million that was deferred in the first fiscal in second [ph] quarters related to the LG dispute resolution. 
Separately, we estimate total reported device sales between $52 billion and $62 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments. We have not included any potential benefit from license agreements under negotiation, consistent with our prior practice. We expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be down sequentially, in line with seasonal trends reflecting the first calendar quarter. 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units during the June quarter and we expect revenue from some to be up more than 10% sequentially. We expect QCT operating margins improve sequentially and being in the range of 9% to 10% for the fiscal third quarter. These expectations reflect the benefit of a stronger chip road map on both performance and cost leadership across tiers, favorable product mix, growth in adjacent opportunities and lower operating expenses. 
That concludes my comments and we'll now turn the call back to Warren."

Obviously, the LG issue from last quarter created some confusion. We said that was really outside the range. Now that, that has been resolved, what we're saying is that the end market is softer than we had anticipated when we set the range upfront, and that's pulled down the overall size of the market. So we would have to make up some of that in the form of some additional progress on the licensing agreements and we feel that we're making progress there so it would be premature to say that we don't believe that we'll end up somewhere in between the $7.3 billion and $8 billion that we started with."

With most of the company, it would really be along the lines of action to enforce their agreement that they have in place today. And like I said, we've been preparing for quite some time to do that if necessary. But so far, have felt like were still making enough progress with the licensees and I think the progress that you're seeing through the announcements is in support of that. And so we're going to keep at it and see if we can get across the finish line without the need for litigation, but of course, it's always an option for us if we need it."

And so when we send them to the new NDRC terms, it doesn't -- that doesn't result in most cases, any significant catch-up on the non-3 mode part of the market. As you noted though, in many cases, it will result in them starting to pay royalties and pay past royalties on 3-mode devices that were previously not licensed. It's turned out so far that a number of the players have been the smaller players in the 3 mode market and so the contributions from that haven't been significant or we've -- the way we structure the deals in how the past royalties have been structured to be paid over time, those are things that will come into our P&L through probably a period of time later in '16 and then maybe even to '17. And so we are getting agreements for those to be paid. It's just their being probably spread over a longer time than people anticipate. There are less than a handful of the companies that we're in negotiations with that are larger players also on 3 mode and non-3 mode that have not been reporting while they're negotiating.

China continues to be quite strong and overall, also the ASP pictures looking good as well. We expected moderation in the ASP declines year-over-year and that seems to be at least so far tracking better than our assumption. So we do feel like there is the net-net of that is a bit weaker market for the fiscal year, but we gave a pretty wide range on QTL revenue for the year just given all the different elements in there and we felt with still some time left in the year, we do believe we can continue to make progress in China as we have been demonstrating over the last few months. And so as George mentioned, just felt it was premature to adjust the range. We will need to make more progress relative to where we were before, just given the change in the market, but we still think the range is a reasonable range to hold now.

And so I think we'll stick with this process, but we have said for the full year in the $.3 billion to $8 billion that we will have to conclude some activity on the licensing front to get back within that range because of the softness in the market."

But if I look at the -- if I look at -- I think about things at the high level, China was not in past quarter outside of the, a payment Huawei this year, this quarter, you do have China and you also have LG in. So why are we seeing -- we don't need much higher contribution of China, just on a like-for-like basis. Again, the TRDS between the 2 quarters is down 7.5%, but revenue is down 11.6%. So you're down more than the TRDS that's, given to China is kicking in this year. So I'm just trying to understand the dynamics of China's contribution and why is it a much stronger take or much stronger revenue than we are seeing right now."

So as George said, that is not in Q2 that will be reflected in Q3, both the in quarter activity for Q3 as well as 2 quarters, 2 prior quarters of catch-up. In terms of trying to look -- do the walk between last year Q2 to this year in Q2, George hit on some of that. Obviously, we've got kind of a onetime event in Q2 this quarter with the acceleration of the licensee that came in, the $266 million-ish payment, but then being offset by the fact that LG revenues are deferred, they're not in the quarter. And then we also have the end of this $100 million-ish, the quarter amortization, that's reflected in this quarter. Plus as you mentioned a year ago, we had some catch-up payments about $150 million from the resolution of a prior dispute. And then the China contribution, China was reflected pretty strongly in the year-ago quarter, meaning that was the last quarter that was reported to us before the NDRC resolution, the effect of that took hold in January of 2015. And so one of the other issues you're dealing with the year-over-year comparison is you've got the application of the NDRC terms now in this quarter. That wasn't a factor a year ago as well as we saw the amount of units that are being underreported accelerate throughout the year last year, in particular related to these negotiations where licensee stopped paying, and that was not really a primary driver in the year-ago quarter. So I think that's kind of the walk is probably the best we can break it out."

We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter, as we continued to execute on our strategies to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high-end of our guidance range, driven by strength in both QTL and QCT. QTL revenues reflect seasonally strong December quarter activity, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in China. We signed several new China licenses in the first few months with more than 100 companies now having accepted the NDRC terms. We remain in active discussions with the few key Chinese OEMs that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress in those discussion.
We are also pleased to have recently resolved our licensing dispute with LG. In QCT, our chipset shipments were above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, driven by strong demand from Chinese OEMs, and we had favorable product costs.
 During the quarter, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth. We remain focused on improving our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year, and we are on track in this regard. 
In QCT, we have updated our road map across tiers, and our new products have been very well received. The flagship Snapdragon 820 is now available in leading devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5 and the Xiaomi Me 5, along with devices from Sony, HTC, HP and others. We now have over 115 Snapdragon 820 designs and expect volume to ramp on this platform through the second half of the fiscal year. 
Our strategy of offering differentiated all-mode modem solutions with carrier aggregation capability is extending our leadership and enabling strong design traction, particularly in China at the mid and high tiers. In China, new use cases for carrier aggregation are providing product differentiators for our customers and enhancing our design traction. We are continuing to pursue additional content opportunities in the smartphone and recently announced a suite of next-generation Qualcomm RF360 technology. 
We are on track to deliver our next-generation CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs in 2017, and will extend our product offerings including complete RF front-end module solution once the TDK transaction closes. 
Further, we are broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. Collectively, the serviceable addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from $12 billion to $29 billion, according to a combination of third-party and internal estimate. And we are well positioned to benefit from this expanding opportunity. 
We expect these adjacent opportunities to drive approximately $2.5 billion in QCT revenues in fiscal year 2016. We are seeing significant momentum across these areas. In automotive, we have very strong design traction in telematics across Tier 1 manufacturers. With the completion of our CSR acquisition, we now have a comprehensive connectivity portfolio, including Bluetooth smart, WiFi and LTE, which allows us to offer a broader suite of products to our expanded set of customers. 
In networking, we have a strong pipeline of over 240 designs with our 802.11ac solutions across router, home gateway and set-top box implementation. We continue to gain significant traction and win category-defining designs in IoT segments, such as wearables, action cameras, security and surveillance cameras, virtual reality headsets, drones and smart city infrastructure. 
At MWC, we announced ecosystem expansion for our next-generation Snapdragon Wear platform, and we are pleased to report that there are now over 100 wearable devices using Qualcomm technology, which includes over 80% of all Android wear smartwatch designs. 
Looking at the IoT more broadly, there are now over 1 billion IoT devices that have shipped using Qualcomm technology. We continue to forecast QCT operating margins of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter and are targeting 20% plus operating margins longer term. It is important to note that for planning purposes, both our near-term and long-term margin targets have consistently factored in a range of second sourcing assumptions at our large customers, and we believe our margin targets are achievable under those scenarios. 
We have strong confidence in our technology leadership, differentiated modem road map and unique global scale. For instance, we recently demonstrated our Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the first commercially announced gigabit-class LTE chipset, designed to deliver fiber-like LTE category 16 download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, at least 2 generations ahead of the competition. This modem also supports Licensed Assisted Access standard for LTE and unlicensed spectrum, becoming the mobile industry's first commercially announced LTE Advanced Pro modem and marks an important step towards 5G as we enable deeper, unlicensed spectrum integration with LTE and more advanced MIMO techniques to support growing data consumption. 
Further, we are leading the world to 5G, as we did in both 3G and 4G. To support this, we are designing a new OFDM-based 5G Air Interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. We demonstrated our 5G millimeter wave, 28 gigahertz prototype system at Mobile World Congress, showcasing robust and sustained mobile broadband communications at these higher spectrum bands. 
Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic plans to position us well for the future. Fiscal 2016 is a transition year, and we are making very good progress. We are taking decisive steps to enable us to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead while delivering improving near-term performance. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek."

As Steve noted, QTL had a stronger-than-expected fiscal second quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $70 billion, reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter. I'm pleased to report that we recently resolved our dispute with LG. As a result of the resolution, we will resume recognizing quarterly LG revenues in fiscal Q3. In addition to recording the revenues, we deferred from the first 2 fiscal quarters. As a reminder, LG continued to report and pay during the dispute. So the sales they reported for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 were included in the total reported device sales for those quarters, but we did not recognize revenues for those quarters given that the arbitration was underway. 
We are also continuing to make steady progress in China, completing new China license agreement. We recently signed new agreements with Lenovo, EWPE, Yulong and High Sense and now have more than 100 companies that have accepted the NDRC terms, including the top 5 worldwide Chinese licensees. Yulong and High Sense were signed after the close of our second fiscal quarter and will be reflected in our third quarter results. 
In addition, we are still actively negotiating with several of the other remaining key Chinese OEMs and are making progress in those discussions. As we explained at our Analyst Day in February, we're also working hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance with our licensees in China. We have begun implementing those plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. 
The percentage of global units not reported to us during the second fiscal quarter increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by share gains from OEMs that have been withholding royalties during license negotiations. Looking ahead, we continue to see growth in global 3G/4G device shipments. LTE penetration is only approximately 16% of cellular connections globally and cumulative smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.7 billion from 2016 through 2020 according to GSM Intelligence and Gartner. 
For calendar year 2015, we now estimate global 3G/4G device shipments were approximately 1.55 billion units, slightly below the midpoint of our prior range and up approximately 13% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in emerging regions, particularly in China, and expect this trend to continue in calendar 2016. We are adjusting our estimate of calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments to 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint, down from our previous midpoint estimate of approximately 10% growth. The strong 4G ramp in China continues, as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings and design momentum is moving rapidly towards all-mode devices across China. 
The strength in China, however, is being offset by a reduction in growth rates in other emerging regions, which we believe is attributable to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, our forecast for premium-tier device shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected upgrades with one -- within one of the premium-tier ecosystems. 
Global 3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking slightly better than our prior expectations of an approximately 6% year-over-year decline for the fiscal year, driven primarily by stronger premium-tier ASPs. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, as unit growth is expected to more than offset ASP declines. Despite adjustments to near-term ship shipment estimates, we believe the long-term growth drivers for 3G/4G device sales remain intact and provide a solid foundation for the licensing business to deliver greater than $10 billion in revenue in our fiscal 2020. 
Turning to our QTL revenue outlook for fiscal 2016. Despite weaker-than-expected unit shipments for the fiscal year, we continue to expect QTL revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Given the weaker-than-expected 3G/4G device demand, we will need to make some additional progress on signing the remaining license agreements in China in order to be within that range but continue to feel that as achievable. As we said at our Analyst Day, although there will be quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide, we estimate a normalized rate for fiscal 2016 will be approximately 2.9%. This is based on adjusting for one-time items and other anomalies such as a difference in timing between when revenues for catch-up payments are recognized and when the related TRDS may be reported. 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China and are pleased to have resolved the LG dispute. We are keenly focused on concluding the right long-term agreements with the remaining China licensees as well as improving compliance and expect continued progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year. That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George."

Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP revenues were $5.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.04, up 7% sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance range. In QCT, MSM shipments were $189 mi",768,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP revenues were $5.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.04, up 7% sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance range. In QCT, MSM shipments were $189 million, 2% above the midpoint of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger demand in China. QCT revenues were $3.3 billion with a sequentially higher implied revenue per MSM. QCT operating margin was 5%, towards the high end of our prior expectations. 
In QTL, total reported device sales and revenues benefited from strength in both developed and emerging regions during the holiday quarter. As a reminder, we report QTL on a one quarter lag, so these results reflect the strength of fourth calendar quarter holiday demand. QTL results also include a one-time revenue benefit of $266 million resulting from the merger of 2 infrastructure licensees as we forecasted on last quarters call. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear license fee amortization of approximately $100 million per quarter as well as the impact of the LG dispute revenue deferral, which will now be included in our fiscal third quarter results, consistent with the settlement announced today. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses decreased 1% sequentially, slightly less than our guidance range due to an increase in legal and litigation-related expenses. 
We returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases at an average price of approximately $49 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $30 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 18%, consistent with our expected rate for the full year. 
Now turning to fiscal 2016. In QTL, as Derek indicated, we continue to forecast revenues will be between $7.3 billion to $8 billion, despite a weaker overall TRDS outlook for the year. In QCT, we continue to see improving demand for premium and high-tier devices in the second half of the fiscal year, offset by reduced demand for thin modem products and low-tier chipsets. 
We remain on track for operating margin of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under the Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016, relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. The summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisitions of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year-over-year. 
Turning to our fiscal third quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.2 billion to $6 billion, up approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint, driven by strong product mix in QCT and the favorable LG dispute resolution in QTL, including catch-up revenues from prior period activity. 
We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be approximately $0.90 to $1 per share, down approximately 4% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be approximately flat sequentially. In QTL, fiscal third quarter revenues will include recognition of more than $200 million that was deferred in the first fiscal and second quarters related to the LG dispute resolution. 
Separately, we estimate total reported device sales between $52 billion and $60 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments. We have not included any potential benefit from license agreements under negotiation, consistent with our prior practice. We expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be down sequentially, in line with seasonal trends reflecting the first calendar quarter. 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 175 million units to 195 million units during the June quarter and expect revenue per MSM to be up more than 10% sequentially. We expect QCT operating margin to improve sequentially and be in the range of 9% to 10% for the fiscal third quarter. These expectations reflect the benefit of a stronger chip road map on both performance and cost leadership across tiers, favorable product mix, growth in adjacent opportunities and lower operating expenses. 
That concludes my comments, and we'll now turn the call back to Warren."

First, I just want to clarify the comments around QTL and its potential licensing. Should we take from your comments that the risk of potentially falling outside of or below the targeted range for this year have gone up? Or you're just trying to clarify that? And I guess my second question is related, and that is as you continue to pursue licensing agreements with some of the larger Chinese OEMs with whom you don't have agreements, does it reach a stage or when do we reach a stage that you may have to start to pursue legal options through the courts there, and what would that look like?"

Thanks, James. Yes, so on the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion, our point was the range was initially defined solely by the outcomes based on our market assumptions at the beginning of the year if we were able to -- if we weren't able to make much progress, we saw ourselves ending up at about $7.3 billion in QTL on the licensing agreements. If we made significant progress, that could take us to $8 billion. Obviously, the LG issue from last quarter created some confusion. We said that was really outside the range. Now that, that has been resolved, what we're saying is that the end market is softer than we had anticipated when we set the range upfront, and that's pulled down the overall size of the market. So we would have to make up some of that in the form of some additional progress on the licensing agreements, and we feel that we're making progress there. So it would be premature to say that we don't believe that we'll end up somewhere in between the $7.3 billion and $8 billion that we started with."

With most of the companies, it would really be more along the lines of an action to enforce their agreement that they have in place today. And like I said, we've been preparing for quite some time to do that if necessary. But so far, I have felt like we're still making enough progress with the licensees and I think the progress that you're seeing through the announcements is supportive of that. And so we're going to keep at it and see if we can get across the finish line without the need for litigation, but of course, that's always an option for us if we need it."

The most -- as we've said, most of the companies that we've been negotiating with to try to conclude agreements on the non-3 mode part of the market had been continuing to report and pay under their agreements. And so when we signed them to the new NDRC terms, it doesn't -- that doesn't result in most cases any significant catch-up on the non-3 mode part of the market. As you noted though, in many cases, it will result in them starting to pay royalties and pay past royalties on 3-mode devices that were previously not licensed. It's turned out so far that a number of the players have been the smaller players in the 3-mode market and so the contributions from that haven't been significant or we've -- the way we've structured the deals in how the past royalties have been structured to be paid over time, those are things that will come into our P&L through probably a period of time later in '16 and maybe even into '17. And so we are getting agreements for those to be paid. It's just that they are been probably spread over a longer time than people anticipate. There are less than a handful of companies that we're in negotiations with that are larger players also on 3 mode and non-3 mode that have not been reporting while they're negotiating. And when we conclude those deals, you would expect to see more significant catch-up payments for prior period sales compared to the ones that we've signed to date."

Should we think about, is the hard work by the end of the fiscal year done that, that level that you're collecting on today would be addressed through deals in reporting? Or is this like -- is this a program and situation that could roll all the way into '17? And then for Cristiano maybe, on the LTE modem, on the last comment you made, I take the point by the way that the carrier aggregation and everything else, it looks like you've lost market share last year in chipset on the wireless side.

And we said, if we completed these remaining negotiations with the handful of companies we have left, that would get us to about 75%-ish collection rate on the TRDS, but that we would continue to have compliance issues that we're going to need to work through. And that really is going to be something that we hope to make progress on and expect to make progress on as we move through '16, but certainly will also be a longer term project. This is -- just there's a fair amount of work involved in it and it's going to take some time. So I think the way to look at it is if we can achieve the results that we hope in the negotiations, we'll have a meaningful step function up on the collections, but to get to the remainder of that 25%-ish is going to take some time."

We feel good about that portfolio. And in China, if you look what happened when China entered 4G, we had -- when we started a transition to 4G, we expected -- over time, we started with very high share, we expected that to normalize over time, but what we're seeing actually in this year, we're doing better than we expected in share in China. And also seeing the impact of those technologies changing the product mix from growth being higher from the low to the mid- and high-tier, showing the modem continues to be a good point of differentiation, even in the growth market like China. I think maybe to clarify this, I believe we have said early in the year, as we went through the SRP, that we were planning so that we could de-risk the market concentration in our planning assumptions. I think that's what we're saying. We're planning that -- we have some planning assumptions, but at the end of the day, we're still designing a very competitive product road map.

And then specifically, when you look at our foundry partners, they were very happy with what we're seeing from a transistor road map out in time, actually from multiple sources. So we feel not only can we compete in the modem tier and the connectivity tiers, but even more importantly, in computing and even computing going into very high-performance computing, we have the transistors to be able to make that successful. So I think we feel very confident both in transistor road map that we're seeing from our suppliers and also with the business model that we will be in a strong position. I think also our scale within the fabless industry is actually helping us a lot in terms of pricing.

But if I look at the -- if I look at -- kind of think about things at the high level, China was not in past quarter outside of the catch-up payment, I think, from Huawei. This year, this quarter, you do have China in, you also have LG in. So why are we seeing -- we don't need much higher contribution of China just on a like-for-like basis. Again, the TRDS between the 2 quarters is down 7.5%, but real revenues are down 11.6%. So you're down more than the TRDS, that's even happening given the China is kicking in this year.

Obviously, we've got kind of a onetime event in Q2 this quarter with the acceleration of the licensee fee that came in, the $266 million-ish payment, but then being offset by the fact that LG revenues are deferred, they're not in the quarter. And then we also have the end of this $100 million-ish a quarter amortization that's reflected in this quarter. Plus as you mentioned a year ago, we had some catch-up payments of about $150 million from the resolution of a prior dispute. And then the China contribution, China was reflected pretty strongly in the year-ago quarter, meaning that was the last quarter that was reported to us before the NDRC resolution, the effect of that took hold in January of 2015. And so one of the other issues you're dealing with, with the year-over-year comparison is you've got application of the NDRC terms now in this quarter. That wasn't a factor a year ago as well as we saw the amount of units that are being underreported accelerate throughout the year last year, in particular related to these negotiations where licensees stopped paying, and that was not really a primary driver in the year-ago quarter.

We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter, as we continued to execute on our strategies to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strength in both QTL and QCT. 
QTL revenues reflect seasonally strong December quarter activity, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in China. We signed several new China licenses in the first few months, with more than 100 companies now having accepted the NDRC terms. We remain in active discussions with the few key Chinese OEMs that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress in those discussions. We are also pleased to have recently resolved our licensing dispute with LG. 
In QCT, our chipset shipments were above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, driven by strong demand from Chinese OEMs, and we had favorable product costs. 
During the quarter, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth. We remain focused on improving our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year, and we are on track in this regard. 
In QCT, we have updated our road map across tiers, and our new products have been very well received. The flagship Snapdragon 820 is now available in leading devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5 and the Xiaomi Mi 5, along with devices from Sony, HTC, HP and others. We now have over 115 Snapdragon 820 designs and expect volume to ramp on this platform through the second half of the fiscal year. 
Our strategy of offering differentiated all-mode modem solutions with carrier aggregation capability is extending our leadership and enabling strong design traction, particularly in China at the mid and high tiers. 
In China, new use cases for carrier aggregation are providing product differentiators for our customers and enhancing our design traction. We are continuing to pursue additional content opportunities in the smartphone and recently announced a suite of next-generation Qualcomm RF360 technologies. 
We are on track to deliver our next-generation CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs in 2017, and will extend our product offerings, including complete RF front-end module solutions once the TDK transaction closes. 
Further, we are broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. Collectively, the serviceable addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years, from $12 billion to $29 billion, according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates. And we are well positioned to benefit from this expanding opportunity. 
We expect these adjacent opportunities to drive approximately $2.5 billion in QCT revenues in fiscal year 2016. We are seeing significant momentum across these areas. In automotive, we have very strong design traction in telematics across Tier 1 manufacturers. With the completion of our CSR acquisition, we now have a comprehensive connectivity portfolio, including Bluetooth smart, WiFi and LTE, which allows us to offer a broader suite of products to our expanded set of customers. 
In networking, we have a strong pipeline of over 240 designs with our 802.11ac solutions across router, home gateway and set-top box implementations. We continue to gain significant traction and win category-defining designs in IoT segments such as wearables, action cameras, security and surveillance cameras, virtual reality headsets, drones and smart city infrastructure. 
At MWC, we announced ecosystem expansion for our next-generation Snapdragon Wear platform, and we are pleased to report that there are now over 100 wearable devices using Qualcomm technology, which includes over 80% of all Android wear smartwatch designs. Looking at the IoT more broadly, there are now over 1 billion IoT devices that have shipped using Qualcomm technology. 
We continue to forecast QCT operating margins of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter and are targeting 20% plus operating margins longer term. It is important to note that for planning purposes, both our near-term and long-term margin targets have consistently factored in a range of second sourcing assumptions at our large customers, and we believe our margin targets are achievable under those scenarios. 
We have strong confidence in our technology leadership, differentiated modem road map and unique global scale. For instance, we recently demonstrated our Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the first commercially announced gigabit-class LTE chipset, designed to deliver fiber-like LTE category 16 download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, at least 2 generations ahead of the competition. This modem also supports Licensed Assisted Access, the global standard for LTE and unlicensed spectrum, becoming the mobile industry's first commercially announced LTE Advanced Pro modem and marks an important step towards 5G as we enable deeper, unlicensed spectrum integration with LTE and more advanced MIMO techniques to support growing data consumption. 
Further, we are leading the world to 5G, as we did in both 3G and 4G. To support this, we are designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. We demonstrated our 5G millimeter wave, 28 gigahertz prototype system at Mobile World Congress, showcasing robust and sustained mobile broadband communications at these higher spectrum bands. 
Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic plans to position us well for the future. Fiscal 2016 is a transition year, and we are making very good progress. We are taking decisive steps to enable us to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead while delivering improving near-term performance. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek."

As Steve noted, QTL had a stronger-than-expected fiscal second quarter, with total reported device sales of approximately $70 billion, reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter.

As Steve noted, QTL had a stronger-than-expected fiscal second quarter, with total reported device sales of approximately $70 billion, reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter. 
I am pleased to report that we recently resolved our dispute with LG. As a result of the resolution, we will resume recognizing quarterly LG revenues in fiscal Q3, in addition to recording the revenues, we deferred from the first 2 fiscal quarters. As a reminder, LG continued to report and pay during the dispute. So the sales they reported for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016 were included in the total reported device sales for those quarters, but we did not recognize revenues for those quarters given that the arbitration was underway. 
We are also continuing to make steady progress in China, completing new China license agreements. We recently signed new agreements with Lenovo, EWPE, Yulong and Hisense and now have more than 100 companies that have accepted the NDRC terms, including the top 5 worldwide Chinese licensees. Yulong and Hisense were signed after the close of our second fiscal quarter and will be reflected in our third quarter results. 
In addition, we are still actively negotiating with several of the other remaining key Chinese OEMs and are making progress in those discussions. As we explained at our Analyst Day in February, we're also working hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance with our licensees in China. We have begun implementing those plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. 
The percentage of global units not reported to us during the second fiscal quarter increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by share gains from OEMs that have been withholding royalties during license negotiations. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see growth in global 3G/4G device shipments. LTE penetration is only approximately 16% of cellular connections globally and cumulative smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.7 billion from 2016 through 2020 according to GSM Intelligence and Gartner. 
For calendar year 2015, we now estimate global 3G/4G device shipments were approximately 1.55 billion units, slightly below the midpoint of our prior range and up approximately 13% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in emerging regions, particularly in China, and expect this trend to continue in calendar 2016. We are adjusting our estimate of calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments to 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint, down from our previous midpoint estimate of approximately 10% growth. The strong 4G ramp in China continues, as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings and design momentum is moving rapidly towards all-mode devices across China. 
The strength in China, however, is being offset by a reduction in growth rates in other emerging regions, which we believe is attributable to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, our forecast for premium-tier device shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected upgrades with one -- within one of the premium-tier ecosystems. 
Global 3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking slightly better than our prior expectations of an approximately 6% year-over-year decline for the fiscal year, driven primarily by stronger premium-tier ASPs. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, as unit growth is expected to more than offset ASP declines. Despite adjustments to near-term shipment estimates, we believe the long-term growth drivers for 3G/4G device sales remain intact and provide a solid foundation for the licensing business to deliver greater than $10 billion in revenue in our fiscal 2020. 
Turning to our QTL revenue outlook for fiscal 2016. Despite weaker-than-expected unit shipments for the fiscal year, we continue to expect QTL revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Given the weaker-than-expected 3G/4G device demand, we will need to make some additional progress on signing the remaining license agreements in China in order to be within that range but continue to feel that is achievable. As we said at our Analyst Day, although there will be quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide, we estimate a normalized rate for fiscal 2016 will be approximately 2.9%. This is based on adjusting for onetime items and other anomalies such as a difference in timing between when revenues for catch-up payments are recognized and when the related TRDS may be reported. 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China and are pleased to have resolved the LG dispute. We are keenly focused on concluding the right long-term agreements with the remaining China licensees, as well as improving compliance and expect continued progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year. 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George."

Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP revenues were $5.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.04, up 7% sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance range. In QCT, MSM shipments were 189 million, 2% above the midpoint of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger demand in China. QCT revenues were $3.3 billion with a sequentially higher implied revenue per MSM. QCT operating margin was 5%, toward the high end of our prior expectations. 
In QTL, total reported device sales and revenues benefited from strength in both developed and emerging regions during the holiday quarter. As a reminder, we report QTL on a 1-quarter lag, so these results reflect the strength of fourth calendar quarter holiday demand. QTL results also include a onetime revenue benefit of $266 million resulting from the merger of 2 infrastructure licensees as we forecasted on last quarter's call. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear license fee amortization of approximately $100 million per quarter, as well as the impact of the LG dispute revenue deferral, which will now be included in our fiscal third quarter results, consistent with the settlement announced today. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses decreased 1% sequentially, slightly less than our guidance range due to an increase in legal- and litigation-related expenses. 
We returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases at an average price of approximately $49 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $30 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 18%, consistent with our expected rate for the full year. 
Now turning to fiscal 2016. In QTL, as Derek indicated, we continue to forecast revenues will be between $7.3 billion to $8 billion, despite a weaker overall TRDS outlook for the year. In QCT, we continue to see improving demand for premium and high-tier devices in the second half of the fiscal year, offset by reduced demand for thin modem products and low-tier chipsets. 
We remain on track for operating margin of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter. We also remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under the Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016, relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. The summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisitions of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year-over-year. 
Turning to our fiscal third quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.2 billion to $6 billion, up approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint, driven by strong product mix in QCT and the favorable LG dispute resolution in QTL, including catch-up revenues from prior-period activity. 
We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be approximately $0.90 to $1 per share, down approximately 4% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be approximately flat sequentially. In QTL, fiscal third quarter revenues will include recognition of more than $200 million that was deferred in the first fiscal and second quarters related to the LG dispute resolution. 
Separately, we estimate total reported device sales between $52 billion and $60 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments. We have not included any potential benefit from license agreements under negotiation, consistent with our prior practice. We expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be down sequentially, in line with seasonal trends reflecting the first calendar quarter. 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 175 million units to 195 million units during the June quarter and expect revenue per MSM to be up more than 10% sequentially. We expect QCT operating margin to improve sequentially and being in the range of 9% to 10% for the fiscal third quarter. These expectations reflect the benefit of a stronger chip road map on both performance and cost leadership across tiers, favorable product mix, growth in adjacent opportunities and lower operating expenses. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

If we made significant progress, that could take us to $8 billion. Obviously, the LG issue from last quarter created some confusion. We said that was really outside the range. Now that, that has been resolved, what we're saying is that the end market is softer than we had anticipated when we set the range upfront, and that's pulled down the overall size of the market. So we would have to make up some of that in the form of some additional progress on the licensing agreements, and we feel that we're making progress there. So it would be premature to say that we don't believe that we'll end up somewhere in between the $7.3 billion and $8 billion that we started with."

With most of the companies, it would really be more along the lines of an action to enforce their agreement that they have in place today.

And so when we sign them to the new NDRC terms, it doesn't -- that doesn't result, in most cases, any significant catch-up on the non-3 mode part of the market. As you noted though, in many cases, it will result in them starting to pay royalties and pay past royalties on 3-mode devices that were previously not licensed. It's turned out so far that a number of the players have been the smaller players in the 3-mode market and so the contributions from that haven't been significant or we've -- the way we've structured the deals in how the past royalties have been structured to be paid over time, those are things that will come into our P&L through probably a period of time later in '16 and maybe even into '17. And so we are getting agreements for those to be paid. It's just that they are been probably spread over a longer time than people anticipate. There are less than a handful of companies that we're in negotiations with that are larger players also on 3 mode and non-3 mode that have not been reporting while they're negotiating.

China continues to be quite strong. And overall, also the ASP picture is looking good as well. We expected moderation in the ASP declines year-over-year and that seems to be at least so far tracking better than our assumption. So we do feel like there is a -- the net-net of that is a bit weaker market for the fiscal year, but we gave a pretty wide range on QTL revenue for the year, just given all the different elements in there. And we felt with still some time left in the year, we do believe we can continue to make progress in China, as we have been demonstrating over the last few months and so, as George mentioned, just felt it was premature to adjust the range. We will need to make more progress relative to where we were before, just given the change in the market, but we still think the range is a reasonable range to hold for now. On the second question, really I think what we're seeing is we are seeing some continued softness in the premium tier. We saw that earlier and our projections were based on that.

Or is this like -- is this a program and situation that could roll all the way into '17? And then for Steve and Cristiano maybe, on the LTE modem, probably on the last comment that you made, I take the point by the way that there's carrier aggregation and everything else. It looks like you lost market share last year in the chipset industry on the wireless side. You probably would -- it sounds that you are -- there's some risk as we go through this year as well.

Obviously, we've got kind of a onetime event in Q2 this quarter with the acceleration of the licensee fee that came in, the $266 million-ish payment, but then being offset by the fact that LG revenues are deferred, they're not in the quarter. And then we also have the end of this $100 million-ish a quarter amortization that's reflected in this quarter. Plus, as you mentioned, a year ago, we had some catch-up payments of about $150 million from the resolution of a prior dispute. And then the China contribution, China was reflected pretty strongly in a year-ago quarter, meaning that was the last quarter that was reported to us before the NDRC resolution, the effect of that took hold in January of 2015. And so one of the other issues you're dealing with, with the year-over-year comparison is you've got application of the NDRC terms now in this quarter that wasn't a factor a year ago, as well as we saw the amount of units that are being underreported accelerate throughout the year last year, in particular related to these negotiations where licensees stopped paying, and that was not really a primary driver in a year-ago quarter.

So if I look at that on a year-over-year basis, it's down kind of high-teens, and obviously, you're gaining some share at a major customer. I assume all of that cannot be related to unit weakness at the other major customer. And yet, everything I hear so far is China's good, China's good. So help me with that disconnect. What's driving that unit growth in light of some share gains at one of your -- or unit decline year-over-year in light of some share gains at one of your larger customers? And then secondly, to help me get to that 16% operating margin guidance for June, should we expect a more material change in the R&D or SG&A line item as we go from Q3 to Q4 than we've seen earlier this year?"

So it's a story more of mix shift. And it's pretty neutral outside of that. And so at the low -- the low-tier units, there tend to be more of those low-tier units that we're trading off, but we're picking up a significant amount of mid-high. In terms of OpEx, we expect OpEx to continue to decrease into the fourth quarter, but I think some of the comparisons that you may be doing would be looking at R&D period-over-period, but in one period, we didn't have the CSR OpEx and in the other period, we do. So just make sure you're doing an apples-to-apples comparison, because we've already seen a fair amount of the reduction already in the base level of OpEx."

We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress in licensing. 
Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our businesses as we position the company for a return to growth. We are investing to expand our technology roadmap and lead in 5G, are pursuing new opportunities in fast-growing areas that build and our core technologies and are committed to operational excellence. 
In QTL, we are pleased to report that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and received reports for a significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making, and we expect that momentum to continue into our fourth fiscal quarter. 
We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution. In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid and high end smartphone tiers, especially with the top 10 vendors in China, are helping to deliver improved financial performance. 
We are also seeing incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations, driven in part by our differentiated all mode and modem leadership. In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs. And we have just announced the Snapdragon 821, which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones, increasingly popular mobile VR headmounted displays and other new devices.
Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid-tiers, as users seek more performance and features in these segments.
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G/4G, 5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor and RF front-end technologies position us well for these new growth areas.
Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from 12 billion to 29 billion according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates. 
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics, where our modem leadership is well recognized; infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors; and in connectivity with our WiFi, Bluetooth and location products. 
Our momentum in IoT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IoT department platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At Computex, we introduced the Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 1100 processor for the fast-growing targeted purpose wearable segments, such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories. 
Our Snapdragon flight platform has helped OEMs quickly commercialize new, smaller, lighter drones leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SOC, connectivity, GPS and drone software solutions. We're also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 designs from more than 60 manufacturers using our low-power LTE IoT more items. 
In networking, we continue to drive the transition to the new wave 2 11ac standard for WiFi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design across mainstream and premium segments. We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next-generation gallium arsenide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the RF front end, positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands in 4G and 5G, and the growth of cellular in IoT. 
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter, and it is important to note that our planning assumptions incorporate second sourcing at our large modem customer. 
Looking forward, our global scale, technology leadership and differentiated chipset roadmap across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future. Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry, and as we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from wireline, requiring devices with ultra high-speed, ultralow latency and ultra- reliable connectivity. The technology roadmap required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in which Qualcomm excels. Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership.
Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing, et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820 processor with X12 LTE. Qualcomm also pioneered 11 -- 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high bands known as millimeter wave to be deployed broadly in 5G.
We are also designing a new OFDM based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services. Our 5G design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms and bands. From low bands below 1 gigahertz to mid-bands from 1 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz to millimeterwave. 5G devices will bring the next level of convergence with ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently.
We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G consistent with our 5G design and development efforts. Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movements in U.S. in Europe, combined with progress on Spectrum Randall Terry front in China, Japan and Korea, are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G. 
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform, operating in spectrum bands beyond 6 gigahertz and showcasing multi gigabit EBIT throughput at low latency. We demonstrated the prototype system at Mobile World Congress Shanghai in collaboration we China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter wave prototype system operating at the 28 gigahertz millimeterwave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband communications in non light of sight environments. 
We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our innovative 5G designs to drive 3G PP, 5G new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network launches. 
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which has played out largely as expected. Our strong results this quarter reflected good progress we have made positioning the company for improved financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and products enabled by our smartphone technologies.
We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that momentum to continue, positioning as well for the future. I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business this quarter, both in terms of new agreements signed and catch-up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion and revenues of $2 billion, driven primarily by the catch-up reporting of certain prior period sales and revenue, as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs. 
As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior 2 fiscal quarters and resumed recognizing quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter, consistent with our prior guidance. 
We continue to make steady progress in China executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been withholding while we continue to negotiate the new agreements. This amounts, plus additional catch-up payments we received from other licensees during the quarter, resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity. QTL revenue for the quarter, therefore, included a total of more than $400 million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up payments.
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take actions against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or underreporting the royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach, engine, with filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property coats in both Beijing and Shanghai China. Regrettably, we've had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights. Headbutt any, to midteens fairness in a level playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the NDRC. 
We're also continuing to record and a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the mid-point. 
We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings and design momentum continues to move rapidly towards all mode devices across China. Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. 
Outside of handsets, growth in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior petitions. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs will decline during fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015. In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to align with our currently of expected progress in China for the remainder of the fiscal year, including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some of the remaining key OEMs within the fiscal year. Although we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect in the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
With respect to the Korean fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and have entered the hearing phase of the commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months. June, which we expect to have the opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea and contrary to the recent press reports, the commission has not reached a decision in our case. In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs, as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal quarter. That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George."

Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow of approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of the year. Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year, including the completion of the remainder of our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. Performance above the high end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress in our licensing business in China. In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million, approximately 9% above the mid-point of our prior guidance range, reflecting greater than expected demand in the low tier particularly in China.
QCT operating margin at 9.5% was in line with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased low tier demand impacting our product mix in revenue per MSM versus expectations. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecast, decreasing 2% sequentially, reflecting continued cost initiatives. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19%, up modestly against expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 80% for fiscal 2016.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the mid-point. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the mid-point. We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting further Strategic Realignment Plan cost actions, particularly in QCT.
In QTL, as Derek mentioned, our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of oil license agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device also of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year-over-year, reflecting a decline in the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing you licensing agreements and a resulting catch-up we expect to receive. Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the remaining agreements in China. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 to 215 million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better consistent with our prior operating margin target.
Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year as well as strong demand for mid-and high tier devices.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our Strategic Realignment Plan and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition-related increases of approximately 5%, adjusting for M&A estimate spending in these areas will be down 7% to 9% year-over-year.
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management while remaining extremely focused on the important role Qualcomm will play as a leading innovator in mobile technology solutions. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

And I think the way to look at that is given the progress that we've made within the last quarter with those companies to rates closing agreements, which aren't yet closed but we are making progress towards that, it sort of put them in a position to feel the right thing to do was to go ahead and report a portion of the prior period sales, which is what rolled through the quarter. Taking that up a level, if you -- as I said, for the year, and at the Analyst Day, we talked about, if we could close these key deals, we would basically be sort of on a run rate basis collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs. And then there will be additional complaints work we would need to do to kind of close the GAP on the remainder. I would say now as a look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal of this year meaning that closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be North of that 75%. And then, of course, we're already actively moving on a number of fronts to improve the compliance and the other areas. So I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans. And as you can see, if there are companies that we believe we're not making progress with and we want conclude agreements with the because they're not negotiating in good faith, we will take action against them. And that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment where there with other companies. But of course, that could change in the future. Our current view, though, is we are making progress, and we have higher confidence now that maybe we did a quarter ago that will be able to close of those deals within a year."

And eventually, those catch-up payments tale of 20 because of the an ongoing run rate and I just want to clarify that's the way it works. And that second part, the detail. Is this move from 75% compliance to move towards the, say, 100%. Is -- as you exit this year is that more about getting your existing licensees that our report 200% compliant other than for all units Chris or is it signing up still further new major vendors?"

On -- we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies of that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter North of $400 million. If you think about 2014, as George mentioned, the way we've looked at that, kind of throw the year, you had a little bit of difference in the way we treated guidance. Meaning, the QTL full year revenue guidance has always included revenues associated with closing new deals. But with that, way we were just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter. Now as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining, and we look at the progress we're making, we've effectively narrowed the range but up of the low end of the range. And as George said, well, we've included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full benefits. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consistent with the low end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then there is incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the quarter, which should we believe is possible, which is why we continue to have a higher range for the full year on QTL. Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is again if we get that done, we will be North of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the underreporting percentage of total global sales would be less than 10%. And then really, to close the gap on that is really a combination, I would say, signing up some of the smaller players, as well as obviously, we have the dispute with Meizu and then driving higher compliance from some of the company's of that are already license and just not reporting their full sales. So it will be kind of a combination of a few different elements of there."

It's been very difficult to build, I would say, high-quality modem business without having the ability to handle all the most that come up. This becomes increasingly important when you're looking to get into SKUs that are sold let's say, worldwide because essentially you get the entire world features that come into your product. And so what you tend to see that people might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion share and certainly, difficult, I think, over time to protect that, those design wins. And we've seen that over a number of generations. And I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G besides just being ahead on 4G was the ability to make it very easy for a multimode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multimode work tends to be extracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important. And I would add in WiFi in many different bands when you go to 5G. So we think that's going to continue to be an important component of our business moving forward. And one of the reasons why we think its important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur. That IoT commit be even becomes more importantly, in my opinion because of the SKU that goes into this industrial applications, you're really trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications at cellular provides.

We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress",1289,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress in licensing.
Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our businesses as we position the company for a return to growth. We are investing to expand our technology road map and lead in 5G, are pursuing new opportunities in fast-growing areas that build on our core technologies and are committed to operational excellence.
In QTL, we are pleased to report that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and received reports for a significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making, and we expect that momentum to continue into our fourth fiscal quarter.
We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution. In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid- and high-end smartphone tiers, especially with the top 10 vendors in China, are helping to deliver improved financial performance.
We are also seeing incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations, driven in part by our differentiated all-mode and modem leadership. In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs. And we have just announced the Snapdragon 821, which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones, increasingly popular mobile VR head-mounted displays and other new devices.
Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid-tiers, as users seek more performance and features in these segments.
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor and RF front-end technologies positions us well for these new growth areas.
Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from 12 billion to 29 billion according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates.
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics, where our modem leadership is well recognized; infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors; and in connectivity with our WiFi, Bluetooth and location products.
Our momentum in IoT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IoT development platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At Computex, we introduced the Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 1100 processor for the fast-growing, targeted purpose wearable segments, such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories.
Our Snapdragon Flight platform has helped OEMs quickly commercialize new, smaller, lighter drones, leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SoC, connectivity, GPS and drone software solutions. We're also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 designs from more than 60 manufacturers using our low-power LTE IoT modems.
In networking, we continue to drive the transition to the new Wave 2 11ac standard for WiFi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design across mainstream and premium segments. We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next-generation gallium arsenide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the RF Front End, positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands in 4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IoT.
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter, and it is important to note that our planning assumptions incorporate second sourcing at our large modem customer.
Looking forward, our global scale, technology leadership and differentiated chipset road map across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future. Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry, and as we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from wireline, requiring devices with ultra high-speed, ultralow latency and ultra-reliable connectivity. The technology road map required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in which Qualcomm excels. Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership.
Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing, et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820 processor with X12 LTE. Qualcomm also pioneered 11 -- 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high bands known as millimeter-wave to be deployed broadly in 5G.
We are also designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services. Our 5G design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms and bands. From low bands below 1 gigahertz to mid-bands from 1 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz to millimeter-wave. 5G devices will bring the next level of convergence with the ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently.
We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G, consistent with our 5G design and development efforts. Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movement in the U.S. and Europe, combined with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan and Korea, are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G.
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform, operating in spectrum bands below 6 gigahertz and showcasing multi gigabit throughput at low latency. We demonstrated the prototype system at Mobile World Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter-wave prototype system operating at the 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband communications in non-line-of-sight environments.
We're utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our innovative 5G designs to drive 3GPP, 5G new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network launches.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which has played out largely as expected. Our strong results this quarter reflected good progress we have made positioning the company for improved financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and products enabled by our smartphone technologies.
We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that momentum to continue, positioning us well for the future. I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309329005,1008928,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business this quarter, both in terms of new agreements signed and catch-up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion and revenues of $2 billion, driven primarily by the catch-up reporting of certain prior period sales and revenue as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs.
As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior 2 fiscal quarters and resumed recognizing quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter, consistent with our prior guidance.
We continue to make steady progress in China executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been withholding while we continue to negotiate their new agreements. These amounts plus additional catch-up payments we received from other licensees during the quarter resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity. QTL revenue for the quarter, therefore, included a total of more than $400 million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up payments.
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or underreporting the royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach, in June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably, we've had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, importantly, to maintain fairness and a level-playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the NDRC. 
We're also continuing to work hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint.
We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G+ service offerings and design momentum continues to move rapidly towards all-mode devices across China. Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.
Outside of handsets, growth in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs will decline during fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015. In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder of the fiscal year, including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some of the remaining key OEMs within the fiscal year. Although we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and have entered the hearing phase with the commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months, during which we expect to have the opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea, and contrary to the recent press reports, the commission has not yet reached a decision in our case. In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal quarter. That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George."

We ended the quarter with cash",756,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow of approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of the year. Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year, including the completion of the remainder of our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. Performance above the high end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress in our licensing business in China. In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million, approximately 9% above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting greater-than-expected demand in the low tier particularly in China.
QCT operating margin at 9.5% was in line with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased low tier demand impacting our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecast, decreasing 2% sequentially, reflecting continued cost initiatives. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19%, up modestly against expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18% for fiscal 2016.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting further Strategic Realignment Plan cost actions, particularly in QCT.
In QTL, as Derek mentioned, our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of all license agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year-over-year, reflecting a decline in the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new licensing agreements and a resulting catch-up we expect to receive. Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the remaining agreements in China. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better, consistent with our prior operating margin target.
Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year as well as strong demand for mid- and high tier devices.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition-related increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas will be down 7% to 9% year-over-year.
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management while remaining extremely focused on the important role Qualcomm will play as a leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

And of course, we reiterated the 16% margin for QCT. And that being said, it'll also benefit from the OpEx actions that we're taking in the quarter as well. So a good story overall for QCT."

So I think the way to look at it is we had this small group of licensees that were withholding their reports and payments while they continue to negotiate. And that was inconsistent with what a lot of the other companies did. And I think the way to look at that is given the progress that we've made within the last quarter with those companies towards closing agreements which aren't yet closed, but we are making progress towards that, sort of put them in a position to feel the right thing to do was to go ahead and report a portion of the prior period sales, which is what rolled through in the quarter. Taking that up a level, if you -- as I said, for the year, and at the Analyst Day, we talked about if we could close these key deals, we would basically be, sort of on a run rate basis, collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs. And then there will be additional compliance work we would need to do to kind of close the gap on the remainder. I would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal this year, meaning closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be north of that 75%. And then, of course, we're already actively moving on a number of fronts to improve the compliance in the other areas. So I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans. And as you can see, if there are companies that we believe we're not making progress with and we won't conclude agreements with because they're not negotiating in good faith, we will take action against them. And that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment we're there with other companies, but of course that could change in the future. Our current view, though, is we are making progress, and we have higher confidence now than maybe we did a quarter ago that we'll be able to close those deals within a year."

It sounds like it was $400 million worth of catch-up payments from Samsung and from the Chinese OEMs. There's going to be catch-up payments already included in your Q4 guidance, implicit for QTL, I assume. And then eventually, those catch-up payments tail off to 0 because of ongoing run rate. So I just want to clarify if that's the way it works. And the second part, the QTL part, this move from 75% compliance to move towards the, say, 100%, is it -- as you exit this year, is that more about getting your existing licensees that are reported in Q2 to 100% comply and report all of their units? Or is it signing up still further new major vendors?"

Yes, on -- we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north of $400 million. If you think about Q4, as George mentioned, the way we've looked at that, kind of throughout the year, we've had a little bit of difference in the way we treated guidance. Meaning, the QTL full year revenue guidance has always included revenues associated with closing new deals. But that -- when we were just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter. Now as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining, and we look at the progress we're making, we've effectively narrowed the range, brought up the low end of the range. And as George said, well, we've included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consistent with the low end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then there is incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the quarter, which we believe is possible, which is why we've continued to have a higher range for the full year on QTL. Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again, if we get that done, we will be north of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the underreporting percentage of total global sales would be less than 10%. And then really, to close the gap on that is going to be a combination of I would say signing up some of the smaller players, as well as obviously, we have the dispute with Meizu, and then driving higher compliance from some of the company's that are already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it will be kind of a combination of a few different elements there."

Q4, we believe will be down sequentially.

As you might remember, some of the guys that we're still negotiating with were larger, historically larger 3-mode players and the rate on 3-mode devices is lower than on other devices. And so that could have, within the quarter, when that catch-up comes in, it could have a dilutive effect.

And it seems to be most of it is done because they have the legacy software to do all of the handoffs in the corner cases that Qualcomm does. So I'm just trying to figure out how that applies to some of the marquee phones that are playing out now. And then in 5G, you see that being a big factor.

It's been very difficult to build, I would say, a high-quality modem business without having the ability to handle all the modes that come up. This becomes increasingly important when you're looking to get into SKUs that are sold, let's say, worldwide because essentially you get the entire world feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is that people might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion's share and certainly difficult, I think, over time to protect that, those design wins. And we've seen that over a number of generations. And I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G besides just being ahead on 4G was the ability to make it very easy for multimode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multimode work tends to be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important. And I would add in WiFi and many different bands when you go to 5G. So we think that's going to continue to be an important component of our business moving forward and one of the reasons why we think it's important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur. With IoT, it even becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU that goes into these industrial applications, you're really trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications that cellular provides. So we think that's not only a defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of Things and the franchise moving forward."

That might be a little bit harder to get after than some of the other pieces. But we're seeing consolidation across the OEMs, both in terms of share and also even some early M&A activity. So the number of players, we believe, will reduce over time. Beyond that, so obviously, legal proceedings will be an element of our compliance efforts, and you've seen that with Meizu, but there are many, many other things we're doing as well both in China. And I talked about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February. But there's a lot of activity we're also doing outside of China in a lot of the other regions in the world that we think have the ability to impact and change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in the past.

We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress in licensing.
Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our businesses as we position the company for a return to growth. We are investing to expand our technology road map and lead in 5G, are pursuing new opportunities in fast-growing areas that build on our core technologies and are committed to operational excellence.
In QTL, we are pleased to report that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and received reports for a significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making, and we expect that momentum to continue into our fourth fiscal quarter.
We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution. In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid- and high-end smartphone tiers, especially with the top 10 vendors in China, are helping to deliver improved financial performance.
We are also seeing incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations, driven in part by our differentiated all-mode and modem leadership. In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs. And we have just announced the Snapdragon 821, which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones, increasingly popular mobile VR head-mounted displays and other new devices.
Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid-tiers, as users seek more performance and features in these segments.
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor and RF front-end technologies positions us well for these new growth areas.
Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from 12 billion to 29 billion according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates.
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics, where our modem leadership is well recognized; infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors; and in connectivity with our WiFi, Bluetooth and location products.
Our momentum in IoT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IoT development platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At Computex, we introduced the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 1100 processor for the fast-growing, targeted purpose wearable segments, such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories.
Our Snapdragon Flight platform has helped OEMs quickly commercialize new, smaller, lighter drones, leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SoC, connectivity, GPS and drone software solutions. 
We're also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 designs from more than 60 manufacturers using our low-power LTE IoT modems.
In networking, we continue to drive the transition to the new Wave 2 11ac standard for WiFi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design across mainstream and premium segments. We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next-generation gallium arsenide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the RF Front End, positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands in 4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IoT.
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter, and it is important to note that our planning assumptions incorporate second sourcing at our large modem customer.
Looking forward, our global scale, technology leadership and differentiated chipset road map across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future. Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry, and as we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from wireline, requiring devices with ultra-high-speed, ultralow latency and ultra-reliable connectivity. The technology road map required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in which Qualcomm excels. 
Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership. Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing, et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820 processor with X12 LTE. Qualcomm also pioneered 11 -- 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high bands known as millimeter-wave to be deployed broadly in 5G.
We are also designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services. Our 5G design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms and bands. From low bands below 1 gigahertz to mid-bands from 1 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz to millimeter-wave, 5G devices will bring the next level of convergence with the ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently.
We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G, consistent with our 5G design and development efforts. Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movement in the U.S. and Europe, combined with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan and Korea, are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G.
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform, operating in spectrum bands below 6 gigahertz and showcasing multi-gigabit throughput at low latency. We demonstrated the prototype system at Mobile World Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter-wave prototype system operating at the 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband communications in non-line-of-sight environments.
We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our innovative 5G designs to drive 3GPP, 5G new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network launches.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which has played out largely as expected. Our strong results this quarter reflect the good progress we have made positioning the company for improved financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and products enabled by our smartphone technologies.
We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that momentum to continue, positioning us well for the future. I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."

As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior 2 fiscal quarters and resumed recognizing quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter, consistent with our prior guidance.
We continue to make steady progress in China executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been withholding while we continue to negotiate their new agreements. These amounts plus additional catch-up payments we received from other licensees during the quarter resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity. QTL revenue for the quarter, therefore, included a total of more than $400 million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up payments.
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or underreporting the royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach, in June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably, we've had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, importantly, to maintain fairness and a level-playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the NDRC. 
We're also continuing to work hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. 
Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint.
We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G+ service offerings and design momentum continues to move rapidly towards all-mode devices across China. Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.
Outside of handsets, growth in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs will decline during fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015. 
In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder of the fiscal year, including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some of the remaining key OEMs within the fiscal year. Although we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate, for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and have entered the hearing phase with the commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months, during which we expect to have the opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea, and contrary to the recent press reports, the commission has not yet reached a decision in our case. 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs, as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George."

We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash",754,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow of approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of the year. 
Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year, including the completion of the remainder of our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. Performance above the high end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress in our licensing business in China. 
In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million, approximately 9% above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting greater-than-expected demand in the low tier particularly in China.
QCT operating margin at 9.5% was in line with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased low-tier demand impacting our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecast, decreasing 2% sequentially, reflecting continued cost initiatives. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19%, up modestly against expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18% for fiscal 2016.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting further Strategic Realignment Plan cost actions, particularly in QCT.
In QTL, as Derek mentioned, our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of all license agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year-over-year, reflecting a decline in the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new licensing agreements and the resulting catch-up we expect to receive. Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the remaining agreements in China. 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better, consistent with our prior operating margin target. Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year, as well as strong demand for mid- and high-tier devices.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition-related increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year-over-year.
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management while remaining extremely focused on the important role Qualcomm will play as a leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

Taking that up a level, if you -- as I said, for the year, and at the Analyst Day, we talked about if we could close these key deals, we would basically be, sort of on a run rate basis, collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs. And then there would be additional compliance work we would need to do to kind of close the gap on the remainder. I would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal this year, meaning closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be north of that 75%. And then, of course, we're already actively moving on a number of fronts to improve the compliance in the other areas. So I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans. And as you can see, if there are companies that we believe we're not making progress with and we won't conclude agreements with because they're not negotiating in good faith, we will take action against them. And that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment we're there with other companies, but of course, that could change in the future.

And then eventually, those catch-up payments tail off to 0 because you use again ongoing run rate. So I just want to clarify if that's the way it works. And the second part of the QTL part is this move from 75% compliance to move towards, let's say, 100%, is it -- as you exit this year, is that more about getting your existing licensees that are reported in QTL 100% comply and report all of their units?

Yes, on -- we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north of $400 million. If you think about Q4, as George mentioned, the way we've looked at that, kind of throughout the year, we've had a little bit of a difference in the way we treated guidance. Meaning, the QTL full year revenue guidance has always included revenues associated with closing new deals. But that when we were just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter. Now as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining, and we look at the progress we're making, we've effectively narrowed the range, brought up the low end of the range. And as George said, well, we've included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consistent with the low end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then there is incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the quarter, which we believe is possible, which is why we've continued to have a higher range for the full year on QTL. Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again, if we get that done, we will be north of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the underreporting percentage of total global sales would be less than 10%. And then really, to close the gap on that is going to be a combination of, I would say, signing up some of the smaller players, as well as obviously, we have the dispute with Meizu, and then driving higher compliance from some of the companies that are already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it'll be kind of a combination of a few different elements there."

As you might remember, some of the guys that we're still negotiating with were larger, historically larger 3-mode players and the rate on 3-mode devices is lower than on other devices.

This becomes increasingly important when you're looking to get into SKUs that are sold, let's say, worldwide because essentially, you get the entire world's feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is that people might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion's share and certainly difficult, I think, over time to protect that, those design wins. And we've seen that over a number of generations. And I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G, besides just being ahead on 4G, was the ability to make it very easy for multimode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multimode work tends to be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important. And I would add in WiFi and many different bands when you go to 5G. So we think that's going to continue to be an important component of our business moving forward and one of the reasons why we think it's important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur. With IoT, it even becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU that goes into these industrial applications, you're really trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications that cellular provide. So we think that's not only a defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of Things and the franchise moving forward."

And I think we've approached it in the right way, which is we have kind of a stage plan. First is to get the key agreements done. I think we're making good progress, as you've seen, on that front. There's a number of in-country, in-China compliance initiatives we have ongoing with existing licensees, including active audit and other efforts to make sure we really have a clear understanding of the market landscape and who's doing what. There will be, I think, a piece of the market that is sort of the long-tail piece that tends to be lower ASP, low cost, lower feature devices. That might be a little bit harder to get after than some of the other pieces. But we're seeing consolidation across the OEMs, both in terms of share and also even some early M&A activity. So the number of players, we believe, will reduce over time. Beyond that, so obviously, legal proceedings will be an element of our compliance efforts, and you've seen that with Meizu, but there are many, many other things we're doing as well both in China. And I talked about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February. But there's a lot of activity we're also doing outside of China in a lot of the other regions in the world that we think have the ability to impact and change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in the past. So litigation will be one tool, but it's not going to be the only tool. And there's other things that are less costly that we think we can do to drive higher compliance over time and big area of focus, obviously, for the business right now."

We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress",1289,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress in licensing.
Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our businesses as we position the company for a return to growth. We are investing to expand our technology road map and lead in 5G, are pursuing new opportunities in fast-growing areas that build on our core technologies and are committed to operational excellence.
In QTL, we are pleased to report that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and received reports for a significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making, and we expect that momentum to continue into our fourth fiscal quarter.
We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution. In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid- and high-end smartphone tiers, especially with the top 10 vendors in China, are helping to deliver improved financial performance.
We are also seeing incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations, driven in part by our differentiated all-mode and modem leadership. In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs. And we have just announced the Snapdragon 821, which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones, increasingly popular mobile VR head-mounted displays and other new devices.
Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid-tiers, as users seek more performance and features in these segments.
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor and RF front-end technologies positions us well for these new growth areas.
Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from 12 billion to 29 billion according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates.
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics, where our modem leadership is well recognized; infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors; and in connectivity with our WiFi, Bluetooth and location products.
Our momentum in IoT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IoT development platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At Computex, we introduced the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 1100 processor for the fast-growing, targeted purpose wearable segments, such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories.
Our Snapdragon Flight platform has helped OEMs quickly commercialize new, smaller, lighter drones, leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SoC, connectivity, GPS and drone software solutions. 
We're also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 designs from more than 60 manufacturers using our low-power LTE IoT modems.
In networking, we continue to drive the transition to the new Wave 2 11ac standard for WiFi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design across mainstream and premium segments. We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next-generation gallium arsenide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the RF Front End, positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands in 4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IoT.
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter, and it is important to note that our planning assumptions incorporate second sourcing at our large modem customer.
Looking forward, our global scale, technology leadership and differentiated chipset road map across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future. Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry, and as we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from wireline, requiring devices with ultra-high-speed, ultralow latency and ultra-reliable connectivity. The technology road map required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in which Qualcomm excels. 
Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership. Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing, et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820 processor with X12 LTE. Qualcomm also pioneered 11 -- 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high bands known as millimeter-wave to be deployed broadly in 5G.
We are also designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services. Our 5G design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms and bands. From low bands below 1 gigahertz to mid-bands from 1 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz to millimeter-wave, 5G devices will bring the next level of convergence with the ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently.
We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G, consistent with our 5G design and development efforts. Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movement in the U.S. and Europe, combined with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan and Korea, are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G.
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform, operating in spectrum bands below 6 gigahertz and showcasing multi-gigabit throughput at low latency. We demonstrated the prototype system at Mobile World Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter-wave prototype system operating at the 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband communications in non-line-of-sight environments.
We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our innovative 5G designs to drive 3GPP, 5G new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network launches.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which has played out largely as expected. Our strong results this quarter reflect the good progress we have made positioning the company for improved financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and products enabled by our smartphone technologies.
We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that momentum to continue, positioning us well for the future. I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309329005,1009702,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business this quarter, both in terms of new agreements signed and catch-up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion and revenues of $2 billion, driven primarily by the catch-up reporting of certain prior period sales and revenue as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs.
As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior 2 fiscal quarters and resumed recognizing quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter, consistent with our prior guidance.
We continue to make steady progress in China executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been withholding while we continue to negotiate their new agreements. These amounts plus additional catch-up payments we received from other licensees during the quarter resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity. QTL revenue for the quarter, therefore, included a total of more than $400 million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up payments.
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or underreporting the royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach, in June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably, we've had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, importantly, to maintain fairness and a level-playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the NDRC. 
We're also continuing to work hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. 
Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint.
We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G+ service offerings and design momentum continues to move rapidly towards all-mode devices across China. Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.
Outside of handsets, growth in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs will decline during fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015. 
In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder of the fiscal year, including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some of the remaining key OEMs within the fiscal year. Although we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate, for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and have entered the hearing phase with the commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months, during which we expect to have the opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea, and contrary to the recent press reports, the commission has not yet reached a decision in our case. 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George."

We ended the quarter with cash",754,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow of approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of the year. 
Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year, including the completion of the remainder of our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. Performance above the high end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress in our licensing business in China. 
In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million, approximately 9% above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting greater-than-expected demand in the low tier particularly in China.
QCT operating margin at 9.5% was in line with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased low-tier demand impacting our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecast, decreasing 2% sequentially, reflecting continued cost initiatives. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19%, up modestly against expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18% for fiscal 2016.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting further Strategic Realignment Plan cost actions, particularly in QCT.
In QTL, as Derek mentioned, our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of all license agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year-over-year, reflecting a decline in the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new licensing agreements and the resulting catch-up we expect to receive. Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the remaining agreements in China. 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better, consistent with our prior operating margin target. Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year as well as strong demand for mid- and high-tier devices.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition-related increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year-over-year.
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management while remaining extremely focused on the important role Qualcomm will play as a leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

So I think the way to look at it is we had this small group of licensees that were withholding their reports and payments while they continue to negotiate. And that was inconsistent with what a lot of the other companies did. And I think the way to look at that is given the progress that we've made within the last quarter with those companies towards closing agreements, which aren't yet closed but we are making progress towards that, sort of put them in a position to feel the right thing to do was to go ahead and report a portion of the prior period sales, which is what rolled through in the quarter. Taking that up a level, if you -- as I said, for the year, and at the Analyst Day, we talked about if we could close these key deals, we would basically be, sort of on a run rate basis, collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs. And then there would be additional compliance work we would need to do to kind of close the gap on the remainder. I would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal this year, meaning closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be north of that 75%. And then, of course, we're already actively moving on a number of fronts to improve the compliance in the other areas. So I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans. And as you can see, if there are companies that we believe we're not making progress with and we won't conclude agreements with because they're not negotiating in good faith, we will take action against them. And that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment we're there with other companies, but of course, that could change in the future. Our current view, though, is we are making progress, and we have higher confidence now than maybe we did a quarter ago that we'll be able to close those deals within a year."

And then eventually, those catch-up payments tail off to 0 because you use again ongoing run rate. So I just want to clarify if that's the way it works. And the second part of the QTL part is this move from 75% compliance to move towards, let's say, 100%, is it -- as you exit this year, is that more about getting your existing licensees that are reported in QTL 100% comply and report all of their units? Or is it signing up still further new major vendors?"

Yes, on -- we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north of $400 million. If you think about Q4, as George mentioned, the way we've looked at that, kind of throughout the year, we've had a little bit of a difference in the way we treated guidance. Meaning, the QTL full year revenue guidance has always included revenues associated with closing new deals. But that when we were just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter. Now as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining, and we look at the progress we're making, we've effectively narrowed the range, brought up the low end of the range. And as George said, well, we've included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consistent with the low end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then there is incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the quarter, which we believe is possible, which is why we've continued to have a higher range for the full year on QTL. Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again, if we get that done, we will be north of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the underreporting percentage of total global sales would be less than 10%. And then really, to close the gap on that is going to be a combination of, I would say, signing up some of the smaller players as well as obviously, we have the dispute with Meizu, and then driving higher compliance from some of the companies that are already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it'll be kind of a combination of a few different elements there."

As you might remember, some of the guys that we're still negotiating with were larger, historically larger 3-mode players and the rate on 3-mode devices is lower than on other devices.

Also, of course, the adjacent businesses contribute to that as well as they did in the third quarter. We're not going to guide '17 at this time.

I think the ability to drive gigabit LTE technology with 4G using advanced RF techniques is going to be key to drive a transition to 5G. And I think in addition to that, we see both the WiFi and the LTE evolving at the same time, across license in a licensed spectrum, as in licensed spectrum with 3GPP is standard, it's called LAA, and licensed spectrum becomes available. That's going to give many operators worldwide the ability to get to gigabit speeds. And we're very confident about the ability to do that with our road map."

So you'll have in-quarter activity plus catch-up payments related to those agreements when they get signed.

It's been very difficult to build, I would say, a high-quality modem business without having the ability to handle all the modes that come up. This becomes increasingly important when you're looking to get into SKUs that are sold, let's say, worldwide because essentially, you get the entire world's feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is that people might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion's share and certainly difficult, I think, over time to protect that, those design wins. And we've seen that over a number of generations. And I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G, besides just being ahead on 4G, was the ability to make it very easy for multimode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multimode work tends to be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important. And I would add in WiFi and many different bands when you go to 5G. So we think that's going to continue to be an important component of our business moving forward and one of the reasons why we think it's important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur. With IoT, it even becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU that goes into these industrial applications, you're really trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications that cellular provide. So we think that's not only a defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of Things and the franchise moving forward."

There's a number of in-country, in-China compliance initiatives we have ongoing with existing licensees, including active audit and other efforts to make sure we really have a clear understanding of the market landscape and who's doing what. There will be, I think, a piece of the market that is sort of the long-tail piece that tends to be lower ASP, low cost, lower feature devices. That might be a little bit harder to get after than some of the other pieces. But we're seeing consolidation across the OEMs, both in terms of share and also even some early M&A activity. So the number of players, we believe, will reduce over time. Beyond that, so obviously, legal proceedings will be an element of our compliance efforts, and you've seen that with Meizu, but there are many, many other things we're doing as well both in China. And I talked about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February. But there's a lot of activity we're also doing outside of China in a lot of the other regions in the world that we think have the ability to impact and change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in the past.

In QTL, we are pleased to report that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and received reports for a significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making, and we expect that momentum to continue into our fourth fiscal quarter.
We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution. In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid- and high-end smartphone tiers, especially with the top 10 vendors in China, are helping to deliver improved financial performance.
We are also seeing incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations, driven in part by our differentiated all-mode and modem leadership. In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs. And we have just announced the Snapdragon 821, which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones, increasingly popular mobile VR head-mounted displays and other new devices.
Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid-tiers, as users seek more performance and features in these segments.
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor and RF front-end technologies positions us well for these new growth areas.
Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years from 12 billion to 29 billion according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates.
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics, where our modem leadership is well recognized; infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors; and in connectivity with our WiFi, Bluetooth and location products.
Our momentum in IoT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IoT development platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At Computex, we introduced the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 1100 processor for the fast-growing, targeted purpose wearable segments, such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories.
Our Snapdragon Flight platform has helped OEMs quickly commercialize new, smaller, lighter drones, leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SoC, connectivity, GPS and drone software solutions. 
We're also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 designs from more than 60 manufacturers using our low-power LTE IoT modems.
In networking, we continue to drive the transition to the new Wave 2 11ac standard for WiFi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design across mainstream and premium segments. We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next-generation gallium arsenide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the RF Front End, positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands in 4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IoT.
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter, and it is important to note that our planning assumptions incorporate second sourcing at our large modem customer.
Looking forward, our global scale, technology leadership and differentiated chipset road map across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future. Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry, and as we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from wireline, requiring devices with ultra-high-speed, ultralow latency and ultra-reliable connectivity. The technology road map required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in which Qualcomm excels. 
Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership. Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing, et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820 processor with X12 LTE. Qualcomm also pioneered 11 -- 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high bands known as millimeter-wave to be deployed broadly in 5G.
We are also designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services. Our 5G design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms and bands. From low bands below 1 gigahertz to mid-bands from 1 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz to millimeter-wave, 5G devices will bring the next level of convergence with the ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently.
We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G, consistent with our 5G design and development efforts. Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movement in the U.S. and Europe, combined with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan and Korea, are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G.
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform, operating in spectrum bands below 6 gigahertz and showcasing multi-gigabit throughput at low latency. We demonstrated the prototype system at Mobile World Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter-wave prototype system operating at the 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband communications in non-line-of-sight environments.
We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our innovative 5G designs to drive 3GPP, 5G new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network launches.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which has played out largely as expected. Our strong results this quarter reflect the good progress we have made positioning the company for improved financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and products enabled by our smartphone technologies.
We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that momentum to continue, positioning us well for the future. I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle."
33493,309329005,1011557,"QUALCOMM Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","QUALCOMM Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business this quarter, both in terms of new agreements signed and catch-up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quar",798,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business this quarter, both in terms of new agreements signed and catch-up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion and revenues of $2 billion, driven primarily by the catch-up reporting of certain prior period sales and revenue as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs.
As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior 2 fiscal quarters and resumed recognizing quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter, consistent with our prior guidance.
We continue to make steady progress in China executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been withholding while we continue to negotiate their new agreements. These amounts plus additional catch-up payments we received from other licensees during the quarter resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity. QTL revenue for the quarter, therefore, included a total of more than $400 million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up payments.
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or underreporting the royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach, in June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably, we've had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, importantly, to maintain fairness and a level-playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the NDRC. 
We're also continuing to work hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. 
Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint.
We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G+ service offerings and design momentum continues to move rapidly towards all-mode devices across China. Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.
Outside of handsets, growth in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs will decline during fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015. 
In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder of the fiscal year, including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some of the remaining key OEMs within the fiscal year. Although we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate, for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and have entered the hearing phase with the commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months, during which we expect to have the opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea, and contrary to the recent press reports, the commission has not yet reached a decision in our case. 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal quarter. 
That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George."

We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash",754,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow of approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of the year. 
Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year, including the completion of the remainder of our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. 
Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. Performance above the high end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress in our licensing business in China. 
In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million, approximately 9% above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting greater-than-expected demand in the low tier particularly in China.
QCT operating margin at 9.5% was in line with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased low-tier demand impacting our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecast, decreasing 2% sequentially, reflecting continued cost initiatives. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19%, up modestly against expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18% for fiscal 2016.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting further Strategic Realignment Plan cost actions, particularly in QCT.
In QTL, as Derek mentioned, our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of all license agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year-over-year, reflecting a decline in the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new licensing agreements and the resulting catch-up we expect to receive. Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the remaining agreements in China. 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better, consistent with our prior operating margin target. Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year as well as strong demand for mid- and high-tier devices.
Now turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our Strategic Realignment Plan, and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition-related increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year-over-year.
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management while remaining extremely focused on the important role Qualcomm will play as a leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren."

Taking that up a level, if you -- as I said, for the year, and at the Analyst Day, we talked about if we could close these key deals, we would basically be, sort of on a run rate basis, collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs. And then there would be additional compliance work we would need to do to kind of close the gap on the remainder. I would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal this year, meaning closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be north of that 75%. And then, of course, we're already actively moving on a number of fronts to improve the compliance in the other areas. So I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans.

And that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment we're there with other companies, but of course, that could change in the future. Our current view, though, is we are making progress, and we have higher confidence now than maybe we did a quarter ago that we'll be able to close those deals within a year."

Derek for you. Just a clarification on the licensing side. So it sounds like it was $400 million worth of catch-up payments with Samsung and from the Chinese OEMs. There's going to be catch-up payments already included in your Q4 guidance, implicit for QTL, I assume. And then eventually, those catch-up payments tail off to 0 because you use again ongoing run rate. So I just want to clarify if that's the way it works. And the second part of the QTL part is this move from 75% compliance to move towards, let's say, 100%, is it -- as you exit this year, is that more about getting your existing licensees that are reported in QTL 100% comply and report all of their units? Or is it signing up still further new major vendors?"

Yes, on -- we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north of $400 million. If you think about Q4, as George mentioned, the way we've looked at that, kind of throughout the year, we've had a little bit of a difference in the way we treated guidance. Meaning, the QTL full year revenue guidance has always included revenues associated with closing new deals. But that when we were just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter. Now as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining, and we look at the progress we're making, we've effectively narrowed the range, brought up the low end of the range. And as George said, well, we've included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consistent with the low end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then there is incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the quarter, which we believe is possible, which is why we've continued to have a higher range for the full year on QTL. Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again, if we get that done, we will be north of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the underreporting percentage of total global sales would be less than 10%. And then really, to close the gap on that is going to be a combination of, I would say, signing up some of the smaller players as well as obviously, we have the dispute with Meizu, and then driving higher compliance from some of the companies that are already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it'll be kind of a combination of a few different elements there."

As you might remember, some of the guys that we're still negotiating with were larger, historically larger 3-mode players and the rate on 3-mode devices is lower than on other devices.

The way to think about it though is sort of the 2 of the larger companies that we've been negotiating with and have been withholding payments this quarter reported, and we recognized more than $200 million of catch-up payments related to them. That's not the entirety of the catch-up amount but it's obviously a significant portion. And then as you think about what catch-up means, there's obviously some 2015 activity. But now we're halfway, essentially halfway through 2016. So there will be additional catch-up. So you'll have in-quarter activity plus catch-up payments related to those agreements when they get signed. And if that happens in the fourth quarter, they would roll through there, but pretty hard for us to give more color than that just given the timing uncertainty of when they'll get done and how much it will roll through in the quarter."

And as I've said in the past, we do believe there's an opportunity to monetize the remainder of the portfolio. Our focus has been really sort of a sequence approach, meaning, try to get through the -- all of the key deals covering the 3G/4G portfolio. And I think we're getting towards the finish line on that. And then once we do that, I think there's a number of different opportunities and ways that we're thinking through monetizing the remainder of the portfolio.

It's been the case, a lot of folks have entered the modem business with great plans and almost all of them have fallen away. And it seems to be most of it is done because they don't have the legacy software to do all of the handoffs in the corner [ph] cases that Qualcomm does. So I'm just trying to figure out how that applies to some of the marquee phones that are playing out now. And then into 5G, do you see that being a big factor?

It's been very difficult to build, I would say, a high-quality modem business without having the ability to handle all the modes that come up. This becomes increasingly important when you're looking to get into SKUs that are sold, let's say, worldwide because essentially, you get the entire world's feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is that people might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion's share and certainly difficult, I think, over time to protect that, those design wins. And we've seen that over a number of generations. And I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G, besides just being ahead on 4G, was the ability to make it very easy for multimode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multimode work tends to be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important. And I would add in WiFi and many different bands when you go to 5G. So we think that's going to continue to be an important component of our business moving forward and one of the reasons why we think it's important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur. With IoT, it even becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU that goes into these industrial applications, you're really trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications that cellular provide. So we think that's not only a defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of Things and the franchise moving forward."

And I think we've approached it in the right way, which is we have kind of a stage plan. First is to get the key agreements done. I think we're making good progress, as you've seen, on that front. There's a number of in-country, in-China compliance initiatives we have ongoing with existing licensees, including active audit and other efforts to make sure we really have a clear understanding of the market landscape and who's doing what. There will be, I think, a piece of the market that is sort of the long-tail piece that tends to be lower ASP, low cost, lower feature devices. That might be a little bit harder to get after than some of the other pieces. But we're seeing consolidation across the OEMs, both in terms of share and also even some early M&A activity. So the number of players, we believe, will reduce over time. Beyond that, so obviously, legal proceedings will be an element of our compliance efforts, and you've seen that with Meizu, but there are many, many other things we're doing as well both in China. And I talked about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February. But there's a lot of activity we're also doing outside of China in a lot of the other regions in the world that we think have the ability to impact and change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in the past. So litigation will be one tool, but it's not going to be the only tool.

We delivered strong results this quarter with better-than-expected earnings per share, reflecting continued discipline execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We had a very productive year. QCT delivered the improved operating margin target we set last year, and QTL made additional progress on new license agreements in China. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire NXP, an established global leader in industrial-grade computing, security, sensors, RF and networking. The proposed NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy in growth areas with complementary and world-class technology, products, customer relationships and strong sales channels across automotive, IoT, security and networking. 
Our strategy and disciplined execution has put us in an excellent position to maintain our leading position in mobile and strengthen it into the next wave of growth, and we continue to invest in technology leadership. Just as we led each mobile technology transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G/LTE, we are leading the way to 5G. Further, 5G will be the communications fabric for our emerging hyper-connected world. 
In our licensing business, we continue to execute well as we enable the industry to benefit from the tremendous opportunities around the world, including in China. We have now signed license agreements with 9 of the top 10 largest Chinese OEMs according to calendar second quarter 2016 global IDC data. We expect to continue to sign additional licenses with Chinese OEMs and increase the level of compliance throughout fiscal 2017. 
Looking ahead, we are very excited about the future. We have spent the last 30 years interconnecting people. We will spend the next 30 years interconnecting their worlds by building on our mobile technology leadership in advanced computing, connectivity and communication systems. Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies, and our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments.
As evidenced by our fiscal fourth quarter results, we continue to drive operational and financial discipline to execute on our strategy to create a competitive cost structure, and we continue to focus our investments in new growth areas. 
As we've executed this strategy to drive profitable growth, we've maintained our strong balance sheet and commitment to attractive capital returns, returning $6.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year and $21 billion over the last 2 years. We believe we are on a path to build Qualcomm into the semiconductor engine with a connected world.
Turning to our QCT business. We continue to invest to lead the industry. In the premium tier, the Snapdragon 820 is in more than 150 smartphone and tablet designs, including iconic devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 edge, the Xiaomi Mi5 and the LG G5. And this past quarter, we announced the follow-on Snapdragon 821 that was recently launched in Google's Pixel. 
In October, we hosted our annual 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong, where we announced new products in the high and mid-tier segments with the Snapdragon 653, Snapdragon 626 and Snapdragon 427 designed for enhanced experiences and improved connectivity. All 3 processors feature the X9 LTE modem capable of 300 megabits per second on the downlink and 150 megabits per second on the uplink. We continue to extend our modem leadership across tiers and lead the industry to 5G. Our Snapdragon X12 LTE modem, which features such as carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256-QAM modulation, is capable of supporting 600 megabits per second on the downlink. Recently, T-Mobile launched the first 4x4 MIMO technology service with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and has publicly talked about plans for implementing 256-QAM in the near future. SKT and Telstra have launched similar capabilities, and we expect to soon see other operators do the same. 
In February, we announced our Snapdragon X16 modem, capable of Gigabit Class LTE speeds, and we recently announced the world's first Gigabit Class LTE mobile device and gigabit-ready network in collaboration with Telstra, Ericsson and NETGEAR. This modem also includes support for LAA, the global standard for deploying LTE in unlicensed spectrum. The FCC recently began issuing equipment authorizations for LAA, and we received the first. 
We also recently announced our first 5G modem, which will support early 5G trials and deployments. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem is designed to support peak download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second and will initially support 28 gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum. The first 5G commercial products that will integrate the Snapdragon X50 5G modem are expected to be available during the first half of 2018.
In addition, Qualcomm is accelerating the path to 5G NR, the global 5G standard for a 5G new radio standardized by 3GPP. 5G NR is expected to not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services.
In January, we announced our planned joint venture with TDK to enable delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and IoT. The joint venture will draw upon TDK's capabilities and micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging, and module integration technologies and our expertise in advanced wireless technologies to serve customers with leading-edge RF solutions into fully integrated systems. 
In our adjacent businesses, fiscal 2016 revenues were up more than 40% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto, networking and the addition of the CSR business. For IoT, we are leveraging our leadership in both connectivity and computing to deliver platforms to help accelerate adoption across multiple device types. We now offer over 25 platforms that help manufacturers quickly and cost effectively deliver IoT products, including the Snapdragon VR820 virtual reality reference platform in a suite of connected camera solutions. 
Smartwatches using Snapdragon Wear processors continue to be launched or announced, and drones using our Snapdragon Flight platform are already commercially available in the U.S. and China ahead of the holiday season. 
There is also an increasing trend to use LTE connectivity for IoT. Building off the 100-plus designs we announced in June using the MDM 9x07 LTE modems, we have recent traction among many ecosystem players for the MDM9206 category, M1/MB1 modems featuring a purpose-built design for IoT with lower power consumption and longer-range connectivity than previous LTE generations.
We are broadening distribution of Snapdragon processors with 2 announced parts, the 410E and 600E, available globally by third-party distributors. 
In automotive, we expanded our design win momentum with global automakers across telematics, connectivity and infotainment. We maintained our position as the leading supplier of modems for telematics, benefiting from increased cellular attach rates in cars and the transition to 4G/LTE vehicle solutions. And with the pending addition of the NXP business, we will have the breadth of technology and products that capture even more of the opportunity in these rapidly growing adjacent areas.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a very productive year for Qualcomm. Our strong results this quarter reflect the progress on our strategy and disciplined execution for technology leadership in mobile and new growth areas. We are excited about the future as we continue to build Qualcomm as the semiconductor engine for the connected world.

As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion and total reported device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of key license agreements in China as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs. QTL revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than our prior guidance based on the timing of concluding the key new license agreement in China.
Total reported device sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were also above our prior guidance with reported 3G/4G device shipments at a record 403 million units and ASPs at $184. QTL continues to make good progress in China, both in terms of signing new license agreements and collecting catch-up amounts for prior period sales. 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed new agreements with both vivo and OPPO and recorded catch-up revenues related to prior quarter sales, including a significant amount for prior period 3-mode sales.
The externally implied royalty rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 2.5%, reflecting the impact of the catch-up amounts in the quarter, which included significant royalties from 3-mode device shipments and other device shipments in China. 
In fiscal 2016, QTL revenues were $7.66 billion with total reported device sales of $267.4 billion, reflecting continued handset growth, particularly at Chinese OEMs, and catch-up amounts for prior period sales. The externally implied royalty rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 2.9% as expected. Excluding catch-up amounts related to sales prior to fiscal 2016, the multiyear amortization from the agreement that expired after the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as the acceleration of the license fees for the terminated infrastructure agreement we previously disclosed, we estimate that fiscal year 2016 QTL revenues would have been approximately $7.2 billion. 
We estimate that we collected royalties on approximately 73% of both 3-mode and non-3-mode Chinese OEM global device sales in fiscal 2016. As discussed last quarter, we initiated litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, equally importantly, to prevent Meizu from continuing to compete unfairly against our other licensees that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements with Qualcomm consistent with the resolution we reached with the NDRC.
In June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. And last month, we filed the complaint with the United States ITC, a patent infringement action in Germany and an infringement seizure action in France. 
Regarding the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and are currently in the hearing phase with the commissioners. We have been providing further responses to the case team's report. 
Turning to our expectations for global 3G/4G device shipments. In calendar 2016, we estimate 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices will be shipped, consistent with our prior forecast, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the mid-point. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings, and design momentum continues to drive an increasing percentage of all mode devices across China.
We estimate that the global ASP for handset shipped during our fiscal 2016 was approximately $185, reflecting an annual decline of approximately 6%, which is in line with our prior forecast. As we expected, the year-over-year handset ASP erosion moderated significantly in fiscal 2016 to approximately half of the rate we experienced during fiscal 2015. 
Looking ahead to calendar 2017, we expect continued year-over-year 3G/4G device shipment growth. We estimate 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices will be shipped during calendar 2017 with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We forecast healthy 3G/4G handset shipment growth to continue in calendar 2017, driven primarily by emerging regions, particularly in India. We expect that the annual erosion in the ASP for handsets shipped during fiscal 2017 will further moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, driving mid-single-digit year-over-year global handset sales growth.
We expect strong growth in 3G/4G-connected IoT device shipments in calendar 2017, driven by the increasing demands of industrial and commercial applications within the smart cities, connected home, wearables and consumer electronics segments. Additionally, several of the world's largest cellular providers are expected to launch commercial operations of scalable, narrowband LTE platforms in the coming year. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and continue to see favorable trends for global 3G/4G device sales. We are focused on concluding additional licensing agreements and improving compliance in fiscal 2017.

I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered",893,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Our performance was strong in both QTL and QCT relative to expectations. The incremental EPS results that were above the high end of our guidance range were largely driven by the new license agreements and related catch-up payments Derek described, along with stronger-than-expected performance in our investment portfolio. 
In QTL, in addition to the new licenses and related catch-up, stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs also contributed to the above-expectation TRDS results. 
QCT had revenues of $4.1 billion, reflecting MSM shipments modestly above the midpoint of expectations, driven by higher demand in thin modems and from OEMs in China. Revenue per MSM was modestly higher sequentially, primarily due to growth in adjacent businesses. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 3% sequentially, as expected, on cost controls and spending reductions under our Strategic Realignment Plan.
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to stockholders, including approximately $780 million of dividends paid and $225 million in share repurchases. For the full year in 2016, we returned just over 100% of free cash flow to our stockholders and share repurchases of $3.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.
Our goals for fiscal 2016 were designed to improve our cost structure while repositioning the company to capture the next phase of growth. We set 3 primary guidance points for 2016 as a result.
First, we're committed to making significant progress on signing new licenses under the improved terms in China and provided a revenue target range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion for QTL. We executed well on that plan by signing key license agreements with leading Chinese OEMs and delivered approximately $7.66 billion in revenue in the year.
Second, we set an ambitious $1.4 billion spending reduction program, which was comprised of $1.1 billion in savings in operating expenses and engineering costs in [ph] COGS, and a $300 million reduction in the annual agreement of share-based compensation. The program was fully realized by the end of fiscal 2016. A comparison of the program reductions against the SRP baseline is found on our website in our quarterly investor deck. 
Finally, we targeted to exit fiscal 2016 with a minimum of 16% or better operating margin in QCT for the fourth quarter, which was met, as we reported 16.6% in that quarter.
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.7 billion to $6.5 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.12 to $1.22 per share, down 9% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. 
In QTL, we expect total reported device sales of approximately $58 billion to $66 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 16% sequentially at the midpoint, primarily as a result of the timing of signing new license agreements and related catch-up payments recorded in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
In QCT, we expect approximately 205 million to 225 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 2% sequentially and reflecting seasonally strong demand primarily from OEMs in China across a broad range of products. Share loss at a large thin modem customer is expected to moderate than normally strong seasonal MSM shipments trend in the December quarter. We expect QCT's operating margin percentage to be within approximately 100 basis points of the fourth fiscal quarter. Both of our businesses are seeing a modest impact in their outlook for the quarter as a result of a major customer's product launch challenges.
Turning to 2017. We're providing selective guidance points for the year. We are estimating mid-single-digit percentage growth for global 3G/4G handset sales for fiscal 2017 and 7% growth at the midpoint in calendar year 2017 3G/4G global device shipments, as Derek described.
Consistent with last fiscal year and aligned with our semiconductor and large-cap tech peers, we are not providing fiscal year revenue or earnings per share guidance.
We estimate our non-GAAP fiscal 2017 tax rate to be approximately 18%. As we discussed last week when we announced the proposed acquisition of NXP, we are modifying our capital return program ahead of the expected close of the transaction later in calendar 2017. However, we remain firmly committed to our current dividend program and to continuing to grow our dividend in the future. We are also committed to share repurchases at a level that at least offsets dilution. Depending on the level of stock option exercises by our employees, we could return close to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 2017, as our outstanding stock options have approximately 2 years on average remaining on their lives. We expect to delever quickly after the NXP transaction is closed, providing a strong foundation for future capital returns and enabling us to approach our pre-transaction leverage ratios within 2 years of transaction close.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John."

And then my second question is that, George, you touched a little bit about that -- your expectation that QCT margin should be within about 100 bps of what you put up for the September quarter -- in the December quarter. But how should we think about QCT margins on more medium- to long-term basis? Are we kind of at a new low? Or is this a new baseline?

I think it also depends on where you're looking in the world. If you look in China, for example. I think the migration tool uplink carrier aggregation and the 4G plus has really been helping the business, actually. So I think that's an area where a feature leadership in the modem has certainly been able to be highly correlated, actually, with success. But you're right, in some areas, we have seen people either defeature or go with a less advanced modem. Now the way we think about that is in that the networks themselves are moving, and that's not a sustainable, long-term position to be in. When we look at teardowns, when we look at comparisons between competitors parts, the tier downs are very consistent with our be in terms of modem leadership. We are getting feedback from operators that they do want to upgrade their modems and actually, that includes their end market devices. The pressure to go to gigabit class modems as well as 5G, we think set up a good environment for us. But we do like the position of having modem leadership in the future, and we think we're going to be able to maintain that. We did, as you know, have to make some changes to our cost structure to make sure that we can sustain an environment where maybe that isn't always the case at any particular moment, but we still think that strong strategic ground to hold."

And we kind of over delivered on that in terms of concluding additional deals, which brought us above our Q4 guide. and right around the mid-point of the annual fiscal year guidance.

So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal '17, the externally flag rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit, quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were North of 3.2%. Then this quarter its swings down to 2.5%. Really, the main driver in this quarter was the amount of catch-up that came in within the quarter both all of it really coming from Chinese OEMs, the combination of folks reporting under the NDRC terms, but also a significant portion of that under the lower rates that apply to 3 mode. So we think that's largely sort of a historical thing. If you look at the projections for 3 mode in China, there are expected to be below 30% of the volume a China Mobile by the end of '16 and the calendar '16. So we think this is going to be kind of the fluctuation that we pointed out would happened as we signed agreements in brought in catch-up. For the year, we came pretty close to the 2.9 longer-term kind of normalize rate we talked about in February at the Analyst Day. I expect we're going to see some continued fluctuations through 17. But structurally and in terms of how we see the future unfolding, I think you can sort of think of that normalized 2.9% as a good longer-term metric. And we do expect next quarter will be up because even if we conclude some additional deals that we're making progress on, the amount of the prior period catch up will be -- will likely be smaller. And then on the end market, really let me try to unpack it in a couple of different ways. We're continuing to see good growth and units. So we're holding our guide for calendar '16, which is about 8% year-over-year growth. And we put out a guide now for '17, which is 7% year-over-year growth. And then the story that we really highlighted maybe 3 years ago is playing out very, very accurately to what we expected. The ASPs have continued to moderate in terms of erosion. And '16 came in about what we called in at the beginning of the about 6% year-over-year erosion. And we expect that to further moderate into fiscal '17. So one of the guidepost we set out in my remarks is if you look at the unit growth and the expected ASP erosion, we think that handset piece of the market in fiscal '17 will grow about mid-single digit. And then of course, on top of that, you have the on handset piece as well as some continued improvement that we expect to drive in compliance, which means we expect to grow the business, the QTL business, at or above the handset growth in the market."

And then I just wanted to talk about that 5% to 11% for this year. Thanks for the color on the '17 number. But IDC and others, IDC, I think just lower their numbers for smartphones from 3% to 1.5% for the year. So you get to the side of 11% range, could you help us out a little bit? Is it more of the non handset stuff in there that's revving a higher? Or do you think there's some misunderstanding about China. And related to that, the QTL long-term goal of $10 billion, I think by fiscal 2020, it sounded like normalized was about 7.2. So maybe just walk us through the unit ASP or new markets that would get us to that longer-term number."

But the was at we've talked about from the announced deals are, I think, basically behind us. In terms of the market. There's -- I think if you look at the way the market has developed throughout the year, a number of industry arrows have been more pessimistic on handset growth than we were at the outset. But at least so far, I would say the market is trending more in line with our view them what they set out. China continues to be strong. And we saw another good quarter in the September quarter of 4G adds. And going forward, we are expecting some pretty meaningful growth in '17 coming from India and Southeast Asia, Middle East. So there's definitely big markets where we see the opportunity for a lot of continued growth. On top of that, we do see a lot of the trends with operators focusing more attention on things like narrowband LTE and more of the industrial and, in addition to consumer launches of IoT devices. So that will be a growth opportunity as well. But it's not -- it's the handset -- underlying hence it growth that we called for '17 mid single-digit, I think, is something we feel very comfortable with. We're not going to update the sort of the $10 billion call that we gave in February. But I guess, what I can say there is in terms of the new agreements that we've signed and the way that the market is playing out between -- since February, there's nothing really that would change the long-term view for the business."

I mean, we've been talking about the trends that we expected to play out in the handset market, like I said, for the last few years. We expected to see some pretty accelerated erosion in ASPs for a couple of years and then start to moderate. But what we are seeing in the emerging markets, although most of the growth going forward is coming from the emerging markets it's the same trends that we've talked about we're continuing to see play out. The Chinese OEMs are continuing to kind of move of tier as they gained share. Cristiano mentioned some of that in response to an earlier question. That's really been good start. A lot of growth in China and in across of the Chinese OEMs even outside of China in the mid-to high tier but that volume does not just coming in at the low tier. And part of that has been driven by the replacement rate story that we expected as people started to to replace their phones and move up tier. We believe those trends are playing out and they'll continue to play out as we go through 2017. And interestingly, if you look at the reported ASP of the business, for fiscal '16, it was down less of then the global. So I mean, even though we're pulling some of the catch-up amounts for prior year period and some of that stuff tended to be at the lower tiers, there's still been some good stability across the ASP picture."

We're not quite there yet. We've got a lot of good progress and certainly, the largest player's done. But were still in negotiations with one more of those. So as I've mentioned in my remarks, yes, we're kind at the 73% mark now, and we need to make some more progress to get closer to the 75%. But I do think that we're on track to get there. And then, from there, we'll have to drive some additional signings and some compliance improvements to get that number up. The 75%, we last give it sort of aligned with around less than 10% global sales that would be on reported. And so -- really not in the position today to guide where we end up in '17 other than to say, we've been making steady progress, and we've got a number of initiatives underway in addition to just negotiating, closing new agreements to drive new compliance in a more favorable picture for us.

In our view of where our roadmap is going, the speed at which of the industry is moving meaning the network that are in the operators, what their plans are to operate the networks, we feel very good about where our modem roadmap and modem business is going. I gave a couple of data points around people launching some of the more advanced, either MIMO or 256 climb networks. We see that happening. We see things like licenses assisted access happening particular the United States being a positive thing. The upgrade to answer to dock 11 a X [ph] and the interconnection or the simultaneous operation between of that and cellular being a good thing. And then just the general pressure on OEMs from other OEMs to use, let's say, things like gigabit class motives we think is creating a positive design win -- good feedback from our customers in terms of how that sets up. So the individual, how that relates to individual model and such and timing of that, I think, is really a better question for the OEMs. But we like where the modem business is headed, particularly as 5G happens and things like narrowband IoT come into the networks as well. So I think that's where we are. Quickly, maybe on the Note 7 and other devices. I think we did comprehend a little bit of impact from that to the forward guide. I think you should think of that as if there's a kind of momentary hold in the market and we have of you as to how that's going to fill in. It may feeling maybe not perhaps in the entire first quarter. But it will fill in, and we feel like we're good -- we're well-positioned for almost any scenario that you can think of performing a lot of different OEMs could feel it in the including just a product transition within the only in that we're talking about.

But also rolled out a series of products across the low mid and high tiers, where we saw much stronger traction in China than we expected going in. So I think, overall, it's a very strong year.

We delivered strong results this quarter with better-than-expected earnings per share, reflecting continued discipline execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We had a very productive year. QCT delivered the improved operating margin target we set last year, and QTL made additional progress on new license agreements in China. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire NXP, an established global leader in industrial-grade computing, security, sensors, RF and networking. The proposed NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy in growth areas with complementary and world-class technology, products, customer relationships and strong sales channels across automotive, IoT, security and networking. 
Our strategy and disciplined execution has put us in an excellent position to maintain our leading position in mobile and strengthen it into the next wave of growth, and we continue to invest in technology leadership. Just as we led each mobile technology transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G/LTE, we are leading the way to 5G. Further, 5G will be the communications fabric for our emerging hyper-connected world. 
In our licensing business, we continue to execute well as we enable the industry to benefit from the tremendous opportunities around the world, including in China. We have now signed license agreements with 9 of the top 10 largest Chinese OEMs according to calendar second quarter 2016 global IDC data. We expect to continue to sign additional licenses with Chinese OEMs and increase the level of compliance throughout fiscal 2017. 
Looking ahead, we are very excited about the future. We have spent the last 30 years interconnecting people. We will spend the next 30 years interconnecting their worlds by building on our mobile technology leadership in advanced computing, connectivity and communication systems. Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies, and our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments.
As evidenced by our fiscal fourth quarter results, we continue to drive operational and financial discipline to execute on our strategy to create a competitive cost structure, and we continue to focus our investments in new growth areas. 
As we've executed this strategy to drive profitable growth, we've maintained our strong balance sheet and commitment to attractive capital returns, returning $6.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year and $21 billion over the last 2 years. We believe we are on a path to build Qualcomm into the semiconductor engine with a connected world.
Turning to our QCT business. We continue to invest to lead the industry. In the premium tier, the Snapdragon 820 is in more than 150 smartphone and tablet designs, including iconic devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 edge, the Xiaomi Mi5 and the LG G5. And this past quarter, we announced the follow-on Snapdragon 821 that was recently launched in Google's Pixel. 
In October, we hosted our annual 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong, where we announced new products in the high and mid-tier segments with the Snapdragon 653, Snapdragon 626 and Snapdragon 427 designed for enhanced experiences and improved connectivity. All 3 processors feature the X9 LTE modem capable of 300 megabits per second on the downlink and 150 megabits per second on the uplink. We continue to extend our modem leadership across tiers and lead the industry to 5G. Our Snapdragon X12 LTE modem, which features such as carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256-QAM modulation, is capable of supporting 600 megabits per second on the downlink. Recently, T-Mobile launched the first 4x4 MIMO technology service with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and has publicly talked about plans for implementing 256-QAM in the near future. SKT and Telstra have launched similar capabilities, and we expect to soon see other operators do the same. 
In February, we announced our Snapdragon X16 modem, capable of Gigabit Class LTE speeds, and we recently announced the world's first Gigabit Class LTE mobile device and gigabit-ready network in collaboration with Telstra, Ericsson and NETGEAR. This modem also includes support for LAA, the global standard for deploying LTE in unlicensed spectrum. The FCC recently began issuing equipment authorizations for LAA, and we received the first. 
We also recently announced our first 5G modem, which will support early 5G trials and deployments. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem is designed to support peak download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second and will initially support 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave spectrum. The first 5G commercial products that will integrate the Snapdragon X50 5G modem are expected to be available during the first half of 2018.
In addition, Qualcomm is accelerating the path to 5G NR, the global 5G standard for a 5G new radio standardized by 3GPP. 5G NR is expected to not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services.
In January, we announced our planned joint venture with TDK to enable delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and IoT. The joint venture will draw upon TDK's capabilities and micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging, and module integration technologies and our expertise in advanced wireless technologies to serve customers with leading-edge RF solutions into fully integrated systems. 
In our adjacent businesses, fiscal 2016 revenues were up more than 40% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto, networking and the addition of the CSR business. For IoT, we are leveraging our leadership in both connectivity and computing to deliver platforms to help accelerate adoption across multiple device types. We now offer over 25 platforms that help manufacturers quickly and cost effectively deliver IoT products, including the Snapdragon VR820 virtual reality reference platform in a suite of connected camera solutions. 
Smartwatches using Snapdragon Wear processors continue to be launched or announced, and drones using our Snapdragon Flight platform are already commercially available in the U.S. and China ahead of the holiday season. 
There is also an increasing trend to use LTE connectivity for IoT. Building off the 100-plus designs we announced in June using the MDM 9x07 LTE modems, we have recent traction among many ecosystem players for the MDM9206 category, M1/MB1 modems featuring a purpose-built design for IoT with lower power consumption and longer-range connectivity than previous LTE generations.
We are broadening distribution of Snapdragon processors with 2 announced parts, the 410E and 600E, available globally by third-party distributors. 
In automotive, we expanded our design win momentum with global automakers across telematics, connectivity and infotainment. We maintained our position as the leading supplier of modems for telematics, benefiting from increased cellular attach rates in cars and the transition to 4G/LTE vehicle solutions. And with the pending addition of the NXP business, we will have the breadth of technology and products that capture even more of the opportunity in these rapidly growing adjacent areas.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a very productive year for Qualcomm. Our strong results this quarter reflect the progress on our strategy and disciplined execution for technology leadership in mobile and new growth areas. We are excited about the future as we continue to build Qualcomm as the semiconductor engine for the connected world.

QTL revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than our prior guidance based on the timing of concluding the key new license agreement in China.
Total reported device sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were also above our prior guidance with reported 3G/4G device shipments at a record 403 million units and ASPs at $184. QTL continues to make good progress in China, both in terms of signing new license agreements and collecting catch-up amounts for prior period sales. 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed new agreements with both vivo and OPPO and recorded catch-up revenues related to prior quarter sales, including a significant amount for prior period 3-mode sales.
The externally implied royalty rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 2.5%, reflecting the impact of the catch-up amounts in the quarter, which included significant royalties from 3-mode device shipments and other device shipments in China. 
In fiscal 2016, QTL revenues were $7.66 billion with total reported device sales of $267.4 billion, reflecting continued handset growth, particularly at Chinese OEMs, and catch-up amounts for prior period sales. The externally implied royalty rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 2.9% as expected. Excluding catch-up amounts related to sales prior to fiscal 2016, the multiyear amortization from the agreement that expired after the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as the acceleration of the license fees for the terminated infrastructure agreement we previously disclosed, we estimate that fiscal year 2016 QTL revenues would have been approximately $7.2 billion. 
We estimate that we collected royalties on approximately 73% of both 3-mode and non-3-mode Chinese OEM global device sales in fiscal 2016. As discussed last quarter, we initiated litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, equally importantly, to prevent Meizu from continuing to compete unfairly against our other licensees that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements with Qualcomm consistent with the resolution we reached with the NDRC.
In June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. And last month, we filed the complaint with the United States ITC, a patent infringement action in Germany and an infringement seizure action in France. 
Regarding the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and are currently in the hearing phase with the commissioners. We have been providing further responses to the case team's report. 
Turning to our expectations for global 3G/4G device shipments. In calendar 2016, we estimate 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices will be shipped, consistent with our prior forecast, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the mid-point. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings, and design momentum continues to drive an increasing percentage of All Mode devices across China.
We estimate that the global ASP for handset shipped during our fiscal 2016 was approximately $185, reflecting an annual decline of approximately 6%, which is in line with our prior forecast. As we expected, the year-over-year handset ASP erosion moderated significantly in fiscal 2016 to approximately half of the rate we experienced during fiscal 2015. 
Looking ahead to calendar 2017, we expect continued year-over-year 3G/4G device shipment growth. We estimate 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices will be shipped during calendar 2017 with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We forecast healthy 3G/4G handset shipment growth to continue in calendar 2017, driven primarily by emerging regions, particularly in India. We expect that the annual erosion in the ASP for handsets shipped during fiscal 2017 will further moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, driving mid-single-digit year-over-year global handset sales growth.
We expect strong growth in 3G/4G-connected IoT device shipments in calendar 2017, driven by the increasing demands of industrial and commercial applications within the smart cities, connected home, wearables and consumer electronics segments. Additionally, several of the world's largest cellular providers are expected to launch commercial operations of scalable, narrowband LTE platforms in the coming year. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and continue to see favorable trends for global 3G/4G device sales. We are focused on concluding additional licensing agreements and improving compliance in fiscal 2017. 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George."

I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered",892,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Our performance was strong in both QTL and QCT relative to expectations. The incremental EPS results that were above the high end of our guidance range were largely driven by the new license agreements and related catch-up payments Derek described, along with stronger-than-expected performance in our investment portfolio. 
In QTL, in addition to the new licenses and related catch-up, stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs also contributed to the above-expectation TRDS results. 
QCT had revenues of $4.1 billion, reflecting MSM shipments modestly above the midpoint of expectations, driven by higher demand in thin modems and from OEMs in China. Revenue per MSM was modestly higher sequentially, primarily due to growth in adjacent businesses. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 3% sequentially, as expected, on cost controls and spending reductions under our Strategic Realignment Plan.
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to stockholders, including approximately $780 million of dividends paid and $225 million in share repurchases. For the full year in 2016, we returned just over 100% of free cash flow to our stockholders and share repurchases of $3.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.
Our goals for fiscal 2016 were designed to improve our cost structure while repositioning the company to capture the next phase of growth. We set 3 primary guidance points for 2016 as a result.
First, we're committed to making significant progress on signing new licenses under the improved terms in China and provided a revenue target range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion for QTL. We executed well on that plan by signing key license agreements with leading Chinese OEMs and delivered approximately $7.66 billion in revenue in the year.
Second, we set an ambitious $1.4 billion spending reduction program, which was comprised of $1.1 billion in savings in operating expenses and engineering costs and COGS and a $300 million reduction in the annual agreement of share-based compensation. The program was fully realized by the end of fiscal 2016. A comparison of the program reductions against the SRP baseline is found on our website in our quarterly investor deck. 
Finally, we targeted to exit fiscal 2016 with a minimum of 16% or better operating margin in QCT for the fourth quarter, which was met, as we reported 16.6% in that quarter.
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.7 billion to $6.5 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.12 to $1.22 per share, down 9% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. 
In QTL, we expect total reported device sales of approximately $58 billion to $66 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 16% sequentially at the midpoint, primarily as a result of the timing of signing new license agreements and related catch-up payments recorded in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
In QCT, we expect approximately 205 million to 225 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 2% sequentially and reflecting seasonally strong demand primarily from OEMs in China across a broad range of products. Share loss at a large thin modem customer is expected to moderate than normally strong seasonal MSM shipments trend in the December quarter. We expect QCT's operating margin percentage to be within approximately 100 basis points of the fourth fiscal quarter. Both of our businesses are seeing a modest impact in their outlook for the quarter as a result of a major customer's product launch challenges.
Turning to 2017. We're providing selective guidance points for the year. We are estimating mid-single-digit percentage growth for global 3G/4G handset sales for fiscal 2017 and 7% growth at the midpoint in calendar year 2017 3G/4G global device shipments, as Derek described.
Consistent with last fiscal year and aligned with our semiconductor and large-cap tech peers, we are not providing fiscal year revenue or earnings per share guidance.
We estimate our non-GAAP fiscal 2017 tax rate to be approximately 18%. As we discussed last week when we announced the proposed acquisition of NXP, we are modifying our capital return program ahead of the expected close of the transaction later in calendar 2017. However, we remain firmly committed to our current dividend program and to continuing to grow our dividend in the future. We are also committed to share repurchases at a level that at least offsets dilution. Depending on the level of stock option exercises by our employees, we could return close to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 2017, as our outstanding stock options have approximately 2 years on average remaining on their lives. We expect to delever quickly after the NXP transaction is closed, providing a strong foundation for future capital returns and enabling us to approach our pre-transaction leverage ratios within 2 years of transaction close.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John."

And then my second question is that, George, you touched a little bit about that -- or your expectation that QCT margin should be within about 100 bps of what you put up for the September quarter -- in the December quarter. But how should we think about QCT margins on more medium- to long-term basis? Are we kind of at a new low? Or is this a new baseline?

I think it also depends on where you're looking in the world. If you look in China, for example, I think the migration to uplink carrier aggregation and the 4G plus has really been helping the business, actually. So I think that's an area where feature leadership in the modem has certainly been able to be highly correlated, actually, with success. But you're right, in some areas, we have seen people either defeature or go with a less advanced modem. Now the way we think about that is that the networks themselves are moving, and that's not a sustainable, long-term position to be in. When we look at teardowns and we look at comparisons between competitors' parts, it's -- the teardowns are very consistent with our view in terms of modem leadership. We are getting feedback from operators that they do want to upgrade their modems, and actually, that includes their end-market devices. The pressure to go to Gigabit Class modems as well as 5G, we think set up a good environment for us. But we do like the position of having modem leadership in the future, and we think we're going to be able to maintain that. We did, as you know, have to make some changes to our cost structure to make sure that we can sustain an environment where maybe that isn't always the case at any particular moment, but we still think that's strong strategic ground to hold."

So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal '17, the externally implied rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2",478,"Rod, this is Derek. So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal '17, the externally implied rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2%. Then this quarter, it swings down to 2.5%. Really, the main driver in this quarter was the amount of catch-up that came in within the quarter. Both -- all of it really coming from Chinese OEMs, a combination of folks reporting under the NDRC terms, but also a significant portion of that under the lower rates that apply to 3-mode. So we think that's largely sort of a historical thing. If you look at the projections for 3-mode in China, they're expected to be below 30% of the volume at China Mobile by the end of '16 -- end of calendar '16. So we think this is just going to be the -- kind of the fluctuation that we pointed out would happen as we signed agreements and brought in catch-up. For the year, we came pretty close to the 2.9% longer-term kind of normalized rate we talked about in February at the Analyst Day. I expect we're going to see some continued fluctuations through '17. But structurally and in terms of how we see the future unfolding, I think you can sort of think of that normalized 2.9% as a good longer-term metric. And we do expect next quarter will be up because even if we conclude some additional deals that we're making progress on, the amount of the prior period catch-up will be -- will likely be smaller. And then on the end market, really, let me try to unpack it a couple of different ways. We're continuing to see good growth in units. So we're holding our guide for calendar '16, which is about 8% year-over-year growth. And we put out a guide now for '17, which is 7% year-over-year growth. And then the story that we really highlighted maybe 3 years ago is playing out very, very accurately to what we expected. The ASPs have continued to moderate in terms of erosion, and '16 came in about where we called it at the beginning of the year, around 6% year-over-year erosion. And we expect that to further moderate into fiscal '17. So one of the guidepost we set out in my remarks is if you look at the unit growth and the expected ASP erosion, we think the handset piece of the market in fiscal '17 will grow about mid-single-digit. And then, of course, on top of that, you have the non-handset piece as well as some continued improvement that we expect to drive in compliance, which means we expect to grow the business, the QTL business, at or above the handset growth in the market."

But IDC and others -- IDC, I think, just lowered their numbers for smartphones from 3% to 1.5% for the year. So to get to this 5% to 11% range, could you help us out a little bit? Is it more of the non-handset stuff and  -- in there that's driving it higher? Do you think there's some misunderstanding about China? And related to that, the QTL long-term goal of $10 billion, I think, by fiscal 2020, it sounded like normalized was about $7.2 billion.

So there's definitely big markets where we see the opportunity for a lot of continued growth. On top of that, we do see a lot of good trends with operators focusing more attention on things like narrowband LTE and more of the industrial and in addition to consumer launches of IoT devices. So that will be a growth opportunity as well, but it's not -- it's -- the handset -- underlying handset growth that we called for '17, mid-single-digit, I think, is something we feel very comfortable with. We're not going to update the sort of the $10 billion call that we gave in February. But I guess, what I can say there is in terms of the new agreements that we've signed and the way that the market is playing out between -- since February, there's nothing really that would change the long-term view for the business."

So on the first question, I don't think -- it's really nothing new. I mean, we've been talking about the trends that we expected to play out in the handset market, like I said, for the last few years. We expected to see some pretty accelerated erosion in ASPs for a couple of years and then start to moderate. But what we are seeing in the emerging markets, although most of the growth going forward is coming from the emerging markets, it's the same trends that we had talked about we're continuing to see play out. The Chinese OEMs are continuing to kind of move up tier as they gained share. Cristiano mentioned some of that in response to an earlier question. That's really been a good story, a lot of growth in China and then across the Chinese OEMs even outside of China in the mid- to high tier. That volume is not just coming in at the low tier. And part of that's been driven by the replacement rate story that we expected as people started to replace their phones and move up tier. We believe those trends are playing out, and they'll continue to play out as we go through 2017. And interestingly, if you look at the reported ASP in the business, for fiscal '16, it was down less than the global. So meaning, even though we're pulling in some of the catch-up amounts for prior period and some of that stuff tended to be at the lower tiers, there's still been some good stability across the ASP picture."

Yes, what I would -- what I meant to say earlier was I think there's maybe points in time where you can get away with not the leading quality or the leading-edge feature set, but I don't think that's good strategic ground to hold. And our view of where our road map is going, the speed at which the industry is moving, meaning the networks that are in the operators, what their plans are to upgrade the networks, we feel very good about where our modem road map and modem business is going. I gave a couple of data points about people launching some of the more advanced, either MIMO or 256-QAM networks. We see that happening. We see things like Licensed Assisted Access happening, particularly in the United States, being a positive thing; the upgrade to 802.11ax and the interconnection or the simultaneous operation between that and cellular being a good thing. And then just the general pressure on OEMs from other OEMs to use, let's say, things like Gigabit Class modems, we think, is creating a positive design win, good feedback from our customers in terms of how that sets up. So the individual -- how that relates to an individual model and such and timing of that, I think, is really a better question for the OEMs. But we like where the modem business is headed, particularly as 5G happens and things like narrowband IoT come in into the networks as well. So I think that's where we are. Quickly, maybe on the Note 7 and other devices, I think we did comprehend a little bit of impact from that in the forward guide. I think you should think of that as if there's a kind of momentary hole in the market, and we have a view as to how that's going to fill in. It may fill in maybe not perhaps in the entire first quarter, but it will fill in. And we feel like we're good -- we're well positioned for almost any scenario that you can think of. I mean, a lot of different OEMs could fill it in, including just a product transition within the OEM that we're talking about. So we feel like we're well positioned in any those scenarios, and we did comprehend some impact of that in the first quarter guide."

That's exactly a differentiating position of QCT. So I think the more that the Chinese customer base export outside China, I think, can actually help our position both within China as well as the growth opportunities.

And it required us to recapture an important slot in the premium tier, which they did, but also rolled out a series of products across the low, mid and high tiers where we saw much stronger traction in China than we expected going in.

We delivered strong results this quarter with better-than-expected earnings per share, reflecting continued discipline execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We had a very productive year. QCT delivered the improved operating margin target we set last year, and QTL made additional progress on new license agreements in China. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire NXP, an established global leader in industrial-grade computing, security, sensors, RF and networking. The proposed NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy in growth areas with complementary and world-class technology, products, customer relationships and strong sales channels across automotive, IoT, security and networking. 
Our strategy and disciplined execution has put us in an excellent position to maintain our leading position in mobile and strengthen it into the next wave of growth, and we continue to invest in technology leadership. Just as we led each mobile technology transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G/LTE, we are leading the way to 5G. Further, 5G will be the communications fabric for our emerging hyper-connected world. 
In our licensing business, we continue to execute well as we enable the industry to benefit from the tremendous opportunities around the world, including in China. We have now signed license agreements with 9 of the top 10 largest Chinese OEMs according to calendar second quarter 2016 global IDC data. We expect to continue to sign additional licenses with Chinese OEMs and increase the level of compliance throughout fiscal 2017. 
Looking ahead, we are very excited about the future. We have spent the last 30 years interconnecting people. We will spend the next 30 years interconnecting their worlds by building on our mobile technology leadership in advanced computing, connectivity and communication systems. Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies, and our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments.
As evidenced by our fiscal fourth quarter results, we continue to drive operational and financial discipline to execute on our strategy to create a competitive cost structure, and we continue to focus our investments in new growth areas. 
As we've executed this strategy to drive profitable growth, we've maintained our strong balance sheet and commitment to attractive capital returns, returning $6.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year and $21 billion over the last 2 years. We believe we are on a path to build Qualcomm into the semiconductor engine with a connected world.
Turning to our QCT business. We continue to invest to lead the industry. In the premium tier, the Snapdragon 820 is in more than 150 smartphone and tablet designs, including iconic devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 edge, the Xiaomi Mi5 and the LG G5. And this past quarter, we announced the follow-on Snapdragon 821 that was recently launched in Google's Pixel. 
In October, we hosted our annual 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong, where we announced new products in the high and mid-tier segments with the Snapdragon 653, Snapdragon 626 and Snapdragon 427 designed for enhanced experiences and improved connectivity. All 3 processors feature the X9 LTE modem capable of 300 megabits per second on the downlink and 150 megabits per second on the uplink. We continue to extend our modem leadership across tiers and lead the industry to 5G. Our Snapdragon X12 LTE modem, which features such as carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256-QAM modulation, is capable of supporting 600 megabits per second on the downlink. Recently, T-Mobile launched the first 4x4 MIMO technology service with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and has publicly talked about plans for implementing 256-QAM in the near future. SKT and Telstra have launched similar capabilities, and we expect to soon see other operators do the same. 
In February, we announced our Snapdragon X16 modem, capable of Gigabit Class LTE speeds, and we recently announced the world's first Gigabit Class LTE mobile device and gigabit-ready network in collaboration with Telstra, Ericsson and NETGEAR. This modem also includes support for LAA, the global standard for deploying LTE in unlicensed spectrum. The FCC recently began issuing equipment authorizations for LAA, and we received the first. 
We also recently announced our first 5G modem, which will support early 5G trials and deployments. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem is designed to support peak download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second and will initially support 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave spectrum. The first 5G commercial products that will integrate the Snapdragon X50 5G modem are expected to be available during the first half of 2018.
In addition, Qualcomm is accelerating the path to 5G NR, the global 5G standard for a 5G new radio standardized by 3GPP. 5G NR is expected to not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services.
In January, we announced our planned joint venture with TDK to enable delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and IoT. The joint venture will draw upon TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging, and module integration technologies and our expertise in advanced wireless technologies to serve customers with leading-edge RF solutions into fully integrated systems. 
In our adjacent businesses, fiscal 2016 revenues were up more than 40% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto, networking and the addition of the CSR business. For IoT, we are leveraging our leadership in both connectivity and computing to deliver platforms to help accelerate adoption across multiple device types. We now offer over 25 platforms that help manufacturers quickly and cost effectively deliver IoT products, including the Snapdragon VR820 virtual reality reference platform and a suite of connected camera solutions. 
Smartwatches using Snapdragon Wear processors continue to be launched or announced, and drones using our Snapdragon Flight platform are already commercially available in the U.S. and China ahead of the holiday season. 
There is also an increasing trend to use LTE connectivity for IoT. Building off the 100-plus designs we announced in June using the MDM 9x07 LTE modems, we have recent traction among many ecosystem players for the MDM9206 category, M1/MB1 modems featuring a purpose-built design for IoT with lower power consumption and longer-range connectivity than previous LTE generations.
We are broadening distribution of Snapdragon processors with 2 announced parts, the 410E and 600E, available globally by third-party distributors. 
In automotive, we expanded our design win momentum with global automakers across telematics, connectivity and infotainment. We maintained our position as the leading supplier of modems for telematics, benefiting from increased cellular attach rates in cars and the transition to 4G/LTE vehicle solutions. And with the pending addition of the NXP business, we will have the breadth of technology and products that capture even more of the opportunity in these rapidly growing adjacent areas.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a very productive year for Qualcomm. Our strong results this quarter reflect the progress on our strategy and disciplined execution for technology leadership in mobile and new growth areas. We are excited about the future as we continue to build Qualcomm as the semiconductor engine for the connected world. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek."

As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion and total reported device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of key license agreements in China as",787,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion and total reported device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of key license agreements in China as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs. QTL revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than our prior guidance based on the timing of concluding the key new license agreement in China.
Total reported device sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were also above our prior guidance with reported 3G/4G device shipments at a record 403 million units and ASPs at $184. QTL continues to make good progress in China, both in terms of signing new license agreements and collecting catch-up amounts for prior period sales. 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed new agreements with both vivo and OPPO and recorded catch-up revenues related to prior quarter sales, including a significant amount for prior period 3-mode sales.
The externally implied royalty rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 2.5%, reflecting the impact of the catch-up amounts in the quarter, which included significant royalties from 3-mode device shipments and other device shipments in China. 
In fiscal 2016, QTL revenues were $7.66 billion with total reported device sales of $267.4 billion, reflecting continued handset growth, particularly at Chinese OEMs, and catch-up amounts for prior period sales. The externally implied royalty rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 2.9% as expected. Excluding catch-up amounts related to sales prior to fiscal 2016, the multiyear amortization from the agreement that expired after the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as the acceleration of the license fees for the terminated infrastructure agreement we previously disclosed, we estimate that fiscal year 2016 QTL revenues would have been approximately $7.2 billion. 
We estimate that we collected royalties on approximately 73% of both 3-mode and non-3-mode Chinese OEM global device sales in fiscal 2016. As discussed last quarter, we initiated litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, equally importantly, to prevent Meizu from continuing to compete unfairly against our other licensees that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements with Qualcomm consistent with the resolution we reached with the NDRC.
In June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. And last month, we filed the complaint with the United States ITC, a patent infringement action in Germany and an infringement seizure action in France. 
Regarding the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and are currently in the hearing phase with the commissioners. We have been providing further responses to the case team's report. 
Turning to our expectations for global 3G/4G device shipments. In calendar 2016, we estimate 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices will be shipped, consistent with our prior forecast, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the mid-point. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings, and design momentum continues to drive an increasing percentage of All Mode devices across China.
We estimate that the global ASP for handset shipped during our fiscal 2016 was approximately $185, reflecting an annual decline of approximately 6%, which is in line with our prior forecast. As we expected, the year-over-year handset ASP erosion moderated significantly in fiscal 2016 to approximately half of the rate we experienced during fiscal 2015. 
Looking ahead to calendar 2017, we expect continued year-over-year 3G/4G device shipment growth. We estimate 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices will be shipped during calendar 2017 with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We forecast healthy 3G/4G handset shipment growth to continue in calendar 2017, driven primarily by emerging regions, particularly in India. We expect that the annual erosion in the ASP for handsets shipped during fiscal 2017 will further moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, driving mid-single-digit year-over-year global handset sales growth.
We expect strong growth in 3G/4G-connected IoT device shipments in calendar 2017, driven by the increasing demands of industrial and commercial applications within the smart cities, connected home, wearables and consumer electronics segments. Additionally, several of the world's largest cellular providers are expected to launch commercial operations of scalable, narrowband LTE platforms in the coming year. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and continue to see favorable trends for global 3G/4G device sales. We are focused on concluding additional licensing agreements and improving compliance in fiscal 2017. 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George."

I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered",892,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Our performance was strong in both QTL and QCT relative to expectations. The incremental EPS results that were above the high end of our guidance range were largely driven by the new license agreements and related catch-up payments Derek described, along with stronger-than-expected performance in our investment portfolio. 
In QTL, in addition to the new licenses and related catch-up, stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs also contributed to the above-expectation TRDS results. 
QCT had revenues of $4.1 billion, reflecting MSM shipments modestly above the midpoint of expectations, driven by higher demand in thin modems and from OEMs in China. Revenue per MSM was modestly higher sequentially, primarily due to growth in adjacent businesses. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 3% sequentially, as expected, on cost controls and spending reductions under our Strategic Realignment Plan.
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to stockholders, including approximately $780 million of dividends paid and $225 million in share repurchases. For the full year in 2016, we returned just over 100% of free cash flow to our stockholders on share repurchases of $3.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.
Our goals for fiscal 2016 were designed to improve our cost structure while repositioning the company to capture the next phase of growth. We set 3 primary guidance points for 2016 as a result.
First, we're committed to making significant progress on signing new licenses under the approved terms in China and provided a revenue target range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion for QTL. We executed well on that plan by signing key license agreements with leading Chinese OEMs and delivered approximately $7.66 billion in revenue in the year.
Second, we set an ambitious $1.4 billion spending reduction program, which was comprised of $1.1 billion in savings in operating expenses and engineering costs in COGS and a $300 million reduction in the annual grant of share-based compensation. The program was fully realized by the end of fiscal 2016. A comparison of the program reductions against the SRP baseline is found on our website in our quarterly investor deck. 
Finally, we targeted to exit fiscal 2016 with a minimum of 16% or better operating margin in QCT for the fourth quarter, which was met, as we reported 16.6% in that quarter.
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.7 billion to $6.5 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.12 to $1.22 per share, down 9% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. 
In QTL, we expect total reported device sales of approximately $58 billion to $66 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 16% sequentially at the midpoint, primarily as a result of the timing of signing new license agreements and related catch-up payments recorded in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
In QCT, we expect approximately 205 million to 225 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 2% sequentially and reflecting seasonally strong demand primarily from OEMs in China across a broad range of products. Share loss at a large thin modem customer is expected to moderate the normally strong seasonal MSM shipments trend in the December quarter. We expect QCT's operating margin percentage to be within approximately 100 basis points of the fourth fiscal quarter. Both of our businesses are seeing a modest impact in their outlook for the quarter as a result of a major customer's product launch challenges.
Turning to 2017. We're providing selective guidance points for the year. We are estimating mid-single-digit percentage growth for global 3G/4G handset sales for fiscal 2017 and 7% growth at the midpoint in calendar year 2017 3G/4G global device shipments, as Derek described.
Consistent with last fiscal year and aligned with our semiconductor and large-cap tech peers, we are not providing fiscal year revenue or earnings per share guidance.
We estimate our non-GAAP fiscal 2017 tax rate to be approximately 18%. As we discussed last week when we announced the proposed acquisition of NXP, we are modifying our capital return program ahead of the expected close of the transaction later in calendar 2017. However, we remain firmly committed to our current dividend program and to continuing to grow our dividend in the future. We are also committed to share repurchases at a level that at least offsets dilution. Depending on the level of stock option exercises by our employees, we could return close to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 2017, as our outstanding stock options have approximately 2 years on average remaining on their lives. We expect to delever quickly after the NXP transaction is closed, providing a strong foundation for future capital returns and enabling us to approach our pre-transaction leverage ratios within 2 years of transaction close.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John."

And then my second question is that, George, you touched a little bit about that -- or your expectation that QCT margin should be within about 100 bps of what you put up for the September quarter -- in the December quarter. But how should we think about QCT margins on more medium- to long-term basis? Are we kind of at a new low? Or is this a new baseline?

I think it also depends on where you're looking in the world. If you look in China, for example, I think the migration to uplink carrier aggregation in the 4G plus has really been helping the business, actually. So I think that's an area where feature leadership in the modem has certainly been able to be highly correlated, actually, with success. But you're right, in some areas, we have seen people either defeature or go with a less advanced modem. Now the way we think about that is that the networks themselves are moving, and that's not a sustainable, long-term position to be in. When we look at teardowns and we look at comparisons between competitors' parts, it's -- the teardowns are very consistent with our view in terms of modem leadership. We are getting feedback from operators that they do want to upgrade their modems, and actually, that includes their end-market devices. The pressure to go to Gigabit Class modems as well as 5G, we think set up a good environment for us. But we do like the position of having modem leadership in the future, and we think we're going to be able to maintain that. We did, as you know, have to make some changes to our cost structure to make sure that we can sustain an environment where maybe that isn't always the case at any particular moment, but we still think that's strong strategic ground to hold."

So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal '17, the externally implied rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2",478,"Rod, this is Derek. So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal '17, the externally implied rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2%. Then this quarter, it swings down to 2.5%. Really, the main driver in this quarter was the amount of catch-up that came in within the quarter. Both -- all of it really coming from Chinese OEMs, a combination of folks reporting under the NDRC terms, but also a significant portion of that under the lower rates that apply to 3-mode. So we think that's largely sort of a historical thing. If you look at the projections for 3-mode in China, they're expected to be below 30% of the volume at China Mobile by the end of '16 -- end of calendar '16. So we think this is just going to be the -- kind of the fluctuation that we pointed out would happen as we signed agreements and brought in catch-up. For the year, we came pretty close to the 2.9% longer-term kind of normalized rate we talked about in February at the Analyst Day. I expect we're going to see some continued fluctuations through '17. But structurally and in terms of how we see the future unfolding, I think you can sort of think of that normalized 2.9% as a good longer-term metric. And we do expect next quarter will be up because even if we conclude some additional deals that we're making progress on, the amount of the prior period catch-up will be -- will likely be smaller. And then on the end market, really, let me try to unpack it a couple of different ways. We're continuing to see good growth in units. So we're holding our guide for calendar '16, which is about 8% year-over-year growth. And we put out a guide now for '17, which is 7% year-over-year growth. And then the story that we really highlighted maybe 3 years ago is playing out very, very accurately to what we expected. The ASPs have continued to moderate in terms of erosion, and '16 came in about where we called it at the beginning of the year, around 6% year-over-year erosion. And we expect that to further moderate into fiscal '17. So one of the guidepost we set out in my remarks is if you look at the unit growth and the expected ASP erosion, we think the handset piece of the market in fiscal '17 will grow about mid-single-digit. And then, of course, on top of that, you have the non-handset piece as well as some continued improvement that we expect to drive in compliance, which means we expect to grow the business, the QTL business, at or above the handset growth in the market."

And then I just wanted to talk about that 5% to 11% for this year. Thanks for the color on the '17 number. But IDC and others -- IDC, I think, just lowered their numbers for smartphones from 3% to 1.5% for the year. So to get to this 5% to 11% range, could you help us out a little bit? Is it more of the non-handset stuff and -- in there that's driving it higher? Do you think there's some misunderstanding about China? And related to that, the QTL long-term goal of $10 billion, I think, by fiscal 2020, it sounded like normalized was about $7.2 billion. So maybe just walk us through the unit ASP or new markets that would get us to that longer-term number."

Yes, the catch-up that came in over the last 2 quarters related to the signing of new deals, that's basically largely baked and behind us. We have signed 9 of the top 10 Chinese OEMs now, so great progress throughout the year. We do have another one that we're continuing to negotiate with and continue to make progress as well as, as we've noted, the litigation against Meizu, which, we're hopeful, will drive to an agreement at some point. So there will be some continued fluctuation in the revenue in QTL based on catch-up both on combination of new deals as well as driving compliance resolutions. But the ones that we've talked about from the announced deals are, I think, basically behind us. In terms of the market, there's -- I think if you look at the way the market has developed throughout the year, a number of industry analysts have been more pessimistic on handset growth than we were at the outset. But at least, so far, I would say the market's trending more in line with our view than what they set out. China continues to be strong, and we saw another good quarter in the September quarter of 4G adds. And going forward, we're expecting some pretty meaningful growth in '17 coming from India and Southeast Asia, Middle East. So there's definitely big markets where we see the opportunity for a lot of continued growth. On top of that, we do see a lot of good trends with operators focusing more attention on things like narrowband LTE and more of the industrial and in addition to consumer launches of IoT devices. So that will be a growth opportunity as well, but it's not -- it's -- the handset -- underlying handset growth that we called for '17, mid-single-digit, I think, is something we feel very comfortable with. We're not going to update the sort of the $10 billion call that we gave in February. But I guess, what I can say there is in terms of the new agreements that we've signed and the way that the market is playing out between -- since February, there's nothing really that would change the long-term view for the business."

I mean, we've been talking about the trends that we expected to play out in the handset market, like I said, for the last few years. We expected to see some pretty accelerated erosion in ASPs for a couple of years and then start to moderate. But what we are seeing in the emerging markets, although most of the growth going forward is coming from the emerging markets, it's the same trends that we had talked about we're continuing to see play out. The Chinese OEMs are continuing to kind of move up tier as they gained share. Cristiano mentioned some of that in response to an earlier question. That's really been a good story, a lot of growth in China and then across the Chinese OEMs even outside of China in the mid- to high tier. That volume is not just coming in at the low tier. And part of that's been driven by the replacement rate story that we expected as people started to replace their phones and move up tier. We believe those trends are playing out, and they'll continue to play out as we go through 2017. And interestingly, if you look at the reported ASP in the business, for fiscal '16, it was down less than the global. So meaning, even though we're pulling in some of the catch-up amounts for prior period and some of that stuff tended to be at the lower tiers, there's still been some good stability across the ASP picture."

And then from there, we'll have to drive some additional signings and some compliance improvements to get that number up. The 75% that we last gave, it's sort of aligned with around a little less than 10% global sales that would be unreported. And so we don't -- I'm really not in a position today to guide where we end up in '17 other than to say we've been making steady progress, and we've got a number of initiatives under way in addition to just negotiating, closing new agreements to drive the compliance in a more favorable picture for us.

Yes, what I would -- what I meant to say earlier was I think there's maybe points in time where you can get away with not the leading quality or the leading-edge feature set, but I don't think that's good strategic ground to hold. And our view of where our road map is going, the speed at which the industry is moving, meaning the networks that are in the operators, what their plans are to upgrade the networks, we feel very good about where our modem road map and modem business is going. I gave a couple of data points about people launching some of the more advanced, either MIMO or 256-QAM networks. We see that happening. We see things like Licensed Assisted Access happening, particularly in the United States, being a positive thing; the upgrade to 802.11ax and the interconnection or the simultaneous operation between that and cellular being a good thing. And then just the general pressure on OEMs from other OEMs to use, let's say, things like Gigabit Class modems, we think, is creating a positive design win, good feedback from our customers in terms of how that sets up. So the individual -- how that relates to an individual model and such and timing of that, I think, is really a better question for the OEMs. But we like where the modem business is headed, particularly as 5G happens and things like narrowband IoT come in into the networks as well. So I think that's where we are. Quickly, maybe on the Note 7 and other devices, I think we did comprehend a little bit of impact from that in the forward guide. I think you should think of that as if there's a kind of momentary hole in the market, and we have a view as to how that's going to fill in. It may fill in maybe not perhaps in the entire first quarter, but it will fill in. And we feel like we're good -- we're well positioned for almost any scenario that you can think of. I mean, a lot of different OEMs could fill it in, including just a product transition within the OEM that we're talking about. So we feel like we're well positioned in any those scenarios, and we did comprehend some impact of that in the first quarter guide."

And it required us to recapture an important slot in the premium tier, which they did, but also rolled out a series of products across the low, mid and high tiers where we saw much stronger traction in China than we expected going in.

We delivered strong results this quarter with better-than-expected earnings per share, reflecting continued discipline execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We had a very productive year. QCT deliv",1206,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter with better-than-expected earnings per share, reflecting continued discipline execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We had a very productive year. QCT delivered the improved operating margin target we set last year, and QTL made additional progress on new license agreements in China. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire NXP, an established global leader in industrial-grade computing, security, sensors, RF and networking. The proposed NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy in growth areas with complementary and world-class technology, products, customer relationships and strong sales channels across automotive, IoT, security and networking. 
Our strategy and disciplined execution has put us in an excellent position to maintain our leading position in mobile and strengthen it into the next wave of growth, and we continue to invest in technology leadership. Just as we led each mobile technology transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G/LTE, we are leading the way to 5G. Further, 5G will be the communications fabric for our emerging hyper-connected world. 
In our licensing business, we continue to execute well as we enable the industry to benefit from the tremendous opportunities around the world, including in China. We have now signed license agreements with 9 of the top 10 largest Chinese OEMs according to calendar second quarter 2016 global IDC data. We expect to continue to sign additional licenses with Chinese OEMs and increase the level of compliance throughout fiscal 2017. 
Looking ahead, we are very excited about the future. We have spent the last 30 years interconnecting people. We will spend the next 30 years interconnecting their worlds by building on our mobile technology leadership in advanced computing, connectivity and communication systems. Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies, and our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments.
As evidenced by our fiscal fourth quarter results, we continue to drive operational and financial discipline to execute on our strategy to create a competitive cost structure, and we continue to focus our investments in new growth areas. 
As we've executed this strategy to drive profitable growth, we've maintained our strong balance sheet and commitment to attractive capital returns, returning $6.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year and $21 billion over the last 2 years. We believe we are on a path to build Qualcomm into the semiconductor engine with a connected world.
Turning to our QCT business. We continue to invest to lead the industry. In the premium tier, the Snapdragon 820 is in more than 150 smartphone and tablet designs, including iconic devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 edge, the Xiaomi Mi5 and the LG G5. And this past quarter, we announced the follow-on Snapdragon 821 that was recently launched in Google's Pixel. 
In October, we hosted our annual 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong, where we announced new products in the high and mid-tier segments with the Snapdragon 653, Snapdragon 626 and Snapdragon 427 designed for enhanced experiences and improved connectivity. All 3 processors feature the X9 LTE modem capable of 300 megabits per second on the downlink and 150 megabits per second on the uplink. We continue to extend our modem leadership across tiers and lead the industry to 5G. Our Snapdragon X12 LTE modem, which features such as carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256-QAM modulation, is capable of supporting 600 megabits per second on the downlink. Recently, T-Mobile launched the first 4x4 MIMO technology service with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and has publicly talked about plans for implementing 256-QAM in the near future. SKT and Telstra have launched similar capabilities, and we expect to soon see other operators do the same. 
In February, we announced our Snapdragon X16 modem, capable of Gigabit Class LTE speeds, and we recently announced the world's first Gigabit Class LTE mobile device and gigabit-ready network in collaboration with Telstra, Ericsson and NETGEAR. This modem also includes support for LAA, the global standard for deploying LTE in unlicensed spectrum. The FCC recently began issuing equipment authorizations for LAA, and we received the first. 
We also recently announced our first 5G modem, which will support early 5G trials and deployments. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem is designed to support peak download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second and will initially support 28 gigahertz millimeter-wave spectrum. The first 5G commercial products that will integrate the Snapdragon X50 5G modem are expected to be available during the first half of 2018.
In addition, Qualcomm is accelerating the path to 5G NR, the global 5G standard for a 5G new radio standardized by 3GPP. 5G NR is expected to not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services.
In January, we announced our planned joint venture with TDK to enable delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and IoT. The joint venture will draw upon TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging, and module integration technologies and our expertise in advanced wireless technologies to serve customers with leading-edge RF solutions into fully integrated systems. 
In our adjacent businesses, fiscal 2016 revenues were up more than 40% year-over-year, driven by growth in auto, networking and the addition of the CSR business. For IoT, we are leveraging our leadership in both connectivity and computing to deliver platforms to help accelerate adoption across multiple device types. We now offer over 25 platforms that help manufacturers quickly and cost effectively deliver IoT products, including the Snapdragon VR820 virtual reality reference platform and a suite of connected camera solutions. 
Smartwatches using Snapdragon Wear processors continue to be launched or announced, and drones using our Snapdragon Flight platform are already commercially available in the U.S. and China ahead of the holiday season. 
There is also an increasing trend to use LTE connectivity for IoT. Building off the 100-plus designs we announced in June using the MDM 9x07 LTE modems, we have recent traction among many ecosystem players for the MDM9206 category, M1/MB1 modems featuring a purpose-built design for IoT with lower power consumption and longer-range connectivity than previous LTE generations.
We are broadening distribution of Snapdragon processors with 2 announced parts, the 410E and 600E, available globally by third-party distributors. 
In automotive, we expanded our design win momentum with global automakers across telematics, connectivity and infotainment. We maintained our position as the leading supplier of modems for telematics, benefiting from increased cellular attach rates in cars and the transition to 4G/LTE vehicle solutions. And with the pending addition of the NXP business, we will have the breadth of technology and products that capture even more of the opportunity in these rapidly growing adjacent areas.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a very productive year for Qualcomm. Our strong results this quarter reflect the progress on our strategy and disciplined execution for technology leadership in mobile and new growth areas. We are excited about the future as we continue to build Qualcomm as the semiconductor engine for the connected world. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek."

As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion and total reported device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of key license agreements in China as",787,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion and total reported device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of key license agreements in China as well as stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs. QTL revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than our prior guidance based on the timing of concluding the key new license agreement in China.
Total reported device sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were also above our prior guidance with reported 3G/4G device shipments at a record 403 million units and ASPs at $184. QTL continues to make good progress in China, both in terms of signing new license agreements and collecting catch-up amounts for prior period sales. 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed new agreements with both vivo and OPPO and recorded catch-up revenues related to prior quarter sales, including a significant amount for prior period 3-mode sales.
The externally implied royalty rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 2.5%, reflecting the impact of the catch-up amounts in the quarter, which included significant royalties from 3-mode device shipments and other device shipments in China. 
In fiscal 2016, QTL revenues were $7.66 billion with total reported device sales of $267.4 billion, reflecting continued handset growth, particularly at Chinese OEMs, and catch-up amounts for prior period sales. The externally implied royalty rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 2.9% as expected. Excluding catch-up amounts related to sales prior to fiscal 2016, the multiyear amortization from the agreement that expired after the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as the acceleration of the license fees for the terminated infrastructure agreement we previously disclosed, we estimate that fiscal year 2016 QTL revenues would have been approximately $7.2 billion. 
We estimate that we collected royalties on approximately 73% of both 3-mode and non-3-mode Chinese OEM global device sales in fiscal 2016. As discussed last quarter, we initiated litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and, equally importantly, to prevent Meizu from continuing to compete unfairly against our other licensees that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements with Qualcomm consistent with the resolution we reached with the NDRC.
In June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. And last month, we filed the complaint with the United States ITC, a patent infringement action in Germany and an infringement seizure action in France. 
Regarding the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and are currently in the hearing phase with the commissioners. We have been providing further responses to the case team's report. 
Turning to our expectations for global 3G/4G device shipments. In calendar 2016, we estimate 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices will be shipped, consistent with our prior forecast, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the mid-point. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings, and design momentum continues to drive an increasing percentage of All Mode devices across China.
We estimate that the global ASP for handset shipped during our fiscal 2016 was approximately $185, reflecting an annual decline of approximately 6%, which is in line with our prior forecast. As we expected, the year-over-year handset ASP erosion moderated significantly in fiscal 2016 to approximately half of the rate we experienced during fiscal 2015. 
Looking ahead to calendar 2017, we expect continued year-over-year 3G/4G device shipment growth. We estimate 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices will be shipped during calendar 2017 with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We forecast healthy 3G/4G handset shipment growth to continue in calendar 2017, driven primarily by emerging regions, particularly in India. We expect that the annual erosion in the ASP for handsets shipped during fiscal 2017 will further moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, driving mid-single-digit year-over-year global handset sales growth.
We expect strong growth in 3G/4G-connected IoT device shipments in calendar 2017, driven by the increasing demands of industrial and commercial applications within the smart cities, connected home, wearables and consumer electronics segments. Additionally, several of the world's largest cellular providers are expected to launch commercial operations of scalable, narrowband LTE platforms in the coming year. 
To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and continue to see favorable trends for global 3G/4G device sales. We are focused on concluding additional licensing agreements and improving compliance in fiscal 2017. 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George."

I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered",892,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Our performance was strong in both QTL and QCT relative to expectations. The incremental EPS results that were above the high end of our guidance range were largely driven by the new license agreements and related catch-up payments Derek described, along with stronger-than-expected performance in our investment portfolio. 
In QTL, in addition to the new licenses and related catch-up, stronger-than-expected 3G/4G device ASPs also contributed to the above-expectation TRDS results. 
QCT had revenues of $4.1 billion, reflecting MSM shipments modestly above the midpoint of expectations, driven by higher demand in thin modems and from OEMs in China. Revenue per MSM was modestly higher sequentially, primarily due to growth in adjacent businesses. 
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 3% sequentially, as expected, on cost controls and spending reductions under our Strategic Realignment Plan.
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to stockholders, including approximately $780 million of dividends paid and $225 million in share repurchases. For the full year in 2016, we returned just over 100% of free cash flow to our stockholders on share repurchases of $3.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.
Our goals for fiscal 2016 were designed to improve our cost structure while repositioning the company to capture the next phase of growth. We set 3 primary guidance points for 2016 as a result.
First, we're committed to making significant progress on signing new licenses under the approved terms in China and provided a revenue target range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion for QTL. We executed well on that plan by signing key license agreements with leading Chinese OEMs and delivered approximately $7.66 billion in revenue in the year.
Second, we set an ambitious $1.4 billion spending reduction program, which was comprised of $1.1 billion in savings in operating expenses and engineering costs in COGS and a $300 million reduction in the annual grant of share-based compensation. The program was fully realized by the end of fiscal 2016. A comparison of the program reductions against the SRP baseline is found on our website in our quarterly investor deck. 
Finally, we targeted to exit fiscal 2016 with a minimum of 16% or better operating margin in QCT for the fourth quarter, which was met, as we reported 16.6% in that quarter.
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.7 billion to $6.5 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.12 to $1.22 per share, down 9% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. 
In QTL, we expect total reported device sales of approximately $58 billion to $66 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 16% sequentially at the midpoint, primarily as a result of the timing of signing new license agreements and related catch-up payments recorded in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
In QCT, we expect approximately 205 million to 225 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 2% sequentially and reflecting seasonally strong demand primarily from OEMs in China across a broad range of products. Share loss at a large thin modem customer is expected to moderate the normally strong seasonal MSM shipments trend in the December quarter. We expect QCT's operating margin percentage to be within approximately 100 basis points of the fourth fiscal quarter. Both of our businesses are seeing a modest impact in their outlook for the quarter as a result of a major customer's product launch challenges.
Turning to 2017. We're providing selective guidance points for the year. We are estimating mid-single-digit percentage growth for global 3G/4G handset sales for fiscal 2017 and 7% growth at the midpoint in calendar year 2017 3G/4G global device shipments, as Derek described.
Consistent with last fiscal year and aligned with our semiconductor and large-cap tech peers, we are not providing fiscal year revenue or earnings per share guidance.
We estimate our non-GAAP fiscal 2017 tax rate to be approximately 18%. As we discussed last week when we announced the proposed acquisition of NXP, we are modifying our capital return program ahead of the expected close of the transaction later in calendar 2017. However, we remain firmly committed to our current dividend program and to continuing to grow our dividend in the future. We are also committed to share repurchases at a level that at least offsets dilution. Depending on the level of stock option exercises by our employees, we could return close to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 2017, as our outstanding stock options have approximately 2 years on average remaining on their lives. We expect to delever quickly after the NXP transaction is closed, providing a strong foundation for future capital returns and enabling us to approach our pre-transaction leverage ratios within 2 years of transaction close.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John."

And then my second question is that, George, you touched a little bit about that -- or your expectation that QCT margin should be within about 100 bps of what you put up for the September quarter -- in the December quarter. But how should we think about QCT margins on more medium- to long-term basis? Are we kind of at a new low? Or is this a new baseline?

I think it also depends on where you're looking in the world. If you look in China, for example, I think the migration to uplink carrier aggregation in the 4G plus has really been helping the business, actually. So I think that's an area where feature leadership in the modem has certainly been able to be highly correlated, actually, with success. But you're right, in some areas, we have seen people either defeature or go with a less advanced modem. Now the way we think about that is that the networks themselves are moving, and that's not a sustainable, long-term position to be in. When we look at teardowns and we look at comparisons between competitors' parts, it's -- the teardowns are very consistent with our view in terms of modem leadership. We are getting feedback from operators that they do want to upgrade their modems, and actually, that includes their end-market devices. The pressure to go to Gigabit Class modems as well as 5G, we think set up a good environment for us. But we do like the position of having modem leadership in the future, and we think we're going to be able to maintain that. We did, as you know, have to make some changes to our cost structure to make sure that we can sustain an environment where maybe that isn't always the case at any particular moment, but we still think that's strong strategic ground to hold."

If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2",478,"Rod, this is Derek. So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal '17, the externally implied rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2%. Then this quarter, it swings down to 2.5%. Really, the main driver in this quarter was the amount of catch-up that came in within the quarter. Both -- all of it really coming from Chinese OEMs, a combination of folks reporting under the NDRC terms, but also a significant portion of that under the lower rates that apply to 3-mode. So we think that's largely sort of a historical thing. If you look at the projections for 3-mode in China, they're expected to be below 30% of the volume at China Mobile by the end of '16 -- end of calendar '16. So we think this is just going to be the -- kind of the fluctuation that we pointed out would happen as we signed agreements and brought in catch-up. For the year, we came pretty close to the 2.9% longer-term kind of normalized rate we talked about in February at the Analyst Day. I expect we're going to see some continued fluctuations through '17. But structurally and in terms of how we see the future unfolding, I think you can sort of think of that normalized 2.9% as a good longer-term metric. And we do expect next quarter will be up because even if we conclude some additional deals that we're making progress on, the amount of the prior period catch-up will be -- will likely be smaller. And then on the end market, really, let me try to unpack it a couple of different ways. We're continuing to see good growth in units. So we're holding our guide for calendar '16, which is about 8% year-over-year growth. And we put out a guide now for '17, which is 7% year-over-year growth. And then the story that we really highlighted maybe 3 years ago is playing out very, very accurately to what we expected. The ASPs have continued to moderate in terms of erosion, and '16 came in about where we called it at the beginning of the year, around 6% year-over-year erosion. And we expect that to further moderate into fiscal '17. So one of the guidepost we set out in my remarks is if you look at the unit growth and the expected ASP erosion, we think the handset piece of the market in fiscal '17 will grow about mid-single-digit. And then, of course, on top of that, you have the non-handset piece as well as some continued improvement that we expect to drive in compliance, which means we expect to grow the business, the QTL business, at or above the handset growth in the market."

But IDC and others -- IDC, I think, just lowered their numbers for smartphones from 3% to 1.5% for the year. So to get to this 5% to 11% range, could you help us out a little bit? Is it more of the non-handset stuff and -- in there that's driving it higher? Do you think there's some misunderstanding about China? And related to that, the QTL long-term goal of $10 billion, I think, by fiscal 2020, it sounded like normalized was about $7.2 billion. So maybe just walk us through the unit ASP or new markets that would get us to that longer-term number."

We do have another one that we're continuing to negotiate with and continue to make progress as well as, as we've noted, the litigation against Meizu, which, we're hopeful, will drive to an agreement at some point. So there will be some continued fluctuation in the revenue in QTL based on catch-up both on combination of new deals as well as driving compliance resolutions. But the ones that we've talked about from the announced deals are, I think, basically behind us. In terms of the market, there's -- I think if you look at the way the market has developed throughout the year, a number of industry analysts have been more pessimistic on handset growth than we were at the outset. But at least, so far, I would say the market's trending more in line with our view than what they set out. China continues to be strong, and we saw another good quarter in the September quarter of 4G adds. And going forward, we're expecting some pretty meaningful growth in '17 coming from India and Southeast Asia, Middle East. So there's definitely big markets where we see the opportunity for a lot of continued growth. On top of that, we do see a lot of good trends with operators focusing more attention on things like narrowband LTE and more of the industrial and in addition to consumer launches of IoT devices. So that will be a growth opportunity as well, but it's not -- it's -- the handset -- underlying handset growth that we called for '17, mid-single-digit, I think, is something we feel very comfortable with. We're not going to update the sort of the $10 billion call that we gave in February. But I guess, what I can say there is in terms of the new agreements that we've signed and the way that the market is playing out between -- since February, there's nothing really that would change the long-term view for the business."

I mean, we've been talking about the trends that we expected to play out in the handset market, like I said, for the last few years. We expected to see some pretty accelerated erosion in ASPs for a couple of years and then start to moderate. But what we are seeing in the emerging markets, although most of the growth going forward is coming from the emerging markets, it's the same trends that we had talked about we're continuing to see play out. The Chinese OEMs are continuing to kind of move up tier as they gained share. Cristiano mentioned some of that in response to an earlier question. That's really been a good story, a lot of growth in China and then across the Chinese OEMs even outside of China in the mid- to high tier. That volume is not just coming in at the low tier. And part of that's been driven by the replacement rate story that we expected as people started to replace their phones and move up tier. We believe those trends are playing out, and they'll continue to play out as we go through 2017. And interestingly, if you look at the reported ASP in the business, for fiscal '16, it was down less than the global. So meaning, even though we're pulling in some of the catch-up amounts for prior period and some of that stuff tended to be at the lower tiers, there's still been some good stability across the ASP picture."

And our view of where our road map is going, the speed at which the industry is moving, meaning the networks that are in the operators, what their plans are to upgrade the networks, we feel very good about where our modem road map and modem business is going. I gave a couple of data points about people launching some of the more advanced, either MIMO or 256-QAM networks. We see that happening. We see things like Licensed Assisted Access happening, particularly in the United States, being a positive thing; the upgrade to 802.11ax and the interconnection or the simultaneous operation between that and cellular being a good thing. And then just the general pressure on OEMs from other OEMs to use, let's say, things like Gigabit Class modems, we think, is creating a positive design win, good feedback from our customers in terms of how that sets up. So the individual -- how that relates to an individual model and such and timing of that, I think, is really a better question for the OEMs. But we like where the modem business is headed, particularly as 5G happens and things like narrowband IoT come in into the networks as well. So I think that's where we are. Quickly, maybe on the Note 7 and other devices, I think we did comprehend a little bit of impact from that in the forward guide. I think you should think of that as if there's a kind of momentary hole in the market, and we have a view as to how that's going to fill in. It may fill in maybe not perhaps in the entire first quarter, but it will fill in. And we feel like we're good -- we're well positioned for almost any scenario that you can think of. I mean, a lot of different OEMs could fill it in, including just a product transition within the OEM that we're talking about.
