My recovery is progressing very nicely. Already this week, in fact, over the course of the last month, I'm beginning to participate in meetings and starting to plan to increase my role in each week going forward.

Thank you, people. I want to thank Brett and the entire United team for their excellent work implementing our shared purpose and vision for United. We really have made significant progress in both our operation and our financial performance. And I'm frankly excited to be here today as we announce record profits for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. And this I tell you cannot have been done without engagement, excitement and energy that exists with [indiscernible] employees.

And like him, we're all looking forward to his full-time return. 
In the meantime, I and the management team want to thank our employees for making 2015 a great year for United. We achieved record financial and operational performance, made meaningful strides toward enhancing the customer experience and is fully committed to continuously earning the trust of customers and employees. While they are -- where we still have more work to do, I am proud of the tangible measures of success we've already demonstrated, none of which could have been accomplished without the work and commitment from the entire United team. Over the last 3 months, I visited each of our hubs, and I'm consistently impressed by our employees' enthusiasm, dedication and strong desire to win, and it is an honor to work alongside them as we take the next steps towards improving United. 
Today, we reported 2015 pretax earnings of $4.5 billion, our highest level of earnings in United's history. I am pleased to announce that through our profit sharing program, employees will be able to share in the success as we pay out $698 million, our largest distribution ever. For the year, we achieved a return on invested capital of 21%, also marking the highest growth ever reported by the United. These numbers represent a meaningful improvement year-over-year as well as progress closing the gap of financial performance of our 2 closest competitors. 
A major contributor to our strong financial performance is improvement in our operation. When compared to last year, our completion rate improved by more than 1 point and on-time performance was 6 points better for the full year 2015. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter as our on-time performance and completion factor were at best since the merger. A well-run operation is a top priority for customers, and we are working extremely hard to become the consistently reliable airline our customers can depend on. 
We also want to be a great place to work for our employees. We have a responsibility to provide them with contracts they deserve. And this fall, we made significant progress to do just that. Evidence of this progress can be found in the 2 new agreements covering both our pilots and technicians that are current in the ratification process. Additionally, we reached an agreement to open negotiations on new contracts for our airport and customer service work groups, more than 1 year in advance of the amendable date. We're also continuing negotiations with our flight attendants and are hopeful that we reach an agreement with them this year. I want to thank these union groups for their commitment to reaching agreements with our workforce in the years to come. 
I am pleased with the progress we made in 2015. We took significant actions that have led to vote strong financial and operational performance. We are excited for the opportunities in 2016 as we focus in making the changes necessary to become the airline that we, our customers and our shareholders expected to be. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg."

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their efforts this year, particularly during the busy holiday travel season. And as Brett mentioned, we have made meaningful improvements to our operation, and we couldn't have done it without the continued hard work and dedication of our employees. Due to the great work of the United team, in 2015, we had best on-time arrival performance since the merger. Additionally, we had a better completion rate than our network competitors in both New York and Chicago, a better completion in Houston than our network competitor in Dallas. We also continued to deliver well on that performance. In fact, during 2015, we achieved record performance for 7 of the 12 months in the year. As reflection of our commitment to operational excellence, we recently launched the new United Global Performance Commitment for corporate customers in 2016. With this program, we will compensate eligible corporate accounts if we fail to meet our operational targets for the year. This clearly demonstrates our level of confidence and commitment to continue to improve United's operational performance. 
Looking forward to 2016, we have a number of opportunities to further improve the operation. One change we implemented earlier this month was an increase in the amount of backsliding we do. Said differently, we are increasing the amount of flight that begins at the hub and then travels to another station before returning directly back to the originating hub. In 2015, approximately 35% of our flights [indiscernible] in that path. At the beginning of this year, we transitioned to approximately 70% of our flights that now follow this pattern, which is more consistent with that of our peers. 
This does two things for us. First, it dramatically reduces the complexity of the operation. In addition, it helps to isolate the impact of weather and aircraft-control-related events to the impacted hub and mitigating impact on our other hubs. We believe that reducing this complexity and limiting the impact of weather on our operations will drive improved reliability and efficiency and provide a better experience for our customers and our employees. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire operations team for all their hard work in 2015. I am proud of the significant progress we made this year, and I look forward to building on these successes in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I would also like to thank our customers for their business in 2015. As Brett indicated earlier, we want to be our customers' first choice on every trip they take, and we will achieve this by continually building their trust. Accomplishing this won't be easy and won't happen overnight, but the entire team is committed to this goal. 
In the fourth quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 6%. The 4 primary factors we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our revenue performance as expected. A strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin-accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions. However, we also faced some unanticipated headwinds during the quarter. First, the attack in Paris put pressure in bookings across the Atlantic during the weeks that followed event. Second, our strong operational performance resulted in more completed flights than initially planned. While this is beneficial to margin and excellent for our customers, the additional capacity provided a tailwind to unit cost, headwinds to PRASM. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw oil prices continue to fall. We've provided incremental pressure to our Houston hub and corporate energy business, while ultimately being a tailwind to our fuel expense and overall earnings. Finally, demand declined throughout the quarter as demonstrated by downward provisions for fourth quarter GDP expectations. 
Turning to the first quarter. We expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year with domestic PRASM down approximately 4% to 6% and international PRASM down approximately 8% to 10%. The major drivers for the first quarter revenue performance are expected to be largely the same as the fourth quarter. For the consolidated system, we expect foreign exchange impacts will account for 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure. 
Given further decline in oil prices, we anticipate continued pressure on lower surcharges, particularly in Japan, which we expect will account for approximately 1 point of weakness. Lower oil prices have reduced revenue from our corporate energy customers, and we are also beginning to see a decline in revenue from the broader [indiscernible] Houston market. The combined revenue pressure from both these energy contracts and the Houston hub is anticipated to be approximately 1 point.  Finally, we also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. 
As we've mentioned before, while PRASM is an important metric, there are other metrics at United that are equally or even more, principally profit margin and earnings. As we construct our network and apply our assets across it, our primary goal is to increase earnings and margin. To that end, there are service decisions that may be dilutive to unit revenue but margin accretive for the business. Over the next several years, we have specific initiatives in place that may have just that effect. Our updating initiative is one such example. Our reducing departures and increasing the average age of our airplanes, we will grow our capacity very efficiently, which will be a tailwind for CASM while putting pressure on our PRASM performance. I would add that it in the case where we replace a single-cabin 50-seat aircraft with a 2-cabin regional small mainline aircraft, there is additional revenue that we can generate from having Economy Plus and First Class seats. In 2016, we anticipate increasing our average age by approximately 5% and reducing our average departures by approximately 1% compared to 2015. 
Another opportunity to grow earnings comes from further improvements to our pricing and segmentation capabilities. As we have seen in 2015, this has become an increasingly important component to revenue management. The more we segment our fares, the better opportunity we will have to minimize revenue dilution. The first place is the rollout of our bundled fare offerings this month. This allows customers to purchase a collection of products suited to their travel as opposed to a more manual process from selecting from an ala carte menu. The second phase, which we expect to launch in the second half of this year, will complement this bundled structure by introducing an entry-level fare that will appeal to the purely price-sensitive customer. We believe this sleight of offerings will allow further segmentation across United's customer base, while also avoiding some levels of revenue dilution built into our pricing structures today. 
Another way we intend to improve our revenue performance is through continuing to improve the reliability of the operation. Reliability is a top priority for our customers. And over the last several years, our revenue have suffered for the inconsistency in our operation. As Greg mentioned, the operation has made significant strides forward, and we expect over time for this to generate additional revenue. Earning the trust of our customers is critical for long-term earnings improvement, and the great work of Greg and his team are cornerstone for that success. 
With respect to capacity, and as a result of reduced planned Atlantic flight, we will reduce our expectations for first quarter capacity and now anticipate growing approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. For the full year, we still expect to grow 1.5% and 2.5%. As we all know, there are certain pockets of the globe that are experiencing economic slowdowns. We are thoughtfully addressing these issues by repositioning capacity to the areas that are experiencing the most economic growth. An example of this is what we are doing in Houston. Due to the decline in the energy business, as we have discussed, our Houston hub has experienced a significant yield pressure. Consequently, we are shifting capacity away from Houston and into other growing markets like Denver and San Francisco. We will remain disciplined in allocating our capacity in the markets that will generate the highest profitability. 
In conclusion, we are continuing to implement margin-accretive initiatives, product improvement and other initiatives across the commercial organization to attract and retain more high-value business customers. In 2016, we anticipate sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and expect that the actions we are taking, along with an improving operation, will further earn the trust of our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

I would also like to thank our employees for helping to make 2015 a record year for United. Their hard work led to our success this year, and I know they will bring the same energy and dedication to our efforts in 2016. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $934 million or $2.54 per share, excluding special items. This is double what we earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 and marks the seventh straight quarter of record earnings. For the full year 2015, we reported $4.5 billion of net income or $11.88 per share, excluding special items, and we achieved a pretax margin of 11.9%, a 6.8 point increase versus last year and the highest in United's history. 
Disciplined cost management has been a key contributor to our results this year. For the full year, our unit cost, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party expenses decreased 0.7%, more than 1 point lower than our initial 2015 guidance, despite nearly 0.5 point of capacity reduction from our regional plans. As Jim mentioned, our upgauging strategy was a meaningful contributor to our CASM performance in 2015, and we expect this contribution will continue as we ramp up the program to 2019. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect our CASM, excluding the impact of new labor deals, to increase approximately 1%. The new labor agreements with our pilots and technicians, currently open for vote, would add approximately 2.5 points of CASM for the year. This is consistent with our commitment to maintain CASM growth below inflation over a planning cycle. 
Two years ago, we set a goal to achieve $1 billion in annual nonfuel savings by 2017. We now expect to achieve this goal in 2016, a full year in advance of our original time line. This focus on continuous improvement and durable savings will not end as we still have opportunities to improve efficiency and manage cost prudently. 
Turning to fuel expense. For 2016, we are 17% hedged and are on a loss position of approximately $225 million. Our portfolio allows us to participate 98% of any future declines. We are currently evaluating the structure of our hedged program. And in the meantime, we have not added any new hedges since July of 2015. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue in the first quarter of 2016, we expect our pretax margin to be between 8% and 10% in the first quarter. 
Moving on to cash flow. In 2015, we generated $6 billion of operating cash flow and $2.5 billion of free cash flow. In deciding how best to allocate capital, I also look at cash flow net of aircraft financing, since the decision to lease versus purchase an aircraft can have a material impact on the traditional calculation of free cash flow. When incorporating proceeds from long-term aircraft financing, we generated over $4 billion in adjusted free cash flow for 2015. I am pleased that we continue to generate significant cash flow in excess of both what we need to run our business and what we need to secure our future. Taking all that into account, in the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $520 million repurchasing United stocks, about double the amount we spent in the prior quarter. For the full year 2015, we spent $1.2 billion in share buyback program. Looking forward, I expect that we will spend at least $750 million repurchasing stock in the first quarter and now plan to complete our current $3 billion program substantially earlier than originally anticipated. 
One of the tools we use is the 10b51 plan, which allows us to purchase stock throughout the quarter even during periods when we might otherwise be unable to be in the market. As an example, we purchased shares in every trading day so far this month. We also used our cash to fulfill one of my primary missions of ensuring that we continue to make all appropriate investments in our business. In 2016, we expect to spend $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.1 billion of non-aircraft CapEx. This would be roughly $100 million more than 2015 for non-aircraft CapEx. This increase is driven almost entirely by incremental technology investments. We believe that further investment in our technology is critical for our ability to compete in the years to come. 
We also expect to invest approximately $1.7 billion on our fleet in 2016. We plan to take delivery of 17 737s, 5 787-9s, our first 777-300ER and 9 used A319s. We will also add 40 Embraer E175 to our regional fleet. Our fleet investments this year also included predelivery deposit associated with the [indiscernible] announced today for 40 737-700 aircraft to be delivered beginning mid-2017. As we have stated in the past, we are continuing to shift more towards the mainline operation as our regional flying is being reduced It is our expectation that our current seat of approximately 250 50-seat aircraft will be reduced by more than half by the end of 2019. While this new 737 order does provide capacity to partially offset the reduction in the regional operation, we are continuing to pursue additional aircraft to continue upgauging and meet our capacity plans. 
We are also utilizing our cash to continue to secure our future. In 2015, we prepaid $1.2 billion of debt, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases, was $17 billion, $1.1 billion less than the end of the prior year. 
In 2015, we also contributed more than $800 million to our pension plans. And as of year-end, our underfunded pension liability is now $1.5 billion, a $700 million reduction from the prior year. As we head towards well-funded status for our pensions, we anticipate contributing approximately $400 million to our pension plans in 2016. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for United as seen in nearly every financial metric. Moving into 2016, we look forward to delivering strong earnings performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation. I believe that the investments we are making in our people and our product will lead to a strong future that will benefit our employees, customers and investors. 
I'll now turn it back over to Jonathan."

So we are very focused on making the investments we have to make. To paraphrase a friend of mine, I know what happens when you take the cheese off the pizza. So we will, first and foremost, make the right investment, so they have to drive the value that we expect or we would stop making some of them. Let me turn to the balance sheet and securing the future, we're in a pretty good spot to the balance sheet, so I would not anticipate the level of debt prepayment that you see in the past. Having said that, the way we will continue to manage the balance sheet is through the amount of new aircraft financing. So I would expect this year to finance some, probably not all of the aircraft this year, and that's [indiscernible] use of cash. I would say, first and foremost, I want to see that cash before I spend the cash. But as we continue to manage our cash sort of down to the target range that we feel comfortable with, that sort of $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity that we've stated as our sort of comfortable target range, there's absolutely the opportunity for additional cash in the buyback. And as I said in my comments, that $750 million is the minimum, so we'll continue to have this dialogue through the year. But I hope you're right. I hope that this is a year that generates those significant cash flows."

The currency, obviously, is a big driver of what we'll look going forward. So kind of where currencies are at today, we would begin to lap some of the currency effects in the second quarter this year. When you look at things such as surcharges. And as you know, the past year, we've talked a lot about surcharges, particularly in Japan, that by law are tied to our oil trades. We'll begin to lap those pretty significantly in the third quarter of this year. But again, there are some sort of charges out in Japan that most recently have come down, so the full effect of that will be more toward the end of the first quarter in 2017. Pricing -- the competitive pricing actions we've talked about through the year, based on where they are at today, we'll begin to lap those in the third quarter of 2016. And then lastly, oil, we've reported on our corporate energy portfolio through the year being down 20% the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter, 35% in the third. And we saw it dropped to 40% in the fourth quarter. So that lapping, given where current oil prices are and the expectations that oil prices will stay lower longer, that effect will take longer than what we've talked about in the past. All being said, there are things that as we lap through the year are -- will have less headwind on our RASM performance, and that's why we've talked about quarter-to-quarter improvements based on the items I described. Always qualify it because, as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw GDP expectations come down from our initial expectations, so that and the volatility of oil prices is still that one thing that we don't like to talk about as specific. But I think given what we see lapping throughout the year, we feel good about quarter-over-quarter improvement as we move through 2016."

And whether it's on the alliance Front or the joint venture front, you look at some of the announcements and some of the relationships and some of your competitors have grown those relationships. And yet when you look at United, you have a strong -- or at least I believe you have a strong relationship with Lufthansa, and you have a good relationship with Air China, and you also have a relationship with ANA. But a lot of times, we don't hear much commentary on it, and it doesn't look like it's showing up in the numbers. I mean, is that perception real?

Well, a couple of thoughts. One is, you mentioned Lufthansa, and Lufthansa a terrific partner for us and our performance in the fourth quarter, albeit down with the 2% [ph] RASM decline was really industry-leading performance -- relative performance trans-Atlantic with our peers. We widened our RASM premium versus our peers in that. That's a great work of our team in terms of balancing the network, and quite frankly, working very closely with Lufthansa. So that JV for us, in that particular, is obviously very much [indiscernible] to the 1990s of the relationship. We had great success in that. If you look -- and so -- and then if you look at the Pacific, which is really a growth market for us, ANA plays a big part of that, and that relationship, from a JV, a little bit younger, but we've made great strides. We've talked about some of the Tokyo when you're flying to places in Asia that we now connect into ANA, which has allowed us to grow our San Francisco hub long-haul. So I think we have used the JVs to help leverage our market and grow our relative performance both in the trans-Atlantic as well as into Asia. Recently, our investment and our commercial agreement with Azure Brazil is a challenged market right now. Over the long term, we think that's going to play terrific. And it's already generating connecting traffic at numbers that are exceeding our expectations, albeit at lower yields, given what's happening in Brazil as well as the currency situation. So I think we're very focused on the alliance side to make sure we have the right partners to extend our network, and we'll do it in a way that obviously allows our customers to have more choice and more opportunities."

One it will allow us to compete with ultra-low-cost carrier much more effectively, which means more product for customers that are looking for just that price point. And it also, as I mentioned, help us remove some of the dilution that we have in our pricing structure today.

In the meantime, I and the management team want to thank our employees for making 2015 a great year for United. We achieved record financial and operational performance, made meaningful strides towards enhancing the customer experience, and this fall, we committed to continuously earning the trust of customers and employees. While we are -- while we still have more work to do, I am proud of the tangible measures of success we have already demonstrated, none of which could have been accomplished without the hard work and commitment from the entire United team. Over the last 3 months, I have visited each of our hubs, and I'm consistently impressed by our employees' enthusiasm, dedication and strong desire to win, and it is an honor to work alongside them as we take the next steps toward improving United. 
Today, we reported 2015 pretax earnings of $4.5 billion, our highest level of earnings in United's history. I am pleased to announce that through our profit-sharing program, employees will be able to share in this success as we pay out $698 million, our largest distribution ever. For the year, we achieved a return on invested capital of 21%, also marking the highest ROIC ever reported by United. These numbers represent a meaningful improvement year-over-year as well as progress closing the gap in financial performance with our 2 closest competitors. 
A major contributor to our strong financial performance is improvement in our operation. When compared to last year, our completion rate improved by more than 1 point and on-time performance was 6 points better for the full year 2015. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter as our on-time performance and completion factor were the best since the merger. A well-run operation is a top priority for customers, and we are working extremely hard to become the consistently reliable airline our customers can depend on. 
We also want to be a great place to work for our employees. We have a responsibility to provide them with contracts they deserve, and this fall, we made significant progress to do just that. Evidence of this progress can be found in the 2 new agreements covering our pilots and technicians that are currently in the ratification process. Additionally, we reached an agreement to open negotiations on new contracts for our airport and customer service work groups more than 1 year in advance of the amendable date. We are also continuing negotiations with our flight attendants and are hopeful that we reach an agreement with them this year. I want to thank these union groups for their commitment to reaching agreements that will lead our workforce in the years to come. 
I am pleased with the progress we made in 2015. We took significant actions that have led to both strong financial and operational performance. We are excited for the opportunities in 2016 as we focus on making the changes necessary to become the airline that we, our customers and our shareholders expected to be. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg."

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their efforts this year, particularly during the busy holiday travel season. And as Brett mentioned, we have made meaningful improvements to our operation, and we couldn't have done it without the continued hard work and dedication of our employees. 
Due to the great work of the United team, in 2015, we had best on-time arrival performance since the merger. Additionally, we had a better completion rate than our network competitors in both New York and Chicago and better completion in Houston than our network competitor in Dallas. We also continue to deliver well on bag performance. In fact, during 2015, we achieved record bag performance for 7 of the 12 months in the year. As reflection of our commitment to operational excellence, we recently launched a new United Global Performance Commitment for corporate customers in 2016. With this program, we will compensate eligible corporate accounts if we fail to meet our operational targets for the year. This clearly demonstrates our level of confidence and commitment to continue to improve United's operational performance. 
Looking forward to 2016, we have a number of opportunities to further improve the operation. One change we implemented earlier this month was an increase in the amount of out-and-back flying we do. Said differently, we are increasing the amount of flying that begins at a hub and then travels to another station before returning directly back to the originating hub. In 2015, approximately 35% of our flights followed an out-and-back pattern. At the beginning of this year, we transitioned to approximately 70% of our flights that now follow this pattern, which is more consistent with that of our peers. 
This does 2 things for us. First, it dramatically reduces the complexity of the operation. In addition, it helps to isolate the impact of weather and air traffic control-related events to the impacted hub while mitigating the impact on our other hubs. We believe that reducing this complexity and limiting the impact of weather on our operations will drive improved reliability and efficiency and provide a better experience for our customers and our employees. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire operations team for all their hard work in 2015. I am proud of the significant progress we made this year, and I look forward to building on these successes in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I would also like to thank our customers for their business in 2015. As Brett indicated earlier, we want to be our customers' first choice on every trip they take, and we will achieve this by continually building their trust. Accomplishing this won't be easy and won't happen overnight, but the entire team is committed to this goal. 
In the fourth quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 6%. The 4 primary factors we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our revenue performance as expected: a strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin-accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions. However, we also faced some unanticipated headwinds during the quarter. First, the attacks in Paris put pressure on bookings across the Atlantic during the weeks that followed the event. Second, our strong operational performance resulted in more completed flights than initially planned. While this is beneficial to margin and excellent for our customers, the additional capacity provided a tailwind to unit cost but a headwind to PRASM. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw oil prices continue to fall, which provided incremental pressure to our Houston hub and corporate energy business while ultimately being a tailwind to our fuel expense and overall earnings. Finally, demand declined throughout the quarter, as demonstrated by downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP expectations. 
Turning to the first quarter. We expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM down approximately 4% to 6% and international PRASM down approximately 8% to 10%. The major drivers for the first quarter revenue performance are expected to be largely the same as the fourth quarter. For the consolidated system, we expect foreign exchange impact to account for 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure. Given further decline in oil prices, we anticipate continued pressure on lower surcharges, particularly in Japan, which we expect will account for approximately 1 point of weakness. Lower oil prices have reduced revenue from our corporate energy customers, and we are also beginning to see a decline in revenue from the broader non-energy Houston market. The combined revenue pressure from both these energy contracts and the Houston hub is anticipated to be approximately 1 point. Finally, we also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. 
As we've mentioned before, while PRASM is an important metric, there are other metrics at United that are equally or even more important, principally profit margin and earnings. As we construct our network and deploy our assets across it, our primary goal is to increase earnings and margins. To that end, there are certain decisions that may be dilutive to unit revenue but are margin accretive for the business. Over the next several years, we have specific initiatives in place that may have just that effect. Our upgauging initiative is one such example. By reducing departures and increasing the average gauge of our airplanes, we will grow our capacity very efficiently, which will be a tailwind for CASM while putting pressure on our PRASM performance. I would add that in the case where we replace a single-cabin 50-seat aircraft with a 2-cabin regional small mainline aircraft, there is additional revenue that we can generate from having Economy Plus and first-class seats. In 2016, we anticipate increasing our average gauge by approximately 5% and reducing our average departures by approximately 1% compared to 2015. 
Another opportunity to grow earnings comes from further improvements through our pricing and segmentation capabilities. As we have seen in 2015, this has become an increasingly important component to revenue management. The more we segment our fares, the better opportunity we will have to minimize revenue dilution. The first phase is the rollout of our bundled fare offerings this month. This allows customers to purchase a collection of products suited to their travel as opposed to a more manual process of selecting from an ala carte menu. The second phase, which we expect to launch in the second half of this year, will complement this bundled structure by introducing an entry-level fare that will appeal to the purely price-sensitive customer. We believe this slate of offerings will allow further segmentation across United's customer base while also avoiding some levels of revenue dilution built into our pricing structures today. 
Another way we intend to improve our revenue performance is through continuing to improve the reliability of the operation. Reliability is a top priority for our customers, and over the last several years, our revenue has suffered from the inconsistency in our operation. As Greg mentioned, the operation has made significant strides forward, and we expect over time for this to generate additional revenue. Earning the trust of our customers is critical for long-term earnings improvement, and the great work from Greg and his team are cornerstone for that success. 
With respect to capacity and as a result of reduced transatlantic flying, we will reduce our expectations for first quarter capacity and now anticipate growing approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. For the full year, we still expect to grow 1.5% and 2.5%. 
As we all know, there are certain pockets of the globe that are experiencing economic slowdowns. We are thoughtfully addressing these issues by repositioning capacity to the areas that are experiencing the most economic growth. An example of this is what we are doing in Houston. Due to the decline in the energy business, as we have discussed, our Houston hub has experienced significant yield pressure. Consequently, we are shifting capacity away from Houston and into other growing markets like Denver and San Francisco. We will remain disciplined in allocating our capacity in the markets that will generate the highest profitability. 
In conclusion, we are continuing to implement margin-accretive initiatives, product improvement and other initiatives across the commercial organization to attract and retain more high-value business customers. In 2016, we anticipate sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and expect that the actions we are taking, along with an improving operation, will further earn the trust of our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

I would also like to thank our employees for helping to make 2015 a record year for United. Their hard work led to our success this year, and I know they will bring the same energy and dedication to our efforts in 2016. For the fourth quart",1056,"Thanks, Jim. I would also like to thank our employees for helping to make 2015 a record year for United. Their hard work led to our success this year, and I know they will bring the same energy and dedication to our efforts in 2016. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $934 million or $2.54 per share, excluding special items. This is double what we earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 and marks the seventh straight quarter of record earnings. For the full year 2015, we reported $4.5 billion of net income or $11.88 per share, excluding special items, and we achieved a pretax margin of 11.9%, a 6.8 point increase versus last year and the highest in United's history. 
Disciplined cost management has been a key contributor to our results this year. For the full year, our unit cost, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party expenses, decreased 0.7%, more than 1 point lower than our initial 2015 guidance, despite nearly 0.5 point of capacity reduction from our original plans. As Jim mentioned, our upgauging strategy was a meaningful contributor to our CASM performance in 2015, and we expect this contribution will continue as we ramp up the program through 2019. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect our CASM, excluding the impact of new labor deals, to increase approximately 1%. The new labor agreements with our pilots and technicians, currently open for vote, would add approximately 2.5 points of CASM for the year. This is consistent with our commitment to maintain CASM growth below inflation over a planning cycle. 
Two years ago, we set a goal to achieve $1 billion in annual nonfuel savings by 2017. We now expect to achieve this goal in 2016, a full year in advance of our original timeline. This focus on continuous improvement and durable savings will not end as we still have opportunities to improve efficiency and manage cost prudently. 
Turning to fuel expense. For 2016, we are 17% hedged and are in a loss position of approximately $225 million. Our portfolio allows us to participate in 98% of any future declines. We are currently evaluating the structure of our hedge program, and in the meantime, we have not added any new hedges since July of 2015. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue in the first quarter of 2016, we expect our pretax margin to be between 8% and 10% in the first quarter. 
Moving on to cash flow. In 2015, we generated $6 billion of operating cash flow and $2.5 billion of free cash flow. In deciding how best to allocate capital, I also look at cash flow net of aircraft financing since the decision to lease versus purchase an aircraft can have a material impact on the traditional calculation of free cash flow. When incorporating proceeds from long-term aircraft financing, we generated over $4 billion in adjusted free cash flow for 2015. I am pleased that we continue to generate significant cash flow in excess of both what we need to run our business and what we need to secure our future. Taking all that into account, in the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $520 million repurchasing United stock, about double the amount we spent in the prior quarter. For the full year 2015, we spent $1.2 billion in the share buyback program. Looking forward, I expect that we will spend at least $750 million repurchasing stock in the first quarter and now plan to complete our current $3 billion program substantially earlier than originally anticipated. 
One of the tools we use is a 10b5-1 plan, which allows us to purchase stock throughout the quarter even during periods when we might otherwise be unable to be in the market. As an example, we purchased shares on every trading day so far this month. We also use our cash to fulfill one of my primary missions of ensuring that we continue to make all appropriate investments in our business. In 2016, we expect to spend $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.1 billion of non-aircraft CapEx. This would be roughly $100 million more than 2015 for non-aircraft CapEx. This increase is driven almost entirely by incremental technology investments. We believe that further investment in our technology is critical for our ability to compete in the years to come. 
We also expect to invest approximately $1.7 billion on our fleet in 2016. We plan to take delivery of 14 737s, 5 787-9s, our first 777-300ER and 9 used A319s. We will also add 40 Embraer E175s to our regional fleet. Our fleet investments this year also include predelivery deposits associated with the order we announced today for 40 737-700 aircraft to be delivered beginning mid-2017. As we have stated in the past, we are continuing to shift more flying towards the mainline operation as our regional flying is being reduced. It is our expectation that our current fleet of approximately 250 50-seat aircraft will be reduced by more than half by the end of 2019. While this new 737 order does provide replacement capacity to partially offset the reduction in the regional operation, we are continuing to pursue additional aircraft to continue upgauging and meet our capacity plans. 
We are also utilizing our cash to continue to secure our future. In 2015, we prepaid $1.2 billion of debt, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases, was $17 billion, $1.1 billion less than the end of the prior year. 
In 2015, we also contributed more than $800 million to our pension plans, and as of year-end, our unfunded pension liability is now $1.5 billion, a $700 million reduction from the prior year. As we head towards well-funded status for our pensions, we anticipate contributing approximately $400 million to our pension plans in 2016. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for United, as seen in nearly every financial metric. Moving into 2016, we look forward to delivering strong earnings performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation. I believe that the investments we are making in our people and our product will lead to a strong future that will benefit our employees, customers and investors. 
I'll now turn it back over to Jonathan."

So we will, first and foremost, make the right investment, but they have to drive the value that we expect or we would stop making some of them. Let me turn to the balance sheet and in securing the future. We're in a pretty good spot with the balance sheet, so I would not anticipate the level of debt prepayment that you've seen in the past. Having said that, the way we will continue to manage the balance sheet is through the amount of new aircraft financing. So I would expect this year to finance some, probably not all, of the aircraft this year, and that's going to potentially leave some cash. I would say, first and foremost, I want to see that cash before I spend the cash. But as we continue to manage our cash sort of down to the target range that we feel comfortable with, that sort of $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity that we've stated as our sort of comfortable target range, there's absolutely the opportunity for additional cash in the buyback. And as I said in my comments, that $750 million is the minimum, so we'll continue to have this dialogue through the year. But I hope you're right.

The currency, obviously, is a big driver of what we look going forward. So kind of where currencies are at today, we would begin to lap some of the currency effects in the second quarter this year. When you look at things such as surcharges, and as you know, over the past year, we've talked a lot about surcharges, particularly in Japan, that, by law, are tied to where oil trades. We'll begin to lap those pretty significantly in the third quarter of this year. But again, there are still some sort of charges out of Japan that most recently have come down, so the full effect of that will be more toward the end of the first quarter in 2017. Pricing -- the competitive pricing actions we've talked about through the year, based on where they're at today, we'd begin to lap those in the third quarter of 2016. And then lastly, oil, we've reported on our corporate energy portfolio through the year being down 20% in the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter, 35% in the third. And we saw it drop to 40% in the fourth quarter. So that lapping, given where current oil prices are and the expectations that oil prices will stay low longer, that lapping effect will take longer than what we've talked about in the past. All being said, there are things that, as we lap through the year, will have less headwind on our RASM performance, and that's why we've talked about quarter-to-quarter improvement based on the factors I described. Always qualify it because, as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw GDP expectations come down from our initial expectations, so that and the volatility of oil prices is still that one thing that we don't like to talk about as specific. But I think given what we see lapping during the year, we feel good about quarter-over-quarter improvement as we move through 2016."

And then just a second question. When you look at your overall revenue performance and you compare yourself versus, notably, the other big 2, American and Delta, and you look at yourselves on a unit revenue basis, I appreciate the fact that, obviously, there are some initiatives that you're pursuing that are obviously margin accretive and ROIC accretive. And therefore, one consequence is that they may be RASM or PRASM dilutive. But I think there's another view out there, at least the perception that maybe strategically, you are falling a bit behind your peers. And whether it's on the alliance front or the joint venture front, you look at some of the announcements and some of the relationships and how some of your competitors have grown those relationships. And yet when you look at United, you have a strong -- or at least I believe you have a strong relationship with Lufthansa, and you have a good relationship with Air China, and you also have a relationship with ANA. But a lot of times, we don't hear much commentary on it, and it doesn't look like it's showing up in the numbers. I mean, is that perception real? Or are there things that, over the next year or so, that you plan to roll out that maybe will help mitigate some of those revenue sort of differences?"

One is you mentioned Lufthansa in the transatlantic. It's a terrific partner for us. And our Atlantic performance in the fourth quarter, albeit down with the 2% RASM decline, was really industry-leading performance and our relative performance in the transatlantic against our peers. We've widened our RASM premium versus our peers in that. That was the great work of our team in terms of seasonally balancing the network and, quite frankly, working very closely with Lufthansa. So that JV for us in that particular is obviously very mature. It goes back into the 1990s relationship. And so we had great success in that. If you look -- and so -- and then if you look at the Pacific, which is really -- a really growth market for us, ANA plays a [indiscernible] big part of that. And that relationship from a JV, a little bit younger, but we've made great strides, and we've talked about some of the Tokyo linear flying to places in Asia that we now connect into ANA, which has allowed us to grow our San Francisco hub long haul. So I think we have used the JVs to help leverage our market and grow our relative performance both in the transatlantic as well as into Asia. Recently, our investment and our commercial agreement with Azul, although Brazil is a challenged market right now, over the long term, we think that's going to pay terrific dividends. And it's already generating connecting traffic at numbers that are exceeding our expectations, albeit at lower yields, given what's happening in Brazil as well as the currency situation. So I think we're very focused on the alliance side to make sure we have the right partners, extend our network, and we'll do it in a way that obviously allows our customers to have more choice and more opportunity."

But today, let me start, frankly, by extending my thanks for all the well wishes I've received from across my United family during my situation. I'm pleased to report that I feel great. My recovery is progressing very nicely. Already this week, in fact, over the course of the last month, I've begun to participate in meetings and certainly plan to increase my involvement each week going forward. As far as expectation of full return, I certainly will be back full time by the end of the first quarter, if not sooner, and I'm incredibly energized by that prospect. So again, I look forward to seeing a lot of you out on the road. 
As I'm thanking people, I want to thank Brett and the entire United team for their excellent work in implementing our shared purpose and vision for United. We really have made significant progress in both our operation and our financial performance. I'm frankly excited to be here today as we announce record profits for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. And this, I'd tell you, cannot have been done without the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that exists with our frontline employees. I'm very proud of what they do each and every day, and we are going to leverage and use this increased level of engagement to continue the momentum into 2016 and beyond. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Brett."

And like him, we're all looking forward to his full-time return. 
In the meantime, I and the management team want to thank our employees for making 2015 a great year for United. We achieved record financial and operational performance, made meaningful strides towards enhancing the customer experience, and this fall, we committed to continuously earning the trust of customers and employees. While we are -- while we still have more work to do, I am proud of the tangible measures of success we have already demonstrated, none of which could have been accomplished without the hard work and commitment from the entire United team. Over the last 3 months, I have visited each of our hubs and I am consistently impressed by our employees' enthusiasm, dedication and strong desire to win, and it is an honor to work alongside them as we take the next steps toward improving United. 
Today, we reported 2015 pretax earnings of $4.5 billion, our highest level of earnings in United's history. I am pleased to announce that through our profit-sharing program, employees will be able to share in this success as we pay out $698 million, our largest distribution ever. For the year, we achieved a return on invested capital of 21%, also marking the highest ROIC ever reported by United. These numbers represent a meaningful improvement year-over-year as well as progress closing the gap in financial performance with our 2 closest competitors. 
A major contributor to our strong financial performance is the improvement in our operation. When compared to last year, our completion rate improved by more than 1 point and on-time performance was 6 points better for the full year 2015. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter as our on-time performance and completion factor were the best since the merger. A well-run operation is a top priority for customers and we are working extremely hard to become the consistently reliable airline our customers can depend on. 
We also want to be a great place to work for our employees. We have a responsibility to provide them with contracts they deserve, and this fall, we made significant progress to do just that. Evidence of this progress can be found in the 2 new agreements covering our pilots and technicians that are currently in the ratification process. Additionally, we reached an agreement to open negotiations on new contracts for our airport and customer service work groups more than 1 year in advance of the amendable date. We are also continuing negotiations with our flight attendants and are hopeful that we reach an agreement with them this year. I want to thank these union groups for their commitment to reaching agreements that will lead our workforce in the years to come. 
I am pleased with the progress we made in 2015. We took significant actions that have led to both strong financial and operational performance. We are excited for the opportunities in 2016 as we focus on making the changes necessary to become the airline that we, our customers and our shareholders expect it to be. 
Now I'll turn it over to Greg."

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their efforts this year, particularly during the busy holiday travel season. And as Brett mentioned, we have made meaningful improvements to our operation, and we couldn't have done it without the continued hard work and dedication of our employees. 
Due to the great work of the United team, in 2015, we had the best on-time arrival performance since the merger. Additionally, we had a better completion rate than our network competitors in both New York and Chicago and better completion in Houston than our network competitor in Dallas. We also continue to deliver well on bag performance. In fact, during 2015, we achieved record bag performance for 7 of the 12 months in the year. As a reflection of our commitment to operational excellence, we recently launched a new United Global Performance Commitment for corporate customers in 2016. With this program, we will compensate eligible corporate accounts if we fail to meet our operational targets for the year. This clearly demonstrates our level of confidence and commitment to continue to improve United's operational performance. 
Looking forward to 2016, we have a number of opportunities to further improve the operation. One change we implemented earlier this month was an increase in the amount of out-and-back flying we do. Said differently, we are increasing the amount of flying that begins at a hub and then travels to another station before returning directly back to the originating hub. In 2015, approximately 35% of our flights followed an out-and-back pattern. At the beginning of this year, we transitioned to approximately 70% of our flights that now follow this pattern, [indiscernible] which is more consistent with that of our peers. 
This does 2 things for us. First, it dramatically reduces the complexity of the operation. In addition, it helps to isolate the impact of weather and air traffic control-related events to the impacted hub while mitigating the impact on our other hubs. We believe that reducing this complexity and limiting the impact of weather on our operations will drive improved reliability and efficiency and provide a better experience for our customers and our employees. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire operations team for all their hard work in 2015. I am proud of the significant progress we made this year, and I look forward to building on these successes in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I would also like to thank our customers for their business in 2015. As Brett indicated earlier, we want to be our customers' first choice on every trip they take, and we will achieve this by continually building their trust. Accomplishing this won't be easy and won't happen overnight, but the entire team is committed to this goal. 
In the fourth quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 6%. The 4 primary factors we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our revenue performance as expected: a strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin-accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions. However, we also faced some unanticipated headwinds during the quarter. First, the attacks in Paris put pressure on bookings across the Atlantic during the weeks that followed the event. Second, our strong operational performance resulted in more completed flights than initially planned. While this is beneficial to margin and excellent for our customers, the additional capacity provided a tailwind to unit cost but a headwind to PRASM. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw oil prices continue to fall, which provided incremental pressure to our Houston hub and corporate energy business while ultimately being a tailwind to our fuel expense and overall earnings. Finally, demand declined throughout the quarter, as demonstrated by downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP expectations. 
Turning to the first quarter. We expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM down approximately 4% to 6% and international PRASM down approximately 8% to 10%. The major drivers for the first quarter revenue performance are expected to be largely the same as the fourth quarter. For the consolidated system, we expect foreign exchange impact to account for 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure. Given further decline in oil prices, we anticipate continued pressure from lower surcharges, particularly in Japan, which we expect will account for approximately 1 point of weakness. Lower oil prices have reduced revenue from our corporate energy customers, and we are also beginning to see a decline in revenue from the broader non-energy Houston market. The combined revenue pressure from both these energy contracts and the Houston hub is anticipated to be approximately 1 point. Finally, we also expect that current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. 
As we've mentioned before, while PRASM is an important metric, there are other metrics at United that are equally or even more important, principally profit margin and earnings. As we construct our network and deploy our assets across it, our primary goal is to increase earnings and margins. To that end, there are certain decisions that may be dilutive to unit revenue but are margin accretive for the business. Over the next several years, we have specific initiatives in place that may have just that effect. Our upgauging initiative is one such example. By reducing departures and increasing the average gauge of our airplanes, we will grow our capacity very efficiently, which will be a tailwind for CASM while putting pressure on our PRASM performance. I would add that in the case where we replace a single-cabin 50-seat aircraft with a 2-cabin regional small mainline aircraft, there is additional revenue that we can generate from having Economy Plus and first-class seats. In 2016, we anticipate increasing our average gauge [ph] by approximately 5% and reducing our average departures by approximately 1% compared to 2015. 
Another opportunity to grow earnings comes from further improvements to our pricing and segmentation capabilities. As we have seen in 2015, this has become an increasingly important component to revenue management. The more we segment our fares, the better opportunity we will have to minimize revenue dilution. The first phase is the rollout of our bundled fare offerings this month. This allows customers to purchase a collection of products suited to their travel as opposed to a more manual process of selecting from an ala carte menu. The second phase, which we expect to launch in the second half of this year, will complement this bundled structure by introducing an entry-level fare that will appeal to the purely price-sensitive customer. We believe this slate of offerings will allow further segmentation across United's customer base while also avoiding some levels of revenue dilution built into our pricing structures today. 
Another way we intend to improve our revenue performance is through continuing to improve the reliability of the operation. Reliability is a top priority for our customers, and over the last several years, our revenue has suffered from the inconsistency in our operation. As Greg mentioned, the operation has made significant strides forward, and we expect over time for this to generate additional revenue. Earning the trust of our customers is critical for long-term earnings improvement, and the great work from Greg and his team are a cornerstone for that success. 
With respect to capacity and as a result of reduced transatlantic flying, we reduced our expectations for first quarter capacity and now anticipate growing approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. For the full year, we still expect to grow 1.5% and 2.5%. 
As we all know, there are certain pockets of the globe that are experiencing economic slowdowns. We are thoughtfully addressing these issues by repositioning capacity to the areas that are experiencing the most economic growth. An example of this is what we are doing in Houston. Due to the decline in the energy business, as we have discussed, our Houston hub has experienced significant yield pressure. Consequently, we are shifting capacity away from Houston and into other growing markets like Denver and San Francisco. We will remain disciplined in allocating our capacity in the markets that will generate the highest profitability. 
In conclusion, we are continuing to implement margin-accretive initiatives, product improvements and other initiatives across the commercial organization to attract and retain more high-value business customers. In 2016, we anticipate sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and expect that the actions we are taking, along with an improving operation, will further earn the trust of our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

I would also like to thank our employees for helping to make 2015 a record year for United. Their hard work led to our success this year, and I know they will bring the same energy and dedication to our efforts in 2016. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $934 million or $2.54 per share, excluding special items. This is double what we earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 and marks the seventh straight quarter of record earnings. For the full year 2015, we reported $4.5 billion of net income or $11.88 per share, excluding special items, and we achieved a pretax margin of 11.9%, a 6.8 point increase versus last year and the highest in United's history. 
Disciplined cost management has been a key contributor to our results this year. For the full year, our unit cost, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party expenses, decreased 0.7%, more than 1 point lower than our initial 2015 guidance, despite nearly 0.5 point of capacity reduction from our original plans. As Jim mentioned, our upgauging strategy was a meaningful contributor to our CASM performance in 2015, and we expect this contribution will continue as we ramp up the program through 2019. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect our CASM, excluding the impact of new labor deals, to increase approximately 1%. The new labor agreements with our pilots and technicians, currently open for vote, would add approximately 2.5 points of CASM for the year. This is consistent with our commitment to maintain CASM growth below inflation over a planning cycle. 
Two years ago, we set a goal to achieve $1 billion in annual nonfuel savings by 2017. We now expect to achieve this goal in 2016, a full year in advance of our original timeline. This focus on continuous improvement and durable savings will not end as we still have opportunities to improve efficiency and manage cost prudently. 
Turning to fuel expense. For 2016, we are 17% hedged and are in a loss position of approximately $225 million. Our portfolio allows us to participate in 98% of any future declines. We are currently evaluating the structure of our hedge program, and in the meantime, we have not added any new hedges since July of 2015. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue in the first quarter of 2016, we expect our pretax margin to be between 8% and 10% in the first quarter. 
Moving on to cash flow. In 2015, we generated $6 billion of operating cash flow and $2.5 billion of free cash flow. In deciding how best to allocate capital, I also look at cash flow net of aircraft financing since the decision to lease versus purchase an aircraft can have a material impact on the traditional calculation of free cash flow. When incorporating proceeds from long-term aircraft financing, we generated over $4 billion in adjusted free cash flow for 2015. I am pleased that we continue to generate significant cash flow in excess of both what we need to run our business and what we need to secure our future. Taking all that into account, in the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $520 million repurchasing United stock, about double the amount we spent in the prior quarter. For the full year 2015, we spent $1.2 billion in the share buyback program. Looking forward, I expect that we will spend at least $750 million repurchasing stock in the first quarter and now plan to complete our current $3 billion program substantially earlier than originally anticipated. 
One of the tools we use is a 10b5-1 plan, which allows us to purchase stock throughout the quarter even during periods when we might otherwise be unable to be in the market. As an example, we purchased shares on every trading day so far this month. We also use our cash to fulfill one of my primary missions of ensuring that we continue to make all appropriate investments in our business. In 2016, we expect to spend $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.1 billion of non-aircraft CapEx. This would be roughly $100 million more than 2015 for non-aircraft CapEx. This increase is driven almost entirely by incremental technology investments. We believe that further investment in our technology is critical for our ability to compete in the years to come. 
We also expect to invest approximately $1.7 billion on our fleet in 2016. We plan to take delivery of 14 737s, 5 787-9s, our first 777-300ER and 9 used A319s. We will also add 40 Embraer E175s to our regional fleet. Our fleet investments this year also include predelivery deposits associated with the order we announced today for 40 737-700 aircraft to be delivered beginning mid-2017. As we have stated in the past, we are continuing to shift more flying towards the mainline operation as our regional flying is being reduced. It is our expectation that our current fleet of approximately 250 50-seat aircraft will be reduced by more than half by the end of 2019. While this new 737 order does provide replacement capacity to partially offset the reduction in the regional operation, we are continuing to pursue additional aircraft to continue upgauging and meet our capacity plans. 
We are also utilizing our cash to continue to secure our future. In 2015, we prepaid $1.2 billion of debt, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases, was $17 billion, $1.1 billion less than the end of the prior year. 
In 2015, we also contributed more than $800 million to our pension plans, and as of year-end, our unfunded pension liability is now $1.5 billion, a $700 million reduction from the prior year. As we head towards well-funded status for our pensions, we anticipate contributing approximately $400 million to our pension plans in 2016. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for United, as seen in nearly every financial metric. Moving into 2016, we look forward to delivering strong earnings performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation. I believe that the investments we are making in our people and our product will lead to a strong future that will benefit our employees, customers and investors. 
I'll now turn it back over to Jonathan."

But if we assume you guys have significantly more cash of which to dispose this year, which I'm putting at about $6 billion to $7 billion, factoring in pension contributions, assumptions around financed CapEx and maybe a little bit of excess cash, shouldn't it be a fairly obvious decision to make that the level of buybacks this year exceeds your capital spending given the immediate accretion that you get to EPS, not to mention the signal you'll send to your long-term shareholders about the trajectory of earnings beyond this year?"

So we are very focused on making the investments we have to make. To paraphrase an old friend of mine, I know what happens when you take the cheese off the pizza. So we will, first and foremost, make the right investments, but they have to drive the value that we expect or we would stop making some of them. Then we turn to the balance sheet and in securing the future. We're in a pretty good spot with the balance sheet, so I would not anticipate the level of debt prepayment that you've seen in the past. Having said that, the way we will continue to manage the balance sheet is through the amount of new aircraft financing. So I would expect this year to finance some, probably not all, of the aircraft this year, and that's going to potentially leave some cash. I would say, first and foremost, I want to see that cash before I spend the cash. But as we continue to manage our cash sort of down to the target range that we feel comfortable with, that sort of $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity that we have stated as our sort of comfortable target range, there's absolutely the opportunity for additional cash in the buyback. And as I said in my comments, that $750 million is the minimum, so we'll continue to have this dialogue through the year. But I hope you're right. I hope that this is a year that generates those significant cash flows."

But currency, obviously, is a big driver of what we look going forward. So kind of where currencies are at today, we would begin to lap some of the currency effects in the second quarter of this year. When you look at things such as surcharges, and as you know, over the past year, we've talked a lot about surcharges, particularly in Japan, that, by law, are tied to where oil trades. We'll begin to lap those pretty significantly in the third quarter of this year. But again, there are still some surcharges out of Japan that most recently have come down, so the full effect of that will be more toward the end of the first quarter in 2017. Pricing -- the competitive pricing actions we've talked about through the year, based on where they're at today, we begin to lap those in the third quarter of 2016. And then lastly, oil, we've reported on our corporate energy portfolio through the year being down 20% in the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter, 35% in the third. And we saw it drop to 40% in the fourth quarter. So that lapping, given where current oil prices are and the expectations that oil prices will stay low longer, that lapping effect will take longer than what we've talked about in the past. All being said, there are things that, as we lap through the year, will have less headwind on our RASM performance, and that's why we've talked about quarter-to-quarter improvement based on the factors I described. Always qualify it because, as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw GDP expectations come down from our initial expectations, so that and the volatility of oil prices is still that one thing that we don't like to talk about as specific. But I think given what we see lapping during the year, we feel good about the quarter-over-quarter improvement as we move through 2016."

And therefore, one consequence is that they may be RASM or PRASM dilutive. But I think there's another view out there, at least a perception that maybe strategically, you are falling a bit behind your peers. And whether it's on the alliance front or the joint venture front, you look at some of the announcements and some of the relationships and how some of your competitors have grown those relationships. And yet when you look at United, you have a strong -- or at least I believe you have a strong relationship with Lufthansa, and you have a good relationship with Air China, and you also have a relationship with ANA. But a lot of times, we don't hear much commentary on it, and it doesn't look like it's showing up in the numbers. I mean, is that perception real? Or are there things that, over the next year or so, that you plan to roll out that maybe will help mitigate some of those revenue sort of differences?"

One is you mentioned Lufthansa in the transatlantic, which are a terrific partner for us. And our Atlantic performance in the fourth quarter, albeit down with a 2% RASM decline, was really industry-leading performance. In our relative performance in the transatlantic against our peers, we've widened our RASM premium versus our peers in that. That was the great work of our team in terms of seasonally balancing the network and, quite frankly, working very closely with Lufthansa. So that JV for us in that particular is obviously very mature. It goes back into the 1990s relationship. And so we've had great success in that. If you look -- and so -- and then if you look at the Pacific, which is really -- a really growth market for us, ANA plays a terrific -- a big part of that. And that relationship from a JV, a little bit younger, but we've made great strides, and we've talked about some of the Tokyo linear flying to places in Asia that we now connect into ANA, which has allowed us to grow our San Francisco hub long haul. So I think we have used the JVs to help leverage our market and grow our relative performance both in the transatlantic as well as into Asia. Recently, our investment and our commercial agreement with Azul, although it's Brazil, it is a challenged market right now, over the long term, we think that's going to pay terrific dividends. And it's already generating connecting traffic at numbers that are exceeding our expectations, albeit at lower yields, given what's happening in Brazil as well as the currency situation. So I think we're very focused on the alliance side to make sure we have the right partners, extend our network, and we'll do it in a way that obviously allows our customers to have more choice and more opportunity."

For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter pretax profit ever. 
We achieved diluted  earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes and as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter last year. 
This improvement demonstrates the dedication, fashion and hard work of United aviation professionals. I know as I cover the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day.  I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. 
This quarter's results showed great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, trying both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became first U.S. airline to service Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology leaders. 
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them like a more reliable operation, improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lighting effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employee is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilot, dispatchers and IAM representative workers all ratifying contract expansion this year. This represents half of our union as workforce. 
We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we will working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you heard, yesterday, we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers were identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our CASM performance in line with initial expectations. I",631,"Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers were identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our CASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proves to be greater than we had expected. 
While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. 
While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. While any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each markets to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability, while also positioning ourselves to a longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. 
We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat to positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from the industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. 
And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, 0.5-point  reduction from our reviews full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. 
Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. 
More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are on loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. 
For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%, and for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved full year in advance around our initial expectation and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreement. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point to CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2  737 and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer 175 to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders to 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage, while providing customers with larger 2-cabin aircraft with great amenities. 
Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into a larger gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747 as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decisions does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, the first quarter solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. 
Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

So we are focused very much on international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity, that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. Net canceling drop from our previous guidance is all international. So what is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity was more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summertime in trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the years is basically flat after doing seasonality adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on international side. The initiatives to move capacity and to write places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM as we go through the year."

I will say about the Pacific is also impacted but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. So we believe even in that entity that will continue to close, move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even markets we're adding, as Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities, when you think about San Fran to Singapore, a very unique and innovative for us is the first nonstop market to the U.S. from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationships and and growing our relationships with Air New Zealand.

Hey, Hunter, there are structural differences between network and I think of them as mainly driven by geographies. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that by definition is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, which also means there's a lot of competition. And I think we're referring to seat chair and so forth. That result of those competition large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub, they're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business Central markets drive more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs and again -- we think that, that have structure works for us really well, for instance, in New York, it is the [indiscernible] in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high yield flow traffic versus low-yield traffic that's unique to us. All of those things was driving national length [indiscernible]."

I would emphasize corporate is still a little bit soft. But we saw our corporate portfolio in the first quarter down 3%. This will count energy, it's down about 2%. So the energy sector is impacting us. We expect that to continue to the second quarter given where oil prices are. So the corporate sector -- the energy sector as well as the overall Houston hub will continue to put pressure on us. So we see good demand. We see strong demand, but quite frankly, it's at lower yields.

And we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the the trans-Atlantic. The one area that will probably lag it because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollars, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro. So we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat RASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. We have a good path to it.

Hedging is just one tool that can help provide better certainties as we try to achieve our business plan. It's no longer for us a hedging in the near-term volatility, that's a very expensive insurance policy that we can just stop, ensure that risk. So it's just one tool. There are a number of factors that we'll look at, including our net exposure to fuel. One of the benefits of the Houston hub work from the other way that as fuel prices rise, there's a correlation on revenue particularly in Houston. So it would be the next exposure that we would focus on. The competitive landscape, what others are doing that could impact the industry and the overall economic environment. So we'll be thoughtful about our hedging. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have not done any hedging since last summer and while there has been some volatility in fuel recently, from a historical perspective, it's still a very low fuel environment."

There are a number of factors but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at the very low cost, factor rate the high [indiscernible] to leasing companies to overcome and historically there have been do that, they are better able to today surpass through their lower cost to fund to us, that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. Unique to make leasing work, the situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenant think of it like buying on a deal. You're going to trade in your auto deal every 2 or 3 years. Leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we booked at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work and likely done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I already adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So rather lease, rather we use WTC or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders and as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter pretax profit ever. 
We achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion and hard work of United aviation professionals. I know as I cover the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work everyday. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. This quarter's results showed great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make and people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became first U.S. airline to service Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology communities.
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them, like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lighting effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employee is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilots, dispatchers and the IAM representative workers all ratifying contract expansion this year. This represents half of our union as workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you heard, yesterday, we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members, and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to -- the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%.

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. 
As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat-to-positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high-opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a 0.5-point reduction from our previous full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are on a loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved full year in advance around our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreements. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2  737s and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer E175s to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders, the 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger, 2-cabin aircraft with great amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into larger-gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decisions does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, in the first quarter, solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

The way on the international side is clearly, depending on the regions of the world throughout, like take China, for instance, where our passage demand is growing at a fast pace even in that high-capacity demand. So we believe that over the long term, that, that capacity demand will come in line. 
What we are excited about is that our uniqueness as to how we're participating in China. It's unique in the sense that it's, as Oscar mentioned, 2 new secondary cities in China. That growth that I mentioned out of China after that will come from secondary cities. But the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at a very early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we'll be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments, we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter."

Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter, and we're working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. Now I do want to emphasize international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much on that international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity adjustments that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That cap point drop from our previous guidance is all international. So what is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity was more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summer time for trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonality adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but we've put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiative to move capacity into right places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability. Given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM as we go through the year."

I would just add to that. As we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates a revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have Economy Plus . They don't have a first-class cabin, and we continue to see great upsell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economies there, plus sales."

I will say about the Pacific is also impacted, but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange, and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. 
So we believe, even in that entity, that we'll continue to close, move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, I understand that Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities. When you think about San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first nonstop market to the U.S. from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30, off to a great start, and that make 2 high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So all of those, you would say that uniqueness of our expansion, we think, serves us well and it comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent.

Hey, Hunter, yes, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that, by definition, is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, and -- which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you were referring to seat share and so forth. That's a result of those competition's large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets drives more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs, and we think that, that hub structure works for us really well, for instance, in New York. It is the only tube connecting up in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high-yield flow traffic versus low-yield connect traffic that's unique to us.

We do see signs kind of mid-May and into June, that positive signs that would point to strengthening in yield as we get closer to that. It's a little bit really on the business traffic to window, but where our yields are right now, we feel pretty good that we see some demand picking up as we move towards the summer, beginning in mid-May. I would emphasize corporate is still a little bit soft. But we saw our corporate portfolio in the first quarter, down 3%. If you, too, count energy, it's down about 2%. So the energy sector is impacting us. We expect that to continue to the second quarter given where oil prices are. So the corporate sector -- the energy sector as well as the overall Houston hub will continue to put pressure on us. 
So we see good demand. We see strong demand, but quite frankly, it's at lower yields. And then I'll point to the slide I showed in the presentation, and we do have some supply and demand dynamics affecting and diluting yield as we think about the near term. But I'll close it with, we see demand picking up kind of mid-May, June with some signs of stronger yields."

And as I think about it, I would have maybe anticipated a bigger decline in 50-seaters rather than 70-seaters. I'm just curious if that reduction is a function of the fact that you're bringing in a lot of 175s, the Embraer aircraft, and maybe that you're up against scope, and so as 175s come in, you've got to take out CRJ-700.

We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat-to-positive RASM into the domestic -- consolidate domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the trans-Atlantic. The one area that we'll probably lag it, because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro. So we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat RASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. We have a good path to it.

One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know,",327,"Sure, Savi. Let me talk about leasing first. I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at the very low cost. Tax rates, they hide hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically, they haven't been able to do that. They're better able to today surpass through their lower cost to fund to us, but that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work, the situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenant. Think of it like buying on a deal. You're going to trade in your auto mobile every 2 or 3 years. Leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we booked at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years, and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work. And likely done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. 
But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So whether at the lease, whether we use WTCs or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit",544,"Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit ever. 
We achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion and hard work of United's aviation professionals. I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make and people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology communities.
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them, like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilots, dispatchers and the IAM representative work groups all ratify contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you've heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members, and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to -- the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. In",627,"Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. 
As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat-to-positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high-opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a 0.5-point reduction from our previous full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are in a loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreements. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2 737s and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer E175s to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger, 2-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into larger-gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, in the first quarter, solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

Those are a little bit more competitive than others, but as you -- as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do. And so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on 3 areas of strategic focus. Certainly, we need to win on revenue, and it's just not markets and scheduling price but its products and service. Execution, which we're doing a good job already. Reliability, certainly. Productivity, we just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost, of course, is included in that.

So we believe that over the long term, that, that capacity demand will come in line.
What we are excited about is that our uniqueness as to how we're participating in China. It's unique in the sense that it's, as Oscar mentioned, 2 new secondary cities in China. That growth that I mentioned out of China, after that will come from secondary cities. But the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at an early, early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we'll be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments, we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter."

Nobody is accusing you of not having a full plate here.

Interestingly enough, I have a couple of new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But no, it definitely has to change. Accepting the same thing comes to me over and over, especially in this market -- there have been decreasing demand brought overall, global economic picture, our increasing expenses on the labor side and all those things. We have to do things differently to many, many factors. And so you will see some of that thrust here for the next few months as far as the initiatives.

Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter, and we're working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. Now I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much on that international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity adjustments that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That 1/2 point drop from our previous guidance is all international. So one is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summer time for trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but they've put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiative to move capacity into right places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability. Given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM improvement as we go through the year."

But generally, with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense. 
I would just add to that. As we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have Economy Plus. They don't have a first-class cabin, and we continue to see great upsell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economies there, plus sales."

I will say about the Pacific is also impacted, but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange, and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. 
So we believe, even in that entity, that we'll continue to close -- move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, San -- Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities. But you think about San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first nonstop market to the U.S. just from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30, off to a great start, and that make 2 high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion, we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent.

It'll bring us closer together in some sales initiatives that allows us to understand the marketplace, and we think that will enhance our connections through the market as we build, not only Beijing, but as we build in some of the secondary cities.

Hey, Hunter, yes, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that, by definition, is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, and -- which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you were referring to seat share and so forth. That's a result of those competition's large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets, drives more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs, and we think that, that hub structure works for us really well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high-yield flow traffic versus low-yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive actual stage length now."

What we generally see is a slowdown in bookings after events like that. Those begin to pick back up, but quite frankly, it looms days, even weeks of the booking curve, and that's impacting the second quarter, which is why the trans-Atlantic, as you move towards the summer period, that booking curve still has plenty of time to fill up, and we see that demand.

And as I think about it, I would have maybe anticipated a bigger decline in 50-seaters rather than 70-seaters. I'm just curious if that reduction is a function of the fact that you're bringing in a lot of 175s, the Embraer aircraft, and maybe that you're up against scope, and so as 175s come in, you've got to take out CRJ-700.

We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat-to-positive RASM in the domestic -- consolidate domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the trans-Atlantic. The one area that we'll probably lag it, because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro. So we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. We have a good path to it.

Let me talk about leasing first. I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know,",328,"Sure, Savi. Let me talk about leasing first. I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That's raise a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically, they haven't been able to do that. They're better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us, but that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work, a situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenor. Think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every 2 or 3 years, leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we book at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years, and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. 
But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So whether it's a lease, whether we use WTCs or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

You think about disconnects and having to deal with the cost of putting customers up at hotels and meals and whatnot and crude cost as well.

For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit",544,"Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit ever. 
We achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion and hard work of United's aviation professionals. I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make and people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology communities.
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them, like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilots, dispatchers and the IAM representative work groups all ratify contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you've heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members, and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to -- the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"
309845,331140953,962047,"United Continental Holdings, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","United Airlines Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. In",627,"Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. 
As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat-to-positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high-opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a 0.5-point reduction from our previous full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

Good morning, everyone. A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11.

A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are in a loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreements. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2 737s and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer E175s to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger, 2-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into larger-gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, in the first quarter, solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

Those are a little bit more competitive than others, but as you -- as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do. And so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on 3 areas of strategic focus. Certainly, we need to win on revenue, and it's just not markets and scheduling price but its products and service. Execution, which we're doing a good job already. Reliability, certainly. Productivity, we just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost, of course, is included in that.

It's unique in the sense that it's, as Oscar mentioned, 2 new secondary cities in China. That growth that I mentioned out of China, after that will come from secondary cities. But the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at an early, early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we'll be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments, we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter."

I realized that with everything going on with the board, that may have been a distraction. And you're getting involved with the flight attendant negotiations. Nobody is accusing you of not having a full plate here. But traditionally, when companies start falling further and further behind their competitors, and based on the guide, that is what you expect in the second quarter, they're faced with 3 choices: You can do nothing, you can simply try harder or you can come up with a new plan. So my question is simple. Does mediocrity suffice, is fixing United as simple as rolling up your sleeves and relying on easier comps? Or is something significantly more radical, a change in course, ultimately required?"

It's -- I think one of the things that is important to know is that we didn't concede in anything on anyone. And so what we've been doing is decline profitably. I've watched and monitor how that works. We need to be, in my mind, a bit more disruptive in the marketplace. I think we've been outstanding by a little bit too much, know exactly what that means and how we do it thoughtfully and from a shareholder sort of value-creating perspective, is the work we're beginning to do. Interestingly enough, I have a couple of new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But no, it definitely has to change. Accepting the same thing comes to me over and over, especially in this market -- there have been decreasing demand brought overall, global economic picture, our increasing expenses on the labor side and all those things. We have to do things differently to many, many factors. And so you will see some of that thrust here for the next few months as far as the initiatives. Some of the value of those initiatives will be there, but still, again, there's a lagging effect. But no, there's no one standing by here just waiting for these things to clear up and hopefully, it will get better. We've got to take some action."

Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter, and we're working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. Now I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much on that international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity adjustments that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That 1/2 point drop from our previous guidance is all international. So one is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summer time for trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but they've put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiative to move capacity into right places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability. Given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM improvement as we go through the year."

But clearly as we shift from regional to mainline, you'll see a continued drop in regional expense. Some of that, though, is going to be offset by the increased cost of the regional flying as they have -- the regional airlines have their own pressures that they have to deal with, and that becomes more expensive flying. But generally, with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense. I would just add to that. As we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have Economy Plus. They don't have a first-class cabin, and we continue to see great upsell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economies there, plus sales."

I will say about the Pacific is also impacted, but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange, and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. So we believe, even in that entity, that we'll continue to close -- move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, San -- Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities. But you think about San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first nonstop market to the U.S. just from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30, off to a great start, and that make 2 high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion, we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent.

Hey, Hunter, yes, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that, by definition, is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, and -- which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you were referring to seat share and so forth. That's a result of those competition's large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets, drives more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs, and we think that, that hub structure works for us really well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high-yield flow traffic versus low-yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive actual stage length now."

With respect to the fleet, when we look at your fleet and how it's evolved, it looks like, versus the last update, there is a larger reduction in this number of CRJ-700s. And as I think about it, I would have maybe anticipated a bigger decline in 50-seaters rather than 70-seaters. I'm just curious if that reduction is a function of the fact that you're bringing in a lot of 175s, the Embraer aircraft, and maybe that you're up against scope, and so as 175s come in, you've got to take out CRJ-700. So if you could just provide an explanation for that, that'd be great."

We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat-to-positive RASM in the domestic -- consolidate domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the trans-Atlantic. The one area that we'll probably lag it, because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro. So we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. We have a good path to it. We understand the importance of PRASM and what it means to drive in top line revenue, and the team's very much focused on it."

One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know,",328,"Sure, Savi. Let me talk about leasing first. I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That's raise a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically, they haven't been able to do that. They're better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us, but that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work, a situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenor. Think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every 2 or 3 years, leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we book at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years, and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So whether it's a lease, whether we use WTCs or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit",544,"Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit ever. 
We achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion and hard work of United's aviation professionals. I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make and people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology communities.
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them, like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilots, dispatchers and the IAM representative work groups all ratify contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you've heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members, and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to -- the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"
309845,331140953,963283,"United Continental Holdings, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","United Airlines Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. In",627,"Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. 
As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat-to-positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high-opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a 0.5-point reduction from our previous full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

Good morning, everyone. A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11.

A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are in a loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreements. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2 737s and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer E175s to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger, 2-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into larger-gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, in the first quarter, solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

Those are a little bit more competitive than others, but as you -- as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do. And so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on 3 areas of strategic focus. Certainly, we need to win on revenue, and it's just not markets and scheduling price but its products and service. Execution, which we're doing a good job already. Reliability, certainly. Productivity, we just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost, of course, is included in that. And then technology, which we haven't talked about, and we look forward to sharing some of that in June. And then -- and this -- people, they always kind of wink at me when we say this, but winning on trust with our employees and then speaking to them and then through to our customers, and of course, invariably to you as shareowners.

So we believe that over the long term, that, that capacity demand will come in line. What we are excited about is that our uniqueness as to how we're participating in China. It's unique in the sense that it's, as Oscar mentioned, 2 new secondary cities in China. That growth that I mentioned out of China, after that will come from secondary cities. But the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at an early, early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we'll be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments, we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter."

I think we've been outstanding by a little bit too much, know exactly what that means and how we do it thoughtfully and from a shareholder sort of value-creating perspective, is the work we're beginning to do. Interestingly enough, I have a couple of new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But no, it definitely has to change. Accepting the same thing comes to me over and over, especially in this market -- there have been decreasing demand brought overall, global economic picture, our increasing expenses on the labor side and all those things. We have to do things differently to many, many factors. And so you will see some of that thrust here for the next few months as far as the initiatives.

Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter, and we're working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. Now I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much on that international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity adjustments that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That 1/2 point drop from our previous guidance is all international. So one is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summer time for trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but they've put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiative to move capacity into right places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability. Given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM improvement as we go through the year."

But clearly as we shift from regional to mainline, you'll see a continued drop in regional expense. Some of that, though, is going to be offset by the increased cost of the regional flying as they have -- the regional airlines have their own pressures that they have to deal with, and that becomes more expensive flying. But generally, with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense. I would just add to that. As we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have Economy Plus. They don't have a first-class cabin, and we continue to see great upsell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economies there, plus sales."

I will say about the Pacific is also impacted, but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange, and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. So we believe, even in that entity, that we'll continue to close -- move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, San -- Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities. But you think about San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first nonstop market to the U.S. just from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30, off to a great start, and that make 2 high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion, we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent.

It'll bring us closer together in some sales initiatives that allows us to understand the marketplace, and we think that will enhance our connections through the market as we build, not only Beijing, but as we build in some of the secondary cities.

Hey, Hunter, yes, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that, by definition, is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, and -- which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you were referring to seat share and so forth. That's a result of those competition's large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets, drives more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs, and we think that, that hub structure works for us really well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high-yield flow traffic versus low-yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive actual stage length now."

We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat-to-positive RASM in the domestic -- consolidate domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the trans-Atlantic. The one area that we'll probably lag it, because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro. So we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. We have a good path to it. We understand the importance of PRASM and what it means to drive in top line revenue, and the team's very much focused on it."

I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That's raise a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically, they haven't been able to do that. They're better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us, but that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work, a situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenor. Think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every 2 or 3 years, leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we book at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years, and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So whether it's a lease, whether we use WTCs or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

We achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion and hard work of United's aviation professionals. I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make and people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology communities.
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them, like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilots, dispatchers and the IAM representative work groups all ratify contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you've heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members, and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to -- the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. In",627,"Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. 
As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat-to-positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high-opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a 0.5-point reduction from our previous full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

Good morning, everyone. A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which",659,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are in a loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreements. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2 737s and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer E175s to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger, 2-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into larger-gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, in the first quarter, solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

Those are a little bit more competitive than others, but as you -- as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do. And so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on 3 areas of strategic focus. Certainly, we need to win on revenue, and it's just not markets and scheduling price but its products and service. Execution, which we're doing a good job already. Reliability, certainly. Productivity, we just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost, of course, is included in that. And then technology, which we haven't talked about, and we look forward to sharing some of that in June. And then -- and this -- people, they always kind of wink at me when we say this, but winning on trust with our employees and then speaking to them and then through to our customers, and of course, invariably to you as shareowners.

So we believe that over the long term, that, that capacity demand will come in line. What we are excited about is that our uniqueness as to how we're participating in China. It's unique in the sense that it's, as Oscar mentioned, 2 new secondary cities in China. That growth that I mentioned out of China, after that will come from secondary cities. But the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at an early, early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we'll be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments, we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter."

Interestingly enough, I have a couple of new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But no, it definitely has to change.

Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter, and we're working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. Now I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much on that international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity adjustments that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That 1/2 point drop from our previous guidance is all international. So one is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summer time for trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but they've put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiative to move capacity into right places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability. Given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM improvement as we go through the year."

I just have a question about in the first quarter, the decline in regional capacity purchase expense. As you shift more capacity to the mainline from the regionals, shouldn't that expense line actually decline further? And how should we think about the mix between mainline and regional revenue given that your mainline revenue declined more than regional for the first quarter, and maybe that should have been more balanced?"

But clearly as we shift from regional to mainline, you'll see a continued drop in regional expense. Some of that, though, is going to be offset by the increased cost of the regional flying as they have -- the regional airlines have their own pressures that they have to deal with, and that becomes more expensive flying. But generally, with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense. I would just add to that. As we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have Economy Plus. They don't have a first-class cabin, and we continue to see great upsell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economies there, plus sales."

I will say about the Pacific is also impacted, but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange, and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. So we believe, even in that entity, that we'll continue to close -- move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, San -- Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities. But you think about San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first nonstop market to the U.S. just from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30, off to a great start, and that make 2 high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion, we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent. We'll keep traffic capacity and demand and make sure that we're keeping them in line, but also remembering that we're -- the international is off to a longer-term play that we're really excited about."

Hey, Hunter, yes, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that, by definition, is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, and -- which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you were referring to seat share and so forth. That's a result of those competition's large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets, drives more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs, and we think that, that hub structure works for us really well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high-yield flow traffic versus low-yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive actual stage length now."

We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat-to-positive RASM in the domestic -- consolidate domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the trans-Atlantic. The one area that we'll probably lag it, because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro.

I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That's raise a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically, they haven't been able to do that. They're better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us, but that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work, a situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenor. Think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every 2 or 3 years, leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we book at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years, and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So whether it's a lease, whether we use WTCs or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

For the first quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $688 million, excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter of pretax profit ever. 
We achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.23, excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know, we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock. 
As I think back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance, which, again, showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year, and we had 3,600 fewer cancelations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion and hard work of United's aviation professionals. I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly as they work through this winter season. This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make and people, processes and systems, we are positioned for even greater success in the months ahead. 
On the commercial side of the business, we launched our global performance guarantee, which makes our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation. 
With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach. 
We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first-ever nonstop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. 
We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel nonstop from the West Coast, connecting 2 of the world's most influential technology communities.
Now having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We're making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them, like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction, as you know, have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements, along with other commercial initiatives, will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year. 
Now turning to our people. As I've said many times, reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We've already made great progress as our pilots, dispatchers and the IAM representative work groups all ratify contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians, and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen. 
Lastly, as you've heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the 2 new board members, and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to -- the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?"

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%.

As you can see on Slide 6, through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined to 7.4%. The 4 primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations. 
In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings. 
Turning to the second quarter. We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%. 
While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lap some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. 
For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness. While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. 
As can be seen on Slide 7, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. 
While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwinds to United of approximately 2.5 points. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with the focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer-term success. 
In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize on changing demand patterns, introducing entry-level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution, launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving liability and further rolling out 2-cabin service in top business markets. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat-to-positive in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to the international markets, we expect lapping PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. 
While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. 
Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time and surcharges and a strong U.S. dollar continue to impact our performance. 
In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high-opportunity markets like China. 
We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil and the Middle East. And as you can see, on Slide 9, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a 0.5-point reduction from our previous full year capacity guidance. 
In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continue to generate high levels of profitability despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and will continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on Slide 11. 
Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes. 
Pretax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher nonfuel expense. Our pretax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly, when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year. 
Details on our fuel expense, which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year, are shown on Slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses. 
Looking forward, while we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we are still 12% hedged for the remaining 9 months of 2016, and as of yesterday, are in a loss position of approximately $80 million, including premium expense. 
Moving to Slide 13. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. We continue to manage air cost to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline. For the second quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we now expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion. These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. 
Our guidance also includes the impact of the 3 recently ratified labor agreements. We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the 3 contracts to be approximately 0.75-point CASM. 
Based on the guidance we had provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of 3 787s, 2 737s and 1 used A319, and we added 6 Embraer E175s to our original fleet. 
We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger, 2-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft and into larger-gauge Dreamliner aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of upgauging and reducing departures. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide-body aircrafts to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s as the 747's cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx capacity or total fleet size. 
Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% per shares outstanding. 
Based on the progress we've made to date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year. 
In conclusion, we showed, once again, in the first quarter, solid cost discipline on investing our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

Those are a little bit more competitive than others, but as you -- as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do. And so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on 3 areas of strategic focus. Certainly, we need to win on revenue, and it's just not markets and scheduling price but its products and service. Execution, which we're doing a good job already. Reliability, certainly. Productivity, we just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost, of course, is included in that.

It's unique in the sense that it's, as Oscar mentioned, 2 new secondary cities in China. That growth that I mentioned out of China, after that will come from secondary cities. But the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at an early, early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we'll be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments, we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter."

Interestingly enough, I have a couple of new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But no, it definitely has to change. Accepting the same thing comes to me over and over, especially in this market -- there have been decreasing demand brought overall, global economic picture, our increasing expenses on the labor side and all those things. We have to do things differently to many, many factors. And so you will see some of that thrust here for the next few months as far as the initiatives.

Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter, and we're working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. Now I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much on that international side, in particular, and we've made some capacity adjustments that's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That 1/2 point drop from our previous guidance is all international. So one is to react to the market out there on the international side and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through -- particularly, it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in trans-Atlantic, we see strong bookings in the summer time for trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter, our capacity to the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacity to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up. Very strong margins but they've put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiative to move capacity into right places as well as to drive the initiatives. And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability. Given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve, and we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM improvement as we go through the year."

But generally, with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense. I would just add to that. As we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have Economy Plus. They don't have a first-class cabin, and we continue to see great upsell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economies there, plus sales."

I think Pacific is, quite frankly, the biggest sequential driver on unit revenue impact to us. And as I mentioned, we'll -- as I mentioned, some of the capacity reduction, actually all of that 0.5-point reduction in guidance is on the international. So we'll stay really focused on the demand environment relative to capacity we have. I will say about the Pacific is also impacted, but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange, and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific, so we'll lap some of that. So we believe, even in that entity, that we'll continue to close -- move toward a flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, San -- Oscar mentioned, through the secondary cities. But you think about San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first nonstop market to the U.S. just from Singapore. San Fran-Auckland, building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30, off to a great start, and that make 2 high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion, we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent. We'll keep traffic capacity and demand and make sure that we're keeping them in line, but also remembering that we're -- the international is off to a longer-term play that we're really excited about."

That will bring us closer together in marketing. It'll bring us closer together in some sales initiatives that allows us to understand the marketplace, and we think that will enhance our connections through the market as we build, not only Beijing, but as we build in some of the secondary cities. So we can increase the connecting opportunities that we have with Air China. We connect close to 200 a day over the Air China network in Beijing today, and we think there's upside building that relationship.

And given that or a change in that, wouldn't it just be unreasonable to assume that you have any possibility of closing the margin gap, particularly now that your costs are going to be higher. And shouldn't we just expect this margin gap to be permanently structural, if for no other reason than the stage length alone?"

Hey, Hunter, yes, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have 2 east-west coast hubs that, by definition, is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time in that international flying. Our hubs are also very business-centric markets, and -- which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you were referring to seat share and so forth. That's a result of those competition's large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets, drives more competition and by definition, drives more stage length. So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs, and we think that, that hub structure works for us really well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. It allows us to make revenue management decisions on high-yield flow traffic versus low-yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive actual stage length now."

We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat-to-positive RASM in the domestic -- consolidate domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the flat Latin American PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the trans-Atlantic. The one area that we'll probably lag it, because of things that are --- particularly, the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, it's relative -- the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, for lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro.

Yes, it's no longer for us a hedging in the near-term volatility. That's a very expensive insurance policy that we can just stop, ensure that risk. So it's just one tool. There are a number of factors that we'll look at, including our net exposure to fuel. One of the benefits of the Houston hub working the other way, that as fuel prices rise, there's a correlation on revenue particularly in Houston. So it would be that net exposure that we would focus on, the competitive landscape, what others are doing that could impact the industry and the overall economic environment. So we'll be thoughtful about our hedging. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have not done any hedging since last summer. And while there's been some volatility in fuel recently, from a historical perspective, it's still a very low-fuel environment."

I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft, but it's got to make economic sense. And there are a number of factors, but let me give you 3. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt. As you know, we can finance -- debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That's raise a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically, they haven't been able to do that. They're better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us, but that's one factor. Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work, a situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenor. Think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every 2 or 3 years, leasing has to make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive. So when we book at these aircraft, these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep very long term, 25, 30 years, and leasing can get expensive. But that's not to say leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space. But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So whether it's a lease, whether we use WTCs or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program."

Although as we look the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress and as we continue to execute against our global operation better than our company has actually has ever seen and at the same time, delivering solid financial performance. 
As you can see on the chart for the second quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $1.4 billion and achieved pretax margins of 14.5%, those are both excluding special items. 
For the quarter, we earned $2.61 in diluted earnings per share, which once adjusted for taxes, represent a 25% increase year-over-year.  We delivered this result while improving our initial expectations. 
So we've clearly accomplished a lot and I'm proud of the hard work of the United team. So let me give you -- I manage to thank all our employees for their continued dedication on to providing a positive, reliable experience for our customers.  This can be seen in our operation continue to perform at a high-level last quarter with on time performance, improving over 11 points year-over-year. And on the heels of our best ever 6 months run long time arrivals [indiscernible] we are now consistently performing at the level that we and our customers expect of us. Our focus is now shifted to maintaining this level of reliability, while doing so more efficiently. 
We also completed an important milestone and our labor negotiations by leveraging joint tender of agreement with our flight attendants. 
[indiscernible] If ratified, this agreement will bring our 20,000-plus flight attendants on to a single contract, leaving the inefficiencies we have experienced over the last several years and most importantly, this will be the important step in unifying our airline to one shared purpose to be the airline we know we can be. 
I want to extend a special thank you to the FAA for their dedication and effort in reaching this agreement. And as we speak, the flight attendants are participating in roadshows and submitting their votes, and we look forward to seeing the results in mid-August. 
Speaking of our flight attendants, training is already underway with them in many of our other employees in preparation for the December launch of our new United Polaris business class. Construction is already started on the first Polaris launch in Chicago, production has also started in our new suite life seats and the first wave of our [indiscernible] menus are being finalized. 
The experience we're creating, as you know, is exactly what our customers have asked for, and we can't wait for you to enjoy it yourselves, starting on the 1st of December. 
Now back to the quarter. Although we also continued repurchasing our stock, spending approximately $700 million, representing a little over 4% of our shares outstanding and as we announced yesterday, our Board has approved an additional acquisition for $2 billion. 
As many of you have heard me say, I believe in proof not promise. As you can see, this quarter, we had many proof points that we are continuing to build a greater airline. However, as we mentioned on our June investor call, this is not enough and we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing in financial perspective to [indiscernible] to our and your expectations, and we're not standing still. As can be seen on Slide 5 in our June call, we laid out a description of initiatives we are currently implementing and are expected to drive over $3 billion in benefit by 2018. 
In our [indiscernible] presentation, I encourage you to go to our website and download it. 
We expect these initiatives to contribute to driving incremental value and shrinking our margin down to peers.  We'll keep you updated on the cost -- progress of these issues. 
And we're not stopping there. We're currently in the middle of a thorough self-evaluation of all assets of our business. 
In particular, as shown on Slide 6, we are working to identify ways to operate our airline more efficiently now than top tier reliability. 
We're also refining initiatives of each geographic region, hub and [indiscernible]. 
Additionally, we are implementing the profit maximizing product and segmentation strategy that best aligns with our customers. And finally, we have cost kept to our peers that we are identifying and addressing those cost control.  I'm looking forward to presenting this next chapter of United at our fourth quarter Investor Day. 
But before I turn it over the call over to Jim, I'd like to speak to our future capacity plans. 
Let me start by saying we have acknowledge, truly acknowledge the importance of returning to positive unit revenue and of course, we recognize that our future capacity plans join the impact of future positive performance. 
However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization and sustainable earnings we obtain. At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best-performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive. However, we determined that certain flags will not generate sustained profitability. We will then carefully consider modifying that capacity. 
Proof of our result is seen in us, again, reducing full year capacity 0.25 points. We've now reduced our 2016 capacity growth plans by 0.75 points. This is a meaningful demonstration of our responsibility to the present demand environment, particularly given that our initial guidance has always been responsively and conservatively constructive. 
Our review and analysis wont stop here as we continue to closely evaluate future changes. 
Going forward, as we adjust our capacity, we tend to update shareowners on this modifications. 
So to wrap up, again, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter and their continued focus on our customers. I continue to spend a lot of time visiting stations and I can't be more proud of the work they're all doing. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

With respect to",446,"Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international  yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives. 
With respect to the third quarter, we expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year with domestic and international PRASM to be in both same ranges. 
On Slide 8, we define each of the major headwinds we anticipate for the third quarter, summing to approximately 3.5 points of drag on PRASM. 
I'd now like to explain what we are seeing in the current demand environment. Leisure bookings have been strong as travelers are taking advantage of attractive fair levels and the strong U.S. dollar. Corporate travel bookings in the second quarter were essentially flat with revenue down approximately 3% and corporate yields continue to be pressured. 
Looking forward towards the rest of the year, we expect to see further softening of corporate deals as summer leisure travel subsides. We will closely monitor this FX as they impact our close in yield high-yield revenue. 
On our April earnings call, we provided an outlook for fourth quarter PRASM, and I'd like to update you on that today. 
Due to downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP as well as a growing concern in the pace of corporate yield recovery, our fourth quarter estimates have been revised downward. 
In response, as you have seen from our announcement yesterday, we are reducing second half capacity to better align with demand. 
On Slide 9, we show specific actions we have taken in each geographic entity. I'll let you read through the details on your own, but rest assured, we are actively managing our network to optimize results in a challenging revenue environment and are seeing the results. 
For instance, as a result of our capacity reallocation, Houston had the best year-over-year PRASM of any hub in June, followed closely by San Francisco and Denver. 
Taking all these regional dynamics into account with respect to capacity as can be seen on Slide 10, we now anticipate full year capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5%. 
As Oscar mentioned, we are currently in the process of closely evaluating our capacity for the fourth quarter and 2017. 
As I wrap up, I want to reiterate our focus on maximizing profitability throughout our entire network. We are constantly evaluating the revenue and profitability landscape to ensure we have the proper plan in place. We continue to be committed to growing our capacity in line with demand, but remain willing and prepared to adjust when necessary. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance can be seen on Slide 12 for GAAP financials and Slide 13 for non-GAAP financials. 
Excluding special items, pretax earnings were $1.4 billion, with a pretax margin of 14.5%. 
Importantly, our earnings per share were $2.61, a 25% improvement year-over-year when adjusted for taxes as we continue to repurchase shares. 
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit cost for the quarter were 2.5% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. 
For the third quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5% and for the full year, we continue to expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3% despite reducing capacity by almost 1 point versus initial expectations. 
This guidance includes the benefit of our annual efficiency savings initiatives from our 2013 cost-savings program as well as our recently announced 2016 program. 
In total, we expect these 2 programs to drive $400 million of cost benefit when compared to 2015. 
This [indiscernible] guidance also includes the impact from the 3 ratified labor agreements reached this year, but does not include any assumption associated with the sensitive agreement we recently reached with our flight attendants. Once ratified, we will provide more specifics on the impact our costs. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for revenue and cost, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13.5% and 15.5% for the third quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the second quarter, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 15, during the quarter, we invested approximately $770 million in the business and took delivery of 2 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 2 737-800 aircraft. 
As Oscar mentioned, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our shares in the quarter.  As of the end of the second quarter, we still have approximately $255 million remaining on our prior $3 billion authorization. 
Additionally, as announced yesterday, our Board has approved a new $2 billion share authorization. 
Returning cash to our shareholders is a core element of our capital allocation strategy. However, this will not be done at the expense of the health of our balance sheet as maintaining manageable debt levels is critical to running the airlines through a variety of economic cycles. 
In conclusion, throughout the quarter, we have continue to demonstrate strong cost difference discipline, a commitment to invest in our business and a desire to reward our shareholders. We believe the plan we have in place position us well to continue these actions going forward, while allowing us to be nimble and responsive to changing economic environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

Gerald one thing I talked before about looking at free cash flow net of aircraft financing. We had this discussion at whether we choose the least aircraft or buy aircraft that's making sure difference in free cash flow. So we are now looking at cash and cash allocation, I do take that into account. And we can to finalize our plan for financing closer to the start of the year, but just kind of looking at where our aircraft CapEx next year is and kind of what we did this year, I think it's reasonable to assume -- have the range of about 1/2 to 2/3 of our aircraft CapEx being financed year. So probably part of that it could be little bit less, it could be a little bit more depending on interest rates, but in the current interest rate environment, as you've seen us and others do, the capital markets are quite attractive. So that's one level we have, sort of depending on the environment, how much of our aircraft CapEx is financed. In terms of other levers, we can always dial down non-aircraft CapEx. We had reasonable experience doing that. Aircraft CapEx, the only comment I would make is that it tends to be the case that when a manufacturer is building an aircraft, they expect to take it, and they tend to start cutting that all, call it 18 months, 15 months [ph] ahead of schedule. So you clearly much walk in most of the years aircraft sort of not now within the next few months. But you can't do a lot with aircraft beyond that, and we've done that in the past when necessary."

I think as we look out and as I mentioned fourth quarter, our expectations given expectations of demand is measured by GDP declining, we expect, obviously, that to continue. But the corporate business, although we see the demand flat, the revenue is down on lower yield, we expect that to continue that's core related to that expectations of GDP coming down, so that's part of it that's what's driving it. So that's domestic piece of our ability putting pressure on our ability that I talked about in our April call. Internationally, we did see weakness in trans-Atlantic PRASM in the second quarter. We're adjusting to that. On our slide we, talked about fourth quarter being down 1% to 2% capacity. So we r reacting to that. Our capacity was up about 2% in the second quarter. We are guiding to 0.6 to 1.6 in the third, and we're guiding to down 1 to 2, so we're addressing some of that demand on the trans-Atlantic side aligning that capacity with demand. Latin, we actually -- that's the one where we actually see the quarter-over-quarter improvement on a RASM basis stronger than the other entities, and so we feel good about where the RASM entities heading as we head into the fourth quarter. On the Pacific side, it's really from a demand perspective a lot of things we talked about in the past with capacity. I will say, our launches of our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectations. We're securely proud. I would jump back in trans-Atlantic on this, but our San Fran-Tel Aviv play is doing exceptionally well. But our Asia flights are all meeting and exceeding our expectations. But the demand, there's still only capacity demand. We are starting -- we have an opportunity to San Fran-Shanghai in October, so we're seeing a little bit of capacity on that, but we think that over the long run, that's the right investment for us to make."

We've talked about surcharges over time and so forth being down and that correlation in terms of how fuels affected revenue. So some of that -- because I do agree in 2015, you're right. Industry revenue as a percent of GDP was down and inflection point from previous years. And I expect that will continue, again, today. And so other than correlation, that fuel back to the other thing we've talked about, right? We have seen capacity grow faster than demand, and that's putting pressure on yields and corporate demand is not growing at the pace, the high corp yields, corporate demand is not growing at that pace of capacity. We're pretty consistent. I mean, we're back to our initial year guidance of capacity, and we're down from that initial year guidance of capacity, and that capacity even though we're guiding today will be less than what expectations of GDP today that we're talking to. So we're managing our plan in this environment, and we feel pretty good about it. The last thing I would say is that on the June call we talked about our [indiscernible] up gauge program. We have some modest growth in the third quarter. That capacity comes really margin accretive, and so where leisure bookings are strong, that will lead capacity to absorb that leisure bookings. Lower RASM but extremely lower cost CASM. So really about the plans we're rolling out."

And the other piece is that modest -- in that modest capacity growth we have, if you look at our domestic, will actually be slightly down in departures in the third quarter to drive that large capacity growth. That said, margin-accretive initiatives that we talked about in June giving a little bit more whole as we go through the year, so that little line growth and the upgauge strategy becoming less dependent on the regional and more dependent on the mainline, again, it offers us product first class and the economy plus, but it does come in RASM that's lower than the average that are even lower CASM, which make it margin-accretive.

Although, as we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress, and thus, we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever see",994,"Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us today. 
Although, as we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress, and thus, we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever seen, and at the same time, delivering solid financial performance. 
As you can see on the chart for the second quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $1.4 billion and achieved pretax margin of 14.5%. Those are both excluding special items. 
For the quarter, we earned $2.61 in diluted earnings per share, which, once adjusted for taxes, represent a 25% increase year-over-year.  And we delivered this result while improving on our initial expectations. 
So we've clearly accomplished a lot, and I'm proud of the hard work of the United team. So let me give you a -- give me a minute to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication to providing a positive, reliable experience for our customers. This can be seen as our operations continue to perform at a high-level last quarter with on-time performance, improving over 11 points year-over-year. And on the heels of our best ever 6-month run and on-time arrivals and [indiscernible], we are now consistently performing at the level that we and our customers expect of us. Our focus has now shifted to maintaining this level of reliability while doing so more efficiently. 
We also completed an important milestone in our labor negotiations by reaching a tentative joint agreement with our flight attendants. And if ratified, this agreement will bring our 20,000-plus flight attendants onto a single contract, relieving the inefficiencies we have experienced over the last several years. And most importantly, this will be an important step in unifying our airline to one shared purpose to be the airline we know we can be. I want to extend a special thank you to the AFA for their dedication and effort in reaching this agreement. As we speak, the flight attendants are participating in roadshows and submitting their votes, and we look forward to seeing the results in mid-August. 
Speaking of our flight attendants, training is already underway with them and many of our other employees in preparation for the December launch of our new United Polaris business class. Construction has already started on the first Polaris launch in Chicago. Production has also started on our new suite-like seats, and the first wave of our chef-inspired menus are being finalized. The experience we're creating, as you know, is exactly what our customers have asked for. And we can't wait for you to enjoy it yourselves, starting on the 1st of December. 
Now back to the quarter. We also continued repurchasing our stock, spending approximately $700 million, representing a little bit over 4% of our shares outstanding. And as we announced yesterday, our Board has approved an additional authorization for $2 billion. 
As many of you have heard me say, I believe in proof not promise. As you can see this quarter, we had many proof points that we are continuing to build a great airline. However, as we mentioned on our June investor call, this is not enough. And we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing in the financial perspective to the level of our and your expectations, and we're not standing still. As can be seen on Slide 5 on our June call, we laid out a description of initiatives we are currently implementing and are expected to drive over $3 billion of benefit by 2018. 
Now it's in our June presentation. I encourage you to go to our website and download it. 
We expect these initiatives to contribute to driving incremental value and shrinking our margin down to peers. We'll keep you updated on the cost -- progress of these issues. 
And we're not stopping there. We are currently in the middle of a thorough self-evaluation of all assets of our business. In particular, as shown on Slide 6, we are working to identify ways to operate our airline more efficiently now than top tier reliability. We are also refining the mission of each geographic region, hub and spoke. Additionally, we are implementing the profit maximizing product and segmentation strategy that best aligns with our customers. And finally, we have a cost gap to our peers that we are identifying and addressing those costs under control.  I'm looking forward to presenting this next chapter of United at our fourth quarter Investor Day. 
But before I turn over the call over to Jim, I'd like to speak to our future capacity plans. 
Let me start by saying we acknowledge, truly acknowledge the importance of returning to positive unit revenue, and of course, we recognize that our future capacity plans join the impact of future process and performance. However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization and sustainability of earnings is maintained. At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best-performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive. However, we determined that certain flags will not generate sustained profitability. We will then carefully consider modifying that capacity. 
Proof of our result is seen in us, again, reducing full year capacity, 0.25 points. We have now reduced our 2016 capacity growth plans by 0.75 points. This is a meaningful demonstration of our responsiveness to the present demand environment, particularly given that our initial guidance had always been responsively and conservatively been constructive. 
Our review and analysis won't stop here as we continue to closely evaluate future changes. Going forward, as we adjust our capacity, we tend to update share owners on these modifications. 
So to wrap up, again, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter and their continued focus on our customers. I continue to spend a lot of time visiting stations, and I can't be more proud of the work they're all doing. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives.

As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives. 
With respect to the third quarter, we expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year with domestic and international PRASM to be in both same ranges. 
On Slide 8, we define each of the major headwinds we anticipate for the third quarter, summing to approximately 3.5 points of drag on PRASM. 
I'd now like to explain what we are seeing in the current demand environment. Leisure bookings have been strong as travelers are taking advantage of attractive fair levels and a strong U.S. dollar. Corporate travel bookings in the second quarter were essentially flat with revenue down approximately 3%, and corporate yields continue to be pressured. Looking towards the rest of the year, we expect to see further softening of corporate yields as summer leisure travel subsides. We will closely monitor these effects as they impact our close-in yield/high-yield revenue. 
On our April earnings call, we provided an outlook for fourth quarter PRASM, and I'd like to update you on that today. Due to downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP as well as a growing concern in the pace of corporate yield recovery, our fourth quarter estimates have been revised downward. In response, as you have seen from our announcement yesterday, we are reducing the second half capacity to better align with demand. 
On Slide 9, we show specific actions we are taking in each geographic entity. I'll let you read through the details on your own, but rest assured, we are actively managing our network to optimize results in a challenging revenue environment and are seeing the results. For instance, as a result of our capacity reallocation, Houston had the best year-over-year PRASM of any hub in June, followed closely by San Francisco and Denver. 
Taking all these regional dynamics into account with respect to capacity, as can be seen on Slide 10, we now anticipate full year capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5%. 
As Oscar mentioned, we are currently in the process of closely evaluating our capacity for the fourth quarter and 2017. 
As I wrap up, I want to reiterate our focus on maximizing profitability throughout our entire network. We are constantly evaluating the revenue and profitability landscape to ensure we have the proper plan in place. We continue to be committed to growing our capacity in line with demand, but remain willing and prepared to adjust when necessary. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance can be seen on Slide 12 for GAAP financials and Slide 13 for non-GAAP financials. 
Excluding special items, pretax earnings were $1.4 billion, with a pretax margin of 14.5%. Importantly, our earnings per share were $2.61, a 25% improvement year-over-year when adjusted for taxes as we continue to repurchase shares. 
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs for the quarter were 2.5% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. 
For the third quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3% despite reducing capacity by almost 1 point versus initial expectations. 
This guidance includes the benefit of our annual efficiency savings initiatives from our 2013 cost-savings program as well as our recently announced 2016 program. In total, we expect these 2 programs to drive $400 million of cost benefit when compared to 2015. This CASM guidance also includes the impact from the 3 ratified labor agreements reached this year but does not include any assumptions associated with the tentative agreement we recently reached with our flight attendants. Once ratified, we will provide more specifics on the impact to our costs. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for revenue and cost, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13.5% and 15.5% for the third quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the second quarter, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 15, during the quarter, we invested approximately $770 million in the business and took delivery of 2 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 2 737-800 aircraft. 
As Oscar mentioned, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our shares in the quarter.  As of the end of the second quarter, we still have approximately $255 million remaining on our prior $3 billion authorization. Additionally, as announced yesterday, our Board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. 
Returning cash to our shareholders is a core element of our capital allocation strategy. However, this will not be done at the expense of the health of our balance sheet as maintaining manageable debt levels is critical to running the airline through a variety of economic cycles. 
In conclusion, throughout the quarter, we have continued to demonstrate strong cost discipline, a commitment to invest in our business and a desire to reward our shareholders. We believe the plan we have in place positions us well to continue these actions going forward while allowing us to be nimble and responsive to a changing economic environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

We've had this discussion whether we choose to lease aircraft or buy aircraft. That can make them sure of difference in free cash flow, so we're now looking at cash and cash allocation. I do take that into account, and we tend to finalize our plan for aircraft financing closer to the start of the year. But just kind of looking at where our aircraft CapEx next year is and kind of what we did this year, I think it's reasonable to assume, have a range of about 1/2 to 2/3 of our aircraft CapEx being financed year. So you could probably plug that into your -- and this could be a little bit less, it could be a little bit more depending on interest rates. But in the current interest rate environment, as you've seen us and others do, the capital markets are quite attractive. So that's one lever we have, sort of depending on the environment, how much of our aircraft CapEx is financed. Now in terms of other levers, we can always dial down non-aircraft CapEx. We had reasonable experience doing that. Aircraft CapEx, the only comment I would make is that it tends to be the case that when a manufacturer is building an aircraft, they expect you to take it. And they tend to start cutting that, call it 18 months, 15 months ahead of schedule. So you pretty much walk in most of the years of the aircraft, sort of not now, within the next few months. So -- but you can do a lot with aircraft beyond that, and we've done that in the past when necessary."

We're seeing our local share in our hubs rebounding back to levels that we saw before some of our integration issues, and so we're really, really excited about it.

I think as we look out and as I mentioned the fourth quarter, our expectations given -- expectations of demand is measured by GDP declining, we expect, obviously, that to continue. The corporate business, although we see the demand flat, the revenue is down on lower yield, we expect that to continue. That's correlated to the expectations of GDP coming down so that's -- a part of it was driving it. So that's domestic piece of our ability, putting pressure on our ability that I talked about on our April call. Internationally, we did see weakness in trans-Atlantic PRASM in the second quarter. We're adjusting to that. And found on our slide, we talked about the fourth quarter being down 1% to 2% of capacity. So we're reacting to that. Our capacity was up about 2% in the second quarter. We're guiding to 0.6% to 1.6% in the third, and we're guiding to down 1% to 2%. So we're addressing some of that demand on the trans-Atlantic side, aligning in that capacity with demand. Latin, we actually -- that's the one where we actually see the quarter-over-quarter improvement on a RASM basis stronger than some of the other entities, and so we feel good about where the Latin entity is heading as we head into the fourth quarter. On the Pacific side, it's really from a demand perspective, a lot of the things we talked about in the past was OA capacity. I will say, our launches of our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectations. We're particularly proud. I would jump back to the trans-Atlantic on this. But our San Fran-Tel Aviv play is doing exceptionally well. But our Asia flights are all meeting and exceeding our expectations. So -- but the demand, there is still OA capacity demand. We are starting -- we have an opportunity to start San Fran-Shanghai #2 in October, so we're seeing a little bit of capacity from on that. But we think that over the long run, that's the right investment for us to make."

We talked about surcharges over time and so forth being down and the -- and that correlation in terms of how fuels affected revenue. So some of that -- because I do agree in 2015, you're right. Industry revenue as a percent of GDP was down, and it was in an inflection point from previous years. And I expect that will continue again today. And so other than that correlation, the fuel, back to the other thing we've talked about, right, we have seen capacity grow faster than demand. And that's putting pressure on yields, and corporate demand is not growing at the pace. The high corp yields, corporate demand is not growing at that pace of capacity. We're pretty consistent. I mean, you go back to our initial year guidance on capacity, and we're down from that initial year guidance on capacity. And that capacity, even though we're guiding today, will be less than what expectations of GDP today that we're talking to. So we're managing our plan in this environment, and we feel pretty good about it. The last thing I would say is that on the June call, we talked about our slimline and upgauge program. We have some modest growth in the third quarter. That capacity becomes really margin accretive. And so where leisure bookings are strong, that's a good capacity to absorb that leisure bookings. Lower RASM, but an extremely lower-cost CASM. So we really feel good about the plan we're rolling out."

And the other piece is that modest -- in that modest capacity growth we have, if you look at our domestic, we'll actually be slightly down in departures in the third quarter to drive that modest capacity growth. That said, margin-accretive initiatives that we talked about in June, giving a little bit more hold as we go through the year, so that slimline growth and the upgauge strategy becoming less dependent on the regional and more dependent on the mainline. Again, it offers us some great product called first class and the Economy Plus. But it does come in a RASM that's lower than the average that are even lower CASM, which makes it margin-accretive.

I mean, and maybe that speaks to the point that Jamie brought up about the fact that we're sort of seeing a breakdown here between revenue and GDP.

I think pricing actions always affect PRASM, but I think it's more of a continuation of the -- what the demand that we're seeing or demands relatively flat on lower yield. The one thing -- as you move into a summer peak period and you have that leisure demand strength, it actually, with lack of better words, props up your inventory. And so your lower inventory buckets are not as open as much. One of the things we're watching as we move past that peak period of summer season and strong leisure demand, and to your point, kind the corporate demand being relatively flat, that can put more -- that can put relatively more pressure on yields relative to the quarter where you had peak demand strong from the June, July, August months. But to answer your question, we're kind of seeing demand where it was at. I would note that as energy sector continues to be down year-over-year, it's decelerating at a slower rate so that's also putting pressure on us on a year-over-year basis as we go forward."

Although, as we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress, and thus, we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever see",994,"Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us today. 
Although, as we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress, and thus, we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever seen, and at the same time, delivering solid financial performance. 
As you can see on the chart for the second quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $1.4 billion and achieved pretax margin of 14.5%. Those are both excluding special items. 
For the quarter, we earned $2.61 in diluted earnings per share, which, once adjusted for taxes, represent a 25% increase year-over-year.  And we delivered this result while improving on our initial expectations. 
So we've clearly accomplished a lot, and I'm proud of the hard work of the United team. So let me give you a -- give me a minute to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication to providing a positive, reliable experience for our customers. This can be seen as our operations continue to perform at a high-level last quarter with on-time performance, improving over 11 points year-over-year. And on the heels of our best ever 6-month run of on-time arrivals and [indiscernible], we are now consistently performing at the level that we and our customers expect of us. Our focus has now shifted to maintaining this level of reliability while doing so more efficiently. 
We also completed an important milestone in our labor negotiations by reaching a tentative joint agreement with our flight attendants. And if ratified, this agreement will bring our 20,000-plus flight attendants onto a single contract, relieving the inefficiencies we have experienced over the last several years. And most importantly, this will be an important step in unifying our airline to one shared purpose to be the airline we know we can be. I want to extend a special thank you to the AFA for their dedication and effort in reaching this agreement. As we speak, the flight attendants are participating in roadshows and submitting their votes, and we look forward to seeing the results in mid-August. 
Speaking of our flight attendants, training is already underway with them and many of our other employees in preparation for the December launch of our new United Polaris business class. Construction has already started on the first Polaris launch in Chicago. Production has also started on our new suite-like seats, and the first wave of our chef-inspired menus are being finalized. The experience we're creating, as you know, is exactly what our customers have asked for. And we can't wait for you to enjoy it yourselves, starting on the 1st of December. 
Now back to the quarter. We also continued repurchasing our stock, spending approximately $700 million, representing a little bit over 4% of our shares outstanding. And as we announced yesterday, our Board has approved an additional authorization for $2 billion. 
As many of you have heard me say, I believe in proof not promise. As you can see this quarter, we had many proof points that we are continuing to build a great airline. However, as we mentioned on our June investor call, this is not enough. And we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing in the financial perspective to the level of our and your expectations, and we're not standing still. As can be seen on Slide 5 on our June call, we laid out a description of initiatives we are currently implementing and are expected to drive over $3 billion of benefit by 2018. 
Now to see our June presentation, I encourage you to go to our website and download it. 
We expect these initiatives to contribute to driving incremental value and shrinking our margin down to peers. We'll keep you updated on the cost -- progress of these issues. 
And we're not stopping there. We are currently in the middle of a thorough self-evaluation of all assets of our business. In particular, as shown on Slide 6, we are working to identify ways to operate our airline more efficiently now than top tier reliability. We are also refining the mission of each geographic region, hub and spoke. Additionally, we are implementing the profit maximizing product and segmentation strategy that best aligns with our customers. And finally, we have a cost gap to our peers that we are identifying and addressing those costs under control.  I'm looking forward to presenting this next chapter of United at our fourth quarter Investor Day. 
But before I turn over the call over to Jim, I'd like to speak to our future capacity plans. 
Let me start by saying we acknowledge, truly acknowledge the importance of returning to positive unit revenue, and of course, we recognize that our future capacity plans directly impact of future process and performance. However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization and sustainability of earnings is maintained. At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best-performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive. However, if we determine that certain flags will not generate sustained profitability. We will then carefully consider modifying that capacity. 
Proof of our resolve is seen in us, again, reducing full year capacity, 0.25 points. We have now reduced our 2016 capacity growth plans by 0.75 points. This is a meaningful demonstration of our responsiveness to the present demand environment, particularly given that our initial guidance had always been responsibly and conservatively been constructed. 
Our review and analysis won't stop here as we continue to closely evaluate future changes. Going forward, as we adjust our capacity, we tend to update share owners on these modifications. 
So to wrap up, again, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter and their continued focus on our customers. I continue to spend a lot of time visiting stations, and I can't be more proud of the work they're all doing. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives.

As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives. 
With respect to the third quarter, we expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year with domestic and international PRASM to be in both same ranges. 
On Slide 8, we define each of the major headwinds we anticipate for the third quarter, summing to approximately 3.5 points of drag on PRASM. 
I'd now like to explain what we are seeing in the current demand environment. Leisure bookings have been strong as travelers are taking advantage of attractive fair levels and a strong U.S. dollar. Corporate travel bookings in the second quarter were essentially flat with revenue down approximately 3%, and corporate yields continue to be pressured. Looking towards the rest of the year, we expect to see further softening of corporate yields as summer leisure travel subsides. We will closely monitor these effects as they impact our close-in yield/high-yield revenue. 
On our April earnings call, we provided an outlook for fourth quarter PRASM, and I'd like to update you on that today. Due to downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP as well as a growing concern in the pace of corporate yield recovery, our fourth quarter estimates have been revised downward. In response, as you have seen from our announcement yesterday, we are reducing the second half capacity to better align with demand. 
On Slide 9, we show specific actions we are taking in each geographic entity. I'll let you read through the details on your own, but rest assured, we are actively managing our network to optimize results in a challenging revenue environment and are seeing the results. For instance, as a result of our capacity reallocation, Houston had the best year-over-year PRASM of any hub in June, followed closely by San Francisco and Denver. 
Taking all these regional dynamics into account with respect to capacity, as can be seen on Slide 10, we now anticipate full year capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5%. 
As Oscar mentioned, we are currently in the process of closely evaluating our capacity for the fourth quarter and 2017. 
As I wrap up, I want to reiterate our focus on maximizing profitability throughout our entire network. We are constantly evaluating the revenue and profitability landscape to ensure we have the proper plan in place. We continue to be committed to growing our capacity in line with demand, but remain willing and prepared to adjust when necessary. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance can be seen on Slide 12 for GAAP financials and Slide 13 for non-GAAP financials. 
Excluding special items, pretax earnings were $1.4 billion, with a pretax margin of 14.5%. Importantly, our earnings per share were $2.61, a 25% improvement year-over-year when adjusted for taxes as we continue to repurchase shares. 
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs for the quarter were 2.5% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. 
For the third quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3% despite reducing capacity by almost 1 point versus initial expectations. 
This guidance includes the benefit of our annual efficiency savings initiatives from our 2013 cost-savings program as well as our recently announced 2016 program. In total, we expect these 2 programs to drive $400 million of cost benefit when compared to 2015. This CASM guidance also includes the impact from the 3 ratified labor agreements reached this year but does not include any assumptions associated with the tentative agreement we recently reached with our flight attendants. Once ratified, we will provide more specifics on the impact to our costs. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for revenue and costs, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13.5% and 15.5% for the third quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the second quarter, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 15, during the quarter, we invested approximately $770 million in the business and took delivery of 2 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 2 737-800 aircraft. 
As Oscar mentioned, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our shares in the quarter.  As of the end of the second quarter, we still have approximately $255 million remaining on our prior $3 billion authorization. Additionally, as announced yesterday, our Board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. 
Returning cash to our shareholders is a core element of our capital allocation strategy. However, this will not be done at the expense of the health of our balance sheet as maintaining manageable debt levels is critical to running the airline through a variety of economic cycles. 
In conclusion, throughout the quarter, we have continued to demonstrate strong cost discipline, a commitment to invest in our business and a desire to reward our shareholders. We believe the plan we have in place positions us well to continue these actions going forward while allowing us to be nimble and responsive to a changing economic environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

But in the current interest rate environment, as you've seen us and others do, the capital markets are quite attractive. So that's one lever we have, sort of depending on the environment, how much of our aircraft CapEx is financed. Now in terms of other levers, we can always dial down non-aircraft CapEx. We had reasonable experience doing that. Aircraft CapEx, the only comment I would make is that it tends to be the case that when a manufacturer is building an aircraft, they expect you to take it. And they tend to start cutting that, call it 18 months, 15 months ahead of schedule. So you pretty much lock in most of the years of the aircraft, sort of, if not now, within the next few months. So -- but you can do a lot with aircraft beyond that, and we've done that in the past when necessary."

It's something that we have to do and acknowledge, and that involves management structure. It was aligned. I've always said that structure follows strategy, and so developing in the near term what our north star is, I think, in the critical point. So we do have a finite time period that we'll work through over the summer. We have a board meeting with -- on -- in September, where we'll sort of talk a lot about this.

We're seeing our local share in our hubs rebounding back to levels that we saw before some of our integration issues, and so we're really, really excited about it. And lastly, on our call in June, we talked about $300 million of operational efficiency as well as some of the -- what I call choice.

I think as we look out and as I mentioned the fourth quarter, our expectations given -- expectations of demand as measured by GDP declining, we expect, obviously, that to continue. The corporate business, although we see the demand flat, the revenue is down on lower yields, we expect that to continue. That's correlated to the expectations of GDP coming down so that's -- a part of it was driving it. So that's domestic piece of our ability, putting pressure on our ability that I talked about on our April call. Internationally, we did see weakness in trans-Atlantic PRASM in the second quarter. We're adjusting to that. On our slide, we talked about the fourth quarter being down 1% to 2% of capacity. So we're reacting to that. Our capacity was up about 2% in the second quarter. We're guiding to 0.6% to 1.6% in the third, and we're guiding to down 1% to 2%. So we're addressing some of that demand on the trans-Atlantic side, aligning in that capacity with demand. Latin, we actually -- that's the one where we actually see the quarter-over-quarter improvement on a RASM basis stronger than some of the other entities, and so we feel good about where the Latin entity is heading as we head into the fourth quarter. On the Pacific side, it's really from a demand perspective, a lot of the things we talked about in the past was OA capacity. I will say, our launches of our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectations. We're particularly proud, I'm going to jump back to the trans-Atlantic on this. But our San Fran-Tel Aviv play is doing exceptionally well. But our Asia flights are all meeting and exceeding our expectations. So -- but the demand, there is still OA capacity demand. We are starting -- we have an opportunity to start San Fran-Shanghai #2 in October, so we're seeing a little bit of capacity from that. But we think that over the long run, that's the right investment for us to make."

We talked about surcharges over time and so forth being down and the -- and that correlation in terms of how fuels affected revenue. So some of that -- because I do agree in 2015, you're right. Industry revenue as a percent of GDP was down, and it was at an inflection point from previous years. And I expect that will continue again today. And so other than that correlation to fuel, back to the other thing we've talked about, right, we have seen capacity grow faster than demand. And that's putting pressure on yields, and corporate demand is not growing at the pace. The high corp yields, corporate demand is not growing at that pace of capacity. We're pretty consistent. I mean, you go back to our initial year guidance on capacity, and we're down from that initial year guidance on capacity. And that capacity, even though we're guiding today, will be less than what expectations of GDP today that we're talking to. So we're managing our plan in this environment, and we feel pretty good about it. The last thing I would say is that on the June call, we talked about our slimline and upgauged program. We have some modest growth in the third quarter. That capacity becomes really margin accretive. And so where leisure bookings are strong, that's a good capacity to absorb that leisure bookings. Lower RASM, but an extremely lower-cost CASM. So we really feel good about the plan we're rolling out."

And the other piece is that modest -- in that modest capacity growth we have, if you look at our domestic, we'll actually be slightly down in departures in the third quarter to drive that modest capacity growth. That said, margin-accretive initiatives that we talked about in June, giving a little bit more hold as we roll through the year, so that slimline growth and the upgauge strategy becoming less dependent on the regional and more dependent on the mainline. Again, it offers us ancillary product called first class and the Economy Plus. But it does come in a RASM that's lower than the average, but an even lower CASM, which makes it margin-accretive.

I think pricing actions always affect PRASM, but I think it's more of a continuation of the -- what the demand that we're seeing or demands relatively flat on lower yield.

We talked about revenue initiatives of -- strong customer choice revenue initiatives of $2.5 billion by 2018. That entry-level fares is a piece of that, but also pieces of that as we upgauge and become less reliable on the regional carriers and introduce more first class and Economy Plus will drive other components of that sort of revenue that we have out there today. And then finally on revenue management, as I mentioned in -- on the call in June, we're in the process of moving to a new forecasting model that we call it Gemini. We are in the market.

We're there, particularly when you talk -- when you add our pension obligation. And when I talk about healthy balance sheet, it's really about managing through a cycle, and we're very comfortable that we would continue to have access to capital through a cycle. We have about $8 billion of unencumbered assets. So I'm comfortable with where our leverage is today given our business and given what we're trying to do, so we don't need to significantly introduce leverage at all. And with the additional CapEx, I expect over the next few years, I said when we raised our CapEx guidance back in March with the additional aircraft, we saw about 50 seats issued as well as the early retirement of 747s, all of those aircraft I would expect to finance. And with sort of the range I put out earlier on the call on what I expect to do next year, I think if you run the arithmetic, you would not see a decline in our gross debt number over the next year or 2."

Although, as we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress, and thus, we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever seen, and at the same time, delivering solid financial performance. 
As you can see on the chart for the second quarter, we recorded a pretax profit of $1.4 billion and achieved pretax margin of 14.5%. Those are both excluding special items. 
For the quarter, we earned $2.61 in diluted earnings per share, which, once adjusted for taxes, represent a 25% increase year-over-year.  And we delivered this result while improving on our initial expectations. 
So we've clearly accomplished a lot, and I'm proud of the hard work of the United team. So let me give you a -- give me a minute to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication to providing a positive, reliable experience for our customers. This can be seen as our operations continue to perform at a high-level last quarter with on-time performance, improving over 11 points year-over-year. And on the heels of our best ever 6-month run of on-time arrivals and [indiscernible], we are now consistently performing at the level that we and our customers expect of us. Our focus has now shifted to maintaining this level of reliability while doing so more efficiently. 
We also completed an important milestone in our labor negotiations by reaching a tentative joint agreement with our flight attendants. And if ratified, this agreement will bring our 20,000-plus flight attendants onto a single contract, relieving the inefficiencies we have experienced over the last several years. And most importantly, this will be an important step in unifying our airline to one shared purpose to be the airline we know we can be. I want to extend a special thank you to the AFA for their dedication and effort in reaching this agreement. As we speak, the flight attendants are participating in roadshows and submitting their votes, and we look forward to seeing the results in mid-August. 
Speaking of our flight attendants, training is already underway with them and many of our other employees in preparation for the December launch of our new United Polaris business class. Construction has already started on the first Polaris launch in Chicago. Production has also started on our new suite-like seats, and the first wave of our chef-inspired menus are being finalized. The experience we're creating, as you know, is exactly what our customers have asked for. And we can't wait for you to enjoy it yourselves, starting on the 1st of December. 
Now back to the quarter. We also continued repurchasing our stock, spending approximately $700 million, representing a little bit over 4% of our shares outstanding. And as we announced yesterday, our Board has approved an additional authorization for $2 billion. 
As many of you have heard me say, I believe in proof not promise. As you can see this quarter, we had many proof points that we are continuing to build a great airline. However, as we mentioned on our June investor call, this is not enough. And we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing in the financial perspective to the level of our and your expectations, and we're not standing still. As can be seen on Slide 5 on our June call, we laid out a description of initiatives we are currently implementing and are expected to drive over $3 billion of benefit by 2018. 
Now to see our June presentation, I encourage you to go to our website and download it. 
We expect these initiatives to contribute to driving incremental value and shrinking our margin down to peers. We'll keep you updated on the cost -- progress of these issues. 
And we're not stopping there. We are currently in the middle of a thorough self-evaluation of all assets of our business. In particular, as shown on Slide 6, we are working to identify ways to operate our airline more efficiently now than top-tier reliability. We are also refining the mission of each geographic region, hub and spoke. Additionally, we are implementing the profit maximizing product and segmentation strategy that best aligns with our customers. And finally, we have a cost gap to our peers that we are identifying and addressing those costs under control.  I'm looking forward to presenting this next chapter of United at our fourth quarter Investor Day. 
But before I turn over the call over to Jim, I'd like to speak to our future capacity plans. 
Let me start by saying we acknowledge, truly acknowledge the importance of returning to positive unit revenue, and of course, we recognize that our future capacity plans directly impact of future process and performance. However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization and sustainability of earnings is maintained. At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best-performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive. However, if we determine that certain flags will not generate sustained profitability. We will then carefully consider modifying that capacity. 
Proof of our resolve is seen in us, again, reducing full year capacity, 0.25 points. We have now reduced our 2016 capacity growth plans by 0.75 points. This is a meaningful demonstration of our responsiveness to the present demand environment, particularly given that our initial guidance had always been responsibly and conservatively been constructed. 
Our review and analysis won't stop here as we continue to closely evaluate future changes. Going forward, as we adjust our capacity, we tend to update share owners on these modifications. 
So to wrap up, again, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter and their continued focus on our customers. I continue to spend a lot of time visiting stations, and I can't be more proud of the work they're all doing. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives.

As you can see on Slide 8, our second quarter unit revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations, primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives. 
With respect to the third quarter, we expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year with domestic and international PRASM to be in both same ranges. 
On Slide 8, we define each of the major headwinds we anticipate for the third quarter, summing to approximately 3.5 points of drag on PRASM. 
I'd now like to explain what we are seeing in the current demand environment. Leisure bookings have been strong as travelers are taking advantage of attractive fair levels and a strong U.S. dollar. Corporate travel bookings in the second quarter were essentially flat with revenue down approximately 3%, and corporate yields continue to be pressured. Looking towards the rest of the year, we expect to see further softening of corporate yields as summer leisure travel subsides. We will closely monitor these effects as they impact our close-in yield/high-yield revenue. 
On our April earnings call, we provided an outlook for fourth quarter PRASM, and I'd like to update you on that today. Due to downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP as well as a growing concern in the pace of corporate yield recovery, our fourth quarter estimates have been revised downward. In response, as you have seen from our announcement yesterday, we are reducing the second half capacity to better align with demand. 
On Slide 9, we show specific actions we are taking in each geographic entity. I'll let you read through the details on your own, but rest assured, we are actively managing our network to optimize results in a challenging revenue environment and are seeing the results. For instance, as a result of our capacity reallocation, Houston had the best year-over-year PRASM of any hub in June, followed closely by San Francisco and Denver. 
Taking all these regional dynamics into account with respect to capacity, as can be seen on Slide 10, we now anticipate full year capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5%. 
As Oscar mentioned, we are currently in the process of closely evaluating our capacity for the fourth quarter and 2017. 
As I wrap up, I want to reiterate our focus on maximizing profitability throughout our entire network. We are constantly evaluating the revenue and profitability landscape to ensure we have the proper plan in place. We continue to be committed to growing our capacity in line with demand, but remain willing and prepared to adjust when necessary. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerry."

A summary of our financial performance can be seen on Slide 12 for GAAP financials and Slide 13 for non-GAAP financials. 
Excluding special items, pretax earnings were $1.4 billion, with a pretax margin of 14.5%. Importantly, our earnings per share were $2.61, a 25% improvement year-over-year when adjusted for taxes as we continue to repurchase shares. 
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs for the quarter were 2.5% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third party expenses. 
For the third quarter, we expect nonfuel unit cost to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect unit cost to grow 2% to 3% despite reducing capacity by almost 1 point versus initial expectations. 
This guidance includes the benefit of our annual efficiency savings initiatives from our 2013 cost-savings program as well as our recently announced 2016 program. In total, we expect these 2 programs to drive $400 million of cost benefit when compared to 2015. This CASM guidance also includes the impact from the 3 ratified labor agreements reached this year but does not include any assumptions associated with the tentative agreement we recently reached with our flight attendants. Once ratified, we will provide more specifics on the impact to our costs. 
Based on the guidance we have provided for revenue and costs, we expect our pretax margin to be between 13.5% and 15.5% for the third quarter. 
With respect to cash, in the second quarter, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow. 
As you can see on Slide 15, during the quarter, we invested approximately $770 million in the business and took delivery of 2 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 2 737-800 aircraft. 
As Oscar mentioned, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our shares in the quarter.  As of the end of the second quarter, we still have approximately $255 million remaining on our prior $3 billion authorization. Additionally, as announced yesterday, our Board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. 
Returning cash to our shareholders is a core element of our capital allocation strategy. However, this will not be done at the expense of the health of our balance sheet as maintaining manageable debt levels is critical to running the airline through a variety of economic cycles. 
In conclusion, throughout the quarter, we have continued to demonstrate strong cost discipline, a commitment to invest in our business and a desire to reward our shareholders. We believe the plan we have in place positions us well to continue these actions going forward while allowing us to be nimble and responsive to a changing economic environment. 
I'll now turn it back over to Oscar."

We've had this discussion whether we choose to lease aircraft or buy aircraft. That can make a material difference in free cash flow, so when I'm looking at cash and cash allocation. I do take that into account, and we tend to finalize our plans for aircraft financing closer to the start of the year. But just kind of looking at where our aircraft CapEx next year is and kind of what we did this year, I think it's reasonable to assume, kind of a range of about 1/2 to 2/3 of our aircraft CapEx being financed year. So you could probably plug that into your -- and this could be a little bit less, it could be a little bit more depending on interest rates. But in the current interest rate environment, as you've seen us and others do, the capital markets are quite attractive. So that's one lever we have, sort of depending on the environment, how much of our aircraft CapEx is financed. Now in terms of other levers, we can always dial down non-aircraft CapEx. We had reasonable experience doing that. Aircraft CapEx, the only comment I would make is that it tends to be the case that when a manufacturer is building an aircraft, they expect you to take it. And they tend to start cutting that, call it 18 months, 15 months ahead of schedule. So you pretty much lock in most of the years of the aircraft, sort of, if not now, within the next few months. So -- but you can do a lot with aircraft beyond that, and we've done that in the past when necessary."

They are just working hard, and they're engaged. And I think that's a big critical factor. In addition, over time, between Project Quality a lot of the process and procedures, investments that we've made in the business, which are substantial are all assisting those folks, giving them the tools to properly do their job. And the benefits -- again, it's a good question, and we should come up with a more quantitative answer. It is a significant value, I say running -- running better is running cheaper.

Those are the things that will lead to PRASM. We're seeing our local share in our hubs rebounding back to levels that we saw before some of our integration issues, and so we're really, really excited about it. And lastly, on our call in June, we talked about $300 million of operational efficiency as well as some of the -- what I call choice. As we get back in terms of being a carrier of choice among our corporate partners, that's a line item in there that does relate to PRASM. So as Oscar said, a little bit to really put a specific number on it, but we're getting the right momentum."

I think as we look out and as I mentioned the fourth quarter, our expectations given -- expectations of demand as measured by GDP declining, we expect, obviously, that to continue. The corporate business, although we see the demand flat, the revenue is down on lower yields, we expect that to continue. That's correlated to the expectations of GDP coming down so that's -- a part of it was driving it. So that's domestic piece of our ability, putting pressure on our ability that I talked about on our April call. Internationally, we did see weakness in trans-Atlantic PRASM in the second quarter. We're adjusting to that. On our slide, we talked about the fourth quarter being down 1% to 2% of capacity. So we're reacting to that. Our capacity was up about 2% in the second quarter. We're guiding to 0.6% to 1.6% in the third, and we're guiding to down 1% to 2%. So we're addressing some of that demand on the trans-Atlantic side, aligning in that capacity with demand. Latin, we actually -- that's the one where we actually see the quarter-over-quarter improvement on a RASM basis stronger than some of the other entities, and so we feel good about where the Latin entity is heading as we head into the fourth quarter. On the Pacific side, it's really from a demand perspective, a lot of the things we talked about in the past was OA capacity. I will say, our launches of our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectations. We're particularly proud, I'm going to jump back to the trans-Atlantic on this. But our San Fran-Tel Aviv play is doing exceptionally well. But our Asia flights are all meeting and exceeding our expectations. So -- but the demand, there is still OA capacity demand. We are starting -- we have an opportunity to start San Fran-Shanghai #2 in October, so we're seeing a little bit of capacity from that. But we think that over the long run, that's the right investment for us to make."

We talked about surcharges over time and so forth being down and the -- and that correlation in terms of how fuels affected revenue. So some of that -- because I do agree in 2015, you're right. Industry revenue as a percent of GDP was down, and it was at an inflection point from previous years. And I expect that will continue again today. And so other than that correlation to fuel, back to the other thing we've talked about, right, we have seen capacity grow faster than demand. And that's putting pressure on yields, and corporate demand is not growing at the pace. The high corp yields, corporate demand is not growing at that pace of capacity. We're pretty consistent. I mean, you go back to our initial year guidance on capacity, and we're down from that initial year guidance on capacity. And that capacity, even though we're guiding today, will be less than what expectations of GDP today that we're talking to. So we're managing our plan in this environment, and we feel pretty good about it. The last thing I would say is that on the June call, we talked about our slimline and upgauged program. We have some modest growth in the third quarter. That capacity becomes really margin accretive. And so where leisure bookings are strong, that's a good capacity to absorb that leisure bookings. Lower RASM, but an extremely lower-cost CASM. So we really feel good about the plan we're rolling out."

And the other piece is that modest -- in that modest capacity growth we have, if you look at our domestic, we'll actually be slightly down in departures in the third quarter to drive that modest capacity growth. That said, margin-accretive initiatives that we talked about in June, giving a little bit more hold as we roll through the year, so that slimline growth and the upgauge strategy becoming less dependent on the regional and more dependent on the mainline. Again, it offers us ancillary product called first class and the Economy Plus. But it does come in a RASM that's lower than the average, but an even lower CASM, which makes it margin-accretive.

I think pricing actions always affect PRASM, but I think it's more of a continuation of the -- what the demand that we're seeing or demands relatively flat on lower yield.

One of the things we're watching as we move past that peak period of the summer season and strong leisure demand, and to your point, kind the corporate demand being relatively flat, that can put more -- that can put relatively more pressure on yields relative to the third quarter where you had peak demand strong from the June, July, August months. But to answer your question, we're kind of seeing demand where it was at. I would note that as energy sector continues to be down year-over-year, it's decelerating at a slower rate so that's also putting pressure on us on a year-over-year basis as we go forward."

This quarter marked another period in which United took meaningful steps forward in transforming the direction of this company. Notably, we saw our 25,000 flight attendants ratify new contract, our over 9,000 technicians reach a tentative agreement for a joint contract and we're excited to have that ratified soon. Additionally, in the quarter, as most of you know, I solidified my leadership team. This team has deep industry experience, incredible talent, in my opinion, and a very focused dedication to bring United into its next chapter, realizing the full potential of our great people and the great network [ph] and our assets. 
On the business side, we also continued to run a solid operation in the quarter. In fact, we achieved the best third quarter on-time performance in our history. I want to take this opportunity to thank dedicated and professional United employees that make all of this happened. Thanks to your commitment and determined efforts, we delivered a company best performance for arrivals during the busy July 4th holiday travel period and we also earned a first or second place ranking in key arrival and departure measures in the 3 months between Memorial Day and September 1 and culminated a great summer [ph] performance with delivering the best Labor Day weekend [ph] numbers on record. So it's great to have our operating program and people back in a good, consistent application of their work.
On the financial side, we continue to record strong financial results, including a pretax profit of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 15.7%, both excluding special items.
As many of you know, we will host an Investor Day on November 15. With that in mind, today we will focus on our discussion on our recent performance and near-term outlook and wait until November for a discussion of our plans for beyond 2017, including our outlook for both CASM and capacity.
So with that said, I'd like to turn the call over. This is the maiden voyage of Mr. Kirby, Ms. Haywood and Mr. Levy. But before I do that, just let me say to them all, we were incredibly thrilled to have each of you join the United family and very much looking forward to share our future with you. With that, Scott?"

Before turning to the slides, I just want to start by saying that I'm very excited to have joined the United team, and there are just fantastic opportunities ahead of us. This really is an exciting time for United. It's true that the last several years have been challenging with an integration that took longer and was more complex than anticipated, which created cultural, operating and commercial challenges. But now with the integration largely in the past, we can all turn our focus to realizing the full potential of United for employees, customers and investors. The foundation of a great airline is its people. And under Oscar's leadership, United has made tremendous progress in creating an integrated united United.
Achieving our full potential require lots of hard work. But with great people, the best network potential, the right plan and a focus and solid execution, we can deliver a great network operations and customer service, which, in turn, will lead to financial results that reflect the full potential of this airline. Julia will touch on some of the high-level opportunities in a moment. But before she does, I'd like to take the time to run through the quarter's performance.
On Slide 6, you can see that we've made meaningful strides in improving the operation over the past couple of years. On-time departures, arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage performance have all seen meaningful improvement. Going forward, we expect we'll continue to improve our operational results through better processes, more investments and equipment [ph] efficiencies. As we've talked about here in the past, at United, running a reliable airline is the key to winning with our customers. And we're gaining customers that we've lost during some of the operational challenges that we had with integration from 2012 through 2014.
Turning to revenue. Slide 7 shows consolidated [ph] revenue performance for the past quarter, which declined 5.8%. This was slightly better than initial expectations due in part to better close-in bookings and yields at end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast consolidated PRASM will decline between 4% and 6%. As you can see on the slide, we continue to see sequential second [ph] of unit revenue improvement as we're lapping many of the headwinds we've experienced over the past few quarters. For now at least, it appears that we are mostly -- most of the big onetime issues that have been affecting PRASM are in the past.  One of the stories of this slide is that issues like currency, energy, et cetera, aren't really having a meaningful impact year-over-year any longer.  We continue to see the sequential improvement in unit revenues despite the fact that there's a meaningful calendar shift of revenues out of fourth quarter and into the third and first quarters. Getting back to positive PRASM is now about a balanced supply-demand environment, advancements in product segmentation as well as many United-specific opportunities that we'll talk in more detail about at Investor Day in a few weeks.
Slide 8 has some additional detail on each of the geographic regions. Domestically, we're seeing positive close-in corporate booking trends and a better alignment of supply and demand. Additionally, the domestic pricing environment is beginning to feel more rational. We expect the Atlantic to remain the weakest region in the world. Overall capacity continues to grow at high rates. At the same time, demand is growing more slowly, putting pressure on unit revenues.
In the Pacific, we expect to see a continuation of recent trends with modest unit revenues declines, modest as [ph] compared to the Atlantic. And we expect Latin America to be the first region to return to positive year-over-year PRASM driven by good results across the region and particularly strong results in Brazil.
In summary, I think the revenue environment has bottomed, and we're starting to see signs of recovery in all regions with the possible exception of the Atlantic.
At this time, I'd like to now turn the call over to Julia to share with you our high-level thoughts on commercial opportunities we've identified at United, each of which we'll discuss in greater detail next month's Investor Day."

Ever since I began working with United, I can see the potential of our company, and I'm excited to be part of the team that unlock that potential. We see a number of opportunities throughout our commercial landscape to improve earnings over the next several years, with the largest opportunities being in revenue management, network optimization, product segmentation and product improvement. I will provide some high-level thoughts on each today, and we look forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide more details on these opportunities, including actions that we are taking and the associated financial impacts.
So first, with respect to revenue management. We believe there are a variety of both near-term and longer-term opportunity to improve here at United. Solutions to these opportunities can range from small but meaningful tweaks to our revenue management system to making more wholesale changes to our strategies for managing both pricing and inventory. And while much of this work has been delayed during United's integration, we are now moving quickly ahead
Second with respect to our network. Let me start by echoing Scott's earlier comment. United has the best network potential of any U.S. carrier, but we are not utilizing it fully today. We have spent the summer working to refine the mission of [ph] each of our hubs, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you at Investor Day. But as an important note, the full details of our network playbook won't be fully revealed in order to protect competitively sensitive information.
The third area of opportunity we will discuss is product segmentation. As you know, the work being done in this area signals a meaningful step change for our customers. And I believe that over time, it will have an even larger financial impact in the introduction of bag fees. We will use the time at our Investor Day to describe in more detail our entry-level fare product while also providing further plan to advance the segmentation progress [ph] in other areas here at United.
Finally, we will discuss the changes we are making with respect to our product and travel experience for our customers. In particular, we are now investing in the premium experience, rolling out United Polaris, our all new business-class service, transforming United Club and elevating our food and beverage offering.
In summary, we are looking forward to this day and sharing with you the hard work we have been doing to establish our commercial plans for the organization. Like Scott, I am thrilled to be part of this team and could not be more excited about the opportunities I see ahead for United.
So as I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers. In my past life, I spent more hours than I'd like to recount on planes and in airports. And I understand how important it is that we deliver to you the travel experience that you expect. The team here has made great strides over the past year, and I know that there are even more opportunities to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

I, too, am excited to be part of the United team. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm confident we'll be successful in making United the best airline in the world.
Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter earnings and fourth quarter investor update. While I will discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, please refer to both of these documents for additional details. With that said, let's review the company's third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.
Slide 12 shows the summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 13 has our non-GAAP results. The company generated pretax income, including special items, of $1.6 billion with a pretax margin of 15.7%. Net income was $1 billion, a decline from $1.7 billion in the third quarter of '15 due almost entirely to a higher book tax rate in 2015. Adjusting for book taxes, net income was down 9%, but earnings per share increased 7% due to the 15% reduction in share count as compared with 3Q '15.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs in the third quarter increased 3.4%, excluding special items, profit sharing and third-party business expenses. Approximately 2 percentage points of this increase was due to the impact of labor agreements ratified in 2015 for our pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and IAM-represented employees. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit sharing and third party business expenses, to increase between 4.75% and 5.75%. Approximately 4 percentage points of this increase is due to the impact of these new labor agreements. Our projections, however, do not include the effects of a recently ratified tentative agreement with our maintenance technicians since this has not yet been ratified.
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect full year 2016 nonfuel CASM to increase between 2.75% and 3.25%, with 2.3 percentage points of this increase due to the new labor agreements. However, in 2017, the year-over-year effect of these agreements is only expected to be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points.
As provided in yesterday's investor update, we currently expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 5% and 7%.
Turning to Slide 16 and capital allocation. Let me start by saying that we believe a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity is critical. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1.35 billion revolver, which remains untapped. Adjusted CapEx, including aircraft, nonaircraft and aircraft purchase deposits, was roughly $680 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of 18 new line [ph] aircraft, which contributes to CapEx of between $935 million and $955 million. We have already secured financing for these deliveries through last month's EETC transaction. For the full year, we expect approximately $3.2 billion of capital expenditures.
We also contributed $240 million for our pension plan this quarter, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $400 million. We do not plan any additional contributions this year.
With respect to the share repurchase, we returned $255 million to shareholders, purchasing 5.2 million shares during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash returned to shareholders to $2.4 billion year-to-date. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2014, we spent $4 billion to repurchase roughly 20% of shares outstanding. We currently have $2 billion remaining under our repurchase authority.
At our upcoming Investor Day, we will talk in detail about our plans for the capital structure of the business, including our views on liquidity, CapEx, debt, pension funding and shareholder returns. We will continue to be focused on finding ways to invest efficiently in our business. This quarter, we added our second used A319 to our fleet and plan to take a total of 11 of these aircraft by the end of 2017. In addition, we are reviewing our long-term CapEx needs including the fleet, and we will give you a more in-depth update next month. Returning excess cash to shareholders will continue to be an important part of the United capital allocation strategy, and we plan to provide you the context for our plans going forward.
In closing, this is a very good quarter for United, and I'm excited about many good quarters to come. I look speaking -- I look forward to speaking to each of you again in the next few weeks as we lay out our strategic plan for the company.
I'll turn it back over to Oscar now."

Particularly for us where in the fourth quarter, we're starting the second San Francisco to Shanghai, so we'll have, for United at least, a fair amount of capacity growth. So for that environment, I think we're [indiscernible] doing pretty well. There is a lot of capacity growth out of China in particular, but as you pointed out, the bilateral almost cap [indiscernible]. And so that's going to slow down dramatically in 2017 and beyond. The opposite is happening in Japan where capacity is starting to be reduced, and we see strong performance in Japan. So across the board, we feel pretty good about the trans-Pacific environment. Looking further out once the new airport opens, it takes a long time to change bilaterals and there's more than just changing route authority. The complication with flight to China is route authorities. Being able to get slots at commercially viable times has been really difficult. And so I expect that, that will be part of the next set of negotiations. And so that's difficult. I mean, it's difficult. I suspect it will take quite a bit of time to get results."

I mean, July is as United seeing stronger demand and bookings were coming in strong on the domestic entity, try to boost the demand and increase the amount of demand. And so we took set of markets didn't do anything. we took another set of markets and increased the local demand by 100% in the forecast. Another set of markets have increased both the local and the demand by 20%. Those are massive, massive changes in demand, and you would expect that to at least must match the changes in output. And at the end of the experiment, those 3, those 3 sets of entities, 3 groups were 0.2% different in outcomes. What that tells you is and what it really is, is we have a big complicated system. We don't even have a process to measure forecast versus actual [indiscernible] so big and complicated.

It's not going to happen overnight. it is going to require some changes to our system. fundamental architecture, the system we're built on, can handle it. There's no issues there. We're just going to have to -- do the work to build on top of that in management. It will take time and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we think it is a significant opportunity that's unique to United airlines."

Capacity is still growing faster than demand, but we are making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategy that are helping counteract some of that. And then as Julia mentioned and we'll talk more about at Investor Day, product segmentation is forward. I think it is a smooth structural change that we're going to go through here at United and will be good for our customers, to allow us to offer fairs peers to people that care about getting the lowest price.

This quarter marked another period in which United took meaningful steps forward in transforming the direction of this company. Notably, we saw our 25,000 flight attendants ratify new contract, our over 9,000 technicians reach a tentative agreement for a joint contract and we're excited to have that ratified soon. Additionally, in the quarter, as most of you know, I solidified my leadership team. This team has deep industry experience, incredible talent, in my opinion, and a very focused dedication to bring United into its next chapter, realizing the full potential of our great people and the great network and our assets.
On the business side, we also continued to run a solid operation in the quarter. In fact, we achieved the best third quarter on-time performance in our history. I want to take this opportunity to thank dedicated and professional United employees that make all of this happened. Thanks to your commitment and determined efforts, we delivered a company best performance for arrivals during the busy July 4th holiday travel period and we also earned a first or second place ranking in key arrival and departure measures in the 3 months between Memorial Day and September 1 and culminated a great summer performance with delivering the best Labor Day weekend performance [ph] numbers on record. So it's great to have our operating program and people back in a good, consistent application of their work.
On the financial side, we continue to record strong financial results, including a pretax profit of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 15.7%, both excluding special items.
As many of you know, we will host an Investor Day on November 15. With that in mind, today we will focus on our discussion on our recent performance and near-term outlook and wait until November for a discussion of our plans for beyond 2017, including our outlook for both CASM and capacity.
So with that said, I'd like to turn the call over. This is the maiden voyage of Mr. Kirby, Ms. Haywood and Mr. Levy. But before I do that, just let me say to them all, we were incredibly thrilled to have each of you join the United family and very much looking forward to share our future with you. With that, Scott?"

Before turning to the slides, I just want to start by saying that I'm very excited to have joined the United team, and there are just fantastic opportunities ahead of us. This really is an exciting time for United. It's true that the last several years have been challenging with an integration that took longer and was more complex than anticipated, which created cultural, operating and commercial challenges. But now with the integration largely in the past, we can all turn our focus to realizing the full potential of United for employees, customers and investors. The foundation of a great airline is its people. And under Oscar's leadership, United has made tremendous progress in creating an integrated united United.
Achieving our full potential require lots of hard work. But with great people, the best network potential, the right plan and a focus and solid execution, we can deliver a great network operations and customer service, which, in turn, will lead to financial results that reflect the full potential of this airline. Julia will touch on some of the high-level opportunities in a moment. But before she does, I'd like to take the time to run through the quarter's performance.
On Slide 6, you can see that we've made meaningful strides in improving the operation over the past couple of years. On-time departures, arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage performance have all seen meaningful improvement. Going forward, we expect we'll continue to improve our operational results through better processes, more investments and a commitment to efficiency. As we've talked about here in the past, at United, running a reliable airline is the key to winning with our customers. And we're gaining customers that we've lost during some of the operational challenges that we had with integration from 2012 through 2014.
Turning to revenue. Slide 7 shows consolidated unit revenue performance for the past quarter, which declined 5.8%. This was slightly better than initial expectations due in part to better close-in bookings and yields at end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast consolidated PRASM will decline between 4% and 6%. As you can see on the slide, we continue to see sequential second [indiscernible] of unit revenue improvement as we're lapping many of the headwinds we've experienced over the past few quarters. For now at least, it appears that we are mostly -- most of the big onetime issues that have been affecting PRASM are in the past.  One of the stories of this slide is that issues like currency, energy, et cetera, aren't really having a meaningful impact year-over-year any longer.  We continue to see the sequential improvement in unit revenues despite the fact that there's a meaningful calendar shift of revenues out of fourth quarter and into the third and first quarters. Getting back to positive PRASM is now about a balanced supply-demand environment, advancements in product segmentation as well as many United-specific opportunities that we'll talk in more detail about at Investor Day in a few weeks.
Slide 8 has some additional detail on each of the geographic regions. Domestically, we're seeing positive close-in corporate booking trends and a better alignment of supply and demand. Additionally, the domestic pricing environment is beginning to feel more rational. We expect the Atlantic to remain the weakest region in the world. Overall capacity continues to grow at high rates. At the same time, demand is growing more slowly, putting pressure on unit revenues.
In the Pacific, we expect to see a continuation of recent trends with modest unit revenue declines, modest at least as compared to the Atlantic. And we expect Latin America to be the first region to return to positive year-over-year PRASM driven by good results across the region and particularly strong results in Brazil.
In summary, I think the revenue environment has bottomed, and we're starting to see signs of recovery in all regions with the possible exception of the Atlantic.
At this time, I'd like to now turn the call over to Julia to share with you our high-level thoughts on commercial opportunities we've identified at United, each of which we'll discuss in greater detail next month's Investor Day."

Ever since I began working with United, I can see the potential of our company, and I'm excited to be part of the team that unlock that potential. We see a number of opportunities throughout our commercial landscape to improve earnings over the next several years, with the largest opportunities being in revenue management, network optimization, product segmentation and product improvement. I will provide some high-level thoughts on each today, and we look forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide more details on these opportunities, including actions that we are taking and the associated financial impacts.
So first, with respect to revenue management. We believe there are a variety of both near-term and longer-term opportunity to improve here at United. Solutions to these opportunities can range from small but meaningful tweaks to our revenue management system to making more wholesale changes to our strategies for managing both pricing and inventory. And while much of this work has been delayed during United's integration, we are now moving quickly ahead
Second with respect to our network. Let me start by echoing Scott's earlier comment. United has the best network potential of any U.S. carrier, but we are not utilizing it fully today. We have spent the summer working to refine the mission of each of our hubs, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you at Investor Day. But as an important note, the full details of our network playbook won't be fully revealed in order to protect competitively sensitive information.
The third area of opportunity we will discuss is product segmentation. As you know, the work being done in this area signals a meaningful step change for our customers. And I believe that over time, it will have an even larger financial impact in the introduction of bag fees. We will use the time at our Investor Day to describe in more detail our entry-level fare product while also providing further plan to advance the segmentation progress in other areas here at United.
Finally, we will discuss the changes we are making with respect to our product and travel experience for our customers. In particular, we are now investing in the premium experience, rolling out United Polaris, our all new business-class service, transforming United Club and elevating our food and beverage offering.
In summary, we are looking forward to this day and sharing with you the hard work we have been doing to establish our commercial plans for the organization. Like Scott, I am thrilled to be part of this team and could not be more excited about the opportunities I see ahead for United.
So as I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers. In my past life, I spent more hours than I'd like to recount on planes and in airports. And I understand how important it is that we deliver to you the travel experience that you expect. The team here has made great strides over the past year, and I know that there are even more opportunities to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

I, too, am excited to be part of the United team. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm confident we'll be successful in making United the best airline in the world.
Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter earnings and fourth quarter investor update. While I will discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, please refer to both of these documents for additional details. With that said, let's review the company's third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.
Slide 12 shows the summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 13 has our non-GAAP results. The company generated pretax income, including special items, of $1.6 billion with a pretax margin of 15.7%. Net income was $1 billion, a decline from $1.7 billion in the third quarter of '15 due almost entirely to a higher book tax rate in 2015. Adjusting for book taxes, net income was down 9%, but earnings per share increased 7% due to the 15% reduction in share count as compared with 3Q '15.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs in the third quarter increased 3.4%, excluding special items, profit sharing and third-party business expenses. Approximately 2 percentage points of this increase was due to the impact of labor agreements ratified in 2015 for our pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and IAM-represented employees. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit sharing and third party business expenses, to increase between 4.75% and 5.75%. Approximately 4 percentage points of this increase is due to the impact of these new labor agreements. Our projections, however, do not include the effects of a recently ratified tentative agreement with our maintenance technicians since this has not yet been ratified.
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect full year 2016 nonfuel CASM to increase between 2.75% and 3.25%, with 2.3 percentage points of this increase due to the new labor agreements. However, in 2017, the year-over-year effect of these agreements is only expected to be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points.
As provided in yesterday's investor update, we currently expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 5% and 7%.
Turning to Slide 16 and capital allocation. Let me start by saying that we believe a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity is critical. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1.35 billion revolver, which remains untapped. Adjusted CapEx, including aircraft, nonaircraft and aircraft purchase deposits, was roughly $680 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of 8 new mainline aircraft, which contributes to CapEx of between $935 million and $955 million. We have already secured financing for these deliveries through last month's EETC transaction. For the full year, we expect approximately $3.2 billion of capital expenditures.
We also contributed $240 million for our pension plan this quarter, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $400 million. We do not plan any additional contributions this year.
With respect to the share repurchase, we returned $255 million to shareholders, purchasing 5.2 million shares during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash returned to shareholders to $2.4 billion year-to-date. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2014, we spent $4 billion to repurchase roughly 20% of shares outstanding. We currently have $2 billion remaining under our repurchase authority.
At our upcoming Investor Day, we will talk in detail about our plans for the capital structure of the business, including our views on liquidity, CapEx, debt, pension funding and shareholder returns. We will continue to be focused on finding ways to invest efficiently in our business. This quarter, we added our second used A319 to our fleet and plan to take a total of 11 of these aircraft by the end of 2017. In addition, we are reviewing our long-term CapEx needs including the fleet, and we will give you a more in-depth update next month. Returning excess cash to shareholders will continue to be an important part of the United capital allocation strategy, and we plan to provide you the context for our plans going forward.
In closing, this is a very good quarter for United, and I'm excited about many good quarters to come. I look speaking -- I look forward to speaking to each of you again in the next few weeks as we lay out our strategic plan for the company.
I'll turn it back over to Oscar now."

And then with regard to China, you guys called out some, I guess, the outlook for the capacity situation to improve as we approach the caps under the bilateral. Can you just help us understand how you're thinking about the timing of the potential RASM improvement across the Pacific? It looks like the fourth quarter doesn't look great. But as you look out into early next year, how do you think the changes on bilateral sort of impact the capacity growth rate over time? And then, I guess, looking a  little further out with the new airport being constructed in Beijing, if there's a strong possibility that, that bilateral gets amended to include more capacity on both sides."

So we'll have, for United, at least, a fair amount of capacity growth. So for that environment, I think we're actually doing pretty well. There is a lot of capacity growth out of China in particular. But as you pointed out, the bilateral are almost capped, and so that's going to slow down dramatically in 2017 and beyond. The opposite is happening in Japan, where capacity is starting to be reduced, and we see strong performance in Japan. And  so across the board, we feel pretty good about the trans-Pacific environment. Looking further out, once the new airport opens, it takes a long time to change bilaterals and there's more than just changing route authority. The complication with flight to China is when we had the route authorities, being able to get slots at commercially viable times has been really difficult. And so I expect that, that will be part of the next set of negotiations. And so that's difficult. And given it's difficult, I suspect it will take quite a bit of time to get results."

I think that there's a lot of opportunity there. We're going to actually spend a fair a bit of time at Investor Day talking about this, but I'll give you a little bit of preview and just I like to give you one example from this summer. In July, as United was seeing stronger demand and bookings were coming in strong on the domestic entity, we try to boost the demand and increase the amount of demand. And so we took a set of markets that didn't do anything, we took another set of markets that increased the local demand by 100% in the forecast, another set of market that increased both the local and the flow demand by 20%. Those are massive, massive changes in demand, and you would expect that to lead to massive changes in output. And at the end of the experiment, those 3 -- those 3 set of entities, those 3 different experimental groups were 0.2% differ in outcomes. What that tells you is -- and what that really is, is we have a big, complicated system. We don't even have a process to measure forecast versus actual because it's so big and complicated. And the team does a fantastic job of managing on the back end, but we're hand managing a lot of markets on the back end. And as great as people are, you can't do that as well as a robust system with thousands and millions of data points. Even things like this year coming into next Christmas, the demand pattern is dramatically different with Christmas on a Sunday and sort of Christmas on a Friday. And we don't have any history that goes back to a time when Christmas was last on a Sunday. So we're trying to hand manage that. All of that -- the team is doing a great job of managing that in that environment, but it is a significant opportunity. It's going to require a lot of work. It's not going to happen overnight. It is going to require some changes to the system. Our fundamental architecture, the system we're built on, can handle it. There's no issues there. We just are going to have to build -- do the work to build on top of that end-to-end [ph] management, but it will take time. And we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but I think it is a significant opportunity that's unique to United Airlines."

And we are a service business, and our people make the airline run successfully every day. How they interact with our customers is the most important thing that we do. One of the things that I'm proud of as having been a part of in the industry is getting to the point where we can start giving back to our people. And we can do great things for our people in contacts after the 15 years that they've been through, in the post 9/11 era of furloughs, the concessions and losing [indiscernible]. And so it's rewarding to be able to actually give the kinds of raises and economic benefits back to people after all that they've endured. I do think the industry is different today. And I think it's important to not only do great things for our people, but for our customers and our shareholders. All of those things happen to go together. I think 1999 is probably not the best example of time to use because we all know what happened in 2001, and that really triggered all the negative things that happened for airline employees over the next 15 years. We're past that, and we're moving forward. I think we can do the kinds of things that we've done with these contracts for our people, which is fantastic, and still get to a world where we have margins that are higher than they are today and do great things for our shareholders as well.

If you were to rank order the catalysts that are driving domestic RASM improvement, how would that look? Is it tighter aggregate supply, followed by better fare fencing, followed by increases to base fares? Or is it cessation of advantage fares, revisions to AP [ph] requirements, that sort of thing?

And it used to be that we could use fare fences, Saturday night stay to segment the product between business travelers and leisure travelers, and we can't anymore. And the growth of low-cost carriers has forever changed that part of the business. We have gotten -- we are getting better even in that world at figuring out segmentation, and we're doing more on segmentation here certainly at United. But I think across the industry, we're getting better at that. Capacity is still growing faster than demand, but we're making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategy that are helping counteract some of that. And then as Julia mentioned and we'll talk more about on Investor Day, product segmentation is a huge leap forward. I think it is a new structural change that we're going to go through here at United. It will be good for our customers. It will allow us to offer low fares to people that care only about getting the lowest price, and it will allow us to offer a better product to customers who care about other aspects of the product. And so we're excited about that. But really, this has been, with industry, a journey of how do we change this and how we segment our product for our various customers. And we're just, I think, mostly getting better at that. Right now, it's the pricing and yield management stuff that we're doing this better, and product segmentation is going to kick off in earnest next year."

This quarter marked another period in which United took meaningful steps forward in transforming the direction of this company. Notably, we saw our 25,000 flight attendants ratify a new contract, our over 9,000 technicians reached a tentative agreement for a joint contract and we're excited to have that ratified soon. Additionally, in the quarter, as most of you know, I solidified my leadership team. This team has deep industry experience, incredible talent, in my opinion, and a very focused dedication to bring United into its next chapter, realizing the full potential of our great people and the great network and our assets.
On the business side, we also continued to run a solid operation in the quarter. In fact, we achieved the best third quarter on-time performance in our history. I want to take this opportunity to thank the dedicated and professional United employees that make all of this happen. Thanks to your commitment and determined efforts, we delivered a company-best performance for arrivals during the busy July 4th holiday travel period and we also earned a first or second place ranking in key arrival and departure measures in the 3 months between Memorial Day and September 1, and culminated our great summer performance with delivering the best Labor Day weekend performance [ph] numbers on record. So it's great to have our operating program and people back in a good, consistent application of their work.
On the financial side, we continue to record strong financial results, including a pretax profit of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 15.7%, both excluding special items.
As many of you know, we will host an Investor Day on November 15. With that in mind, today, we will focus our discussion on our recent performance and near-term outlook and wait until November for a discussion of our plans for beyond 2017, including our outlook for both CASM and capacity.
So with that said, I'd like to turn the call over. This is the maiden voyage of both Mr. Kirby, Ms. Haywood and Mr. Levy. But before I do that, just let me say to them all that we are incredibly thrilled to have each of you join the United family and very much looking forward to sharing our future with you.

Before turning to the slides, I just want to start by saying that I'm very excited to have joined the United team, and there are just fantastic opportunities ahead of us. This really is an exciting time for United. It's true that the last several years have been challenging, with an integration that took longer and was more complex than anticipated, which created cultural, operating and commercial challenges. But now with the integration largely in the past, we can all turn our focus to realizing the full potential of United for our employees, customers and investors. The foundation of a great airline is its people. And under Oscar's leadership, United has made tremendous progress with creating an integrated, united United.
Achieving our full potential will require lots of hard work. But with great people, the best network potential, the right plan and a focus on solid execution, we can deliver a great network, operations and customer service, which, in turn, will lead to financial results that reflect the full potential of this airline. Julia will touch on some of the high-level opportunities in a moment. But before she does, I'd like to take some time to run through the quarter's performance.
On Slide 6, you can see that we've made meaningful strides in improving the operation over the past couple of years. On-time departures, arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage performance have all seen meaningful improvement. Going forward, we expect we'll continue to improve our operational results through better processes, smart investments and a commitment to efficiency. As we've talked about here in the past at United, running a reliable airline is the key to winning with our customers. And we're gaining customers that we've lost during some of the operational challenges that we had with integration from 2012 through 2014.
Turning to revenue. Slide 7 shows consolidated unit revenue performance for the past quarter, which declined 5.8%. This was slightly better than initial expectations, due in part to better close-in bookings and yields at the end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast consolidated PRASM will decline between 4% and 6%. As you can see on the slide, we continue to see sequential second revenue -- unit revenue improvement as we're lapping many of the headwinds we've experienced over the past few quarters. For now at least, it appears that we are mostly -- that most of the big onetime issues that have been affecting PRASM are in the past. One of the stories of this slide is that issues like currency, energy, et cetera, aren't really having a meaningful impact year-over-year any longer. We continue to see the sequential improvement in unit revenues despite the fact that there's a meaningful calendar shift of revenues out of fourth quarter and into the third and first quarters. Getting back to positive PRASM is now about a balanced supply-demand environment, advancements in product segmentation as well as many United-specific opportunities that we'll talk in more detail about at Investor Day in a few weeks.
Slide 8 has some additional detail on each of the geographic regions. Domestically, we're seeing positive close-in corporate booking trends and a better alignment of supply and demand. Additionally, the domestic pricing environment is beginning to feel more rational. We expect the Atlantic to remain the weakest region in the world. Overall capacity continues to grow at high rates. At the same time, demand is growing more slowly, putting pressure on unit revenues.
In the Pacific, we expect to see a continuation of recent trends with modest unit revenue declines, modest at least as compared to the Atlantic. And we expect Latin America to be the first region to return to positive year-over-year PRASM, driven by good results across the region, but particularly strong results in Brazil.
In summary, I think the revenue environment has bottomed, and we're starting to see signs of recovery in all regions with the possible exception of the Atlantic.
At this time, I'd like to now turn the call over to Julia to share with you our high-level thoughts on commercial opportunities we've identified at United, each of which we'll discuss in greater detail at next month's Investor Day."

Ever since I began working with United, I can see the potential of our company, and I'm excited to be part of the team that unlocks that potential. We see a number of opportunities throughout our commercial landscape to improve earnings over the next several years, with the largest opportunities being in revenue management, network optimization, product segmentation and product improvement. I will provide some high-level thoughts on each today, and we look forward to our upcoming Investor Day, where we will provide more details on these opportunities, including actions that we are taking and the associated financial impacts.
So first, with respect to revenue management. We believe there are a variety of both near-term and longer-term opportunity to improve here at United. Solutions to these opportunities can range from small but meaningful tweaks to our revenue management system to making more wholesale changes to our strategies for managing both pricing and inventory. And while much of this work has been delayed during United's integration, we are now moving quickly ahead.
Second, with respect to our network. Let me start by echoing Scott's earlier comment. United has the best network potential of any U.S. carrier, but we are not utilizing it fully today. We have spent the summer working to refine the mission of each of our hubs, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you at Investor Day. But as an important note, the full details of our network playbook won't be fully revealed in order to protect competitively sensitive information.
The third area of opportunity we will discuss is product segmentation. As you know, the work being done in this area signals a meaningful step change for our customers. And I believe that over time, it will have an even larger financial impact than the introduction of bag fees. We will use the time at our Investor Day to describe in more detail our entry-level fare product while also providing further plans to advance the segmentation progress in other areas here at United.
Finally, we will discuss the changes we are making with respect to our product and travel experience for our customers. In particular, we are now investing in the premium experience, rolling out United Polaris, our all-new business-class service, transforming United Club and elevating our food and beverage offering.
In summary, we are looking forward to this day and sharing with you the hard work we have been doing to establish a commercial plan for the organization. Like Scott, I am thrilled to be part of this team and could not be more excited about the opportunities I see ahead for United.
So as I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers. In my past life, I spent more hours than I'd like to recount on planes and in airports. And I understand how important it is that we deliver to you the travel experience that you expect. The team here has made great strides over the past year, and I know that there are even more opportunities to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

I, too, am excited to be part of the United team. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm confident we'll be successful in making United the best airline in the world.
Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter earnings and fourth quarter investor update. While I will discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, please refer to both of these documents for additional details. With that said, let's review the company's third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.
Slide 12 shows the summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 13 has our non-GAAP results. The company generated pretax income, excluding special items, of $1.6 billion, with a pretax margin of 15.7%. Net income was $1 billion, a decline from $1.7 billion in the third quarter of '15, due almost entirely to a higher book tax rate in 2015. Adjusting for book taxes, net income was down 9%, but earnings per share increased 7% due to the 15% reduction in share count as compared with 3Q '15.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs in the third quarter increased 3.4%, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party business expenses. Approximately 2 percentage points of this increase was due to the impact of labor agreements ratified in 2016 with our pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and IAM-represented employees. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party business expenses, to increase between 4.75% and 5.75%. Approximately 4 percentage points of this increase is due to the impact of these new labor agreements. Our projections, however, do not include the effects of a recently-ratified tentative agreement with our maintenance technicians since it has not yet been ratified.
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect full year 2016 nonfuel CASM to increase between 2.75% and 3.25%, with 2.3 percentage points of this increase due to the new labor agreements. However, in 2017, the year-over-year effect of these agreements is only expected to be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points.
As provided in yesterday's investor update, we currently expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 5% and 7%.
Turning to Slide 16 and capital allocation. Let me start by saying that we believe a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity is critical. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1.35 billion revolver, which remains untapped. Adjusted CapEx, including aircraft, nonaircraft and aircraft purchase deposits, was roughly $680 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of 8 new mainline aircraft, which contributes to CapEx of between $935 million and $955 million. We have already secured financing for these deliveries through last month's EETC transaction. For the full year, we expect approximately $3.2 billion of capital expenditures.
We also contributed $240 million to our pension plans this quarter, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $400 million. We do not plan any additional contributions this year.
With respect to the share repurchase, we returned $255 million to shareholders, purchasing 5.2 million shares during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash returned to shareholders to $2.4 billion year-to-date. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2014, we spent $4 billion to repurchase roughly 20% of shares outstanding. We currently have $2 billion remaining under our repurchase authority.
At our upcoming Investor Day, we will talk in detail about our plans for the capital structure of the business, including our views on liquidity, CapEx, debt, pension funding and shareholder returns. We will continue to be focused on finding ways to invest efficiently in our business. This quarter, we added our second used A319 to our fleet and plan to take a total of 11 of these aircraft by the end of 2017. In addition, we are reviewing our long-term CapEx needs, including the fleet, and we will give you a more in-depth update next month. Returning excess cash to shareholders will continue to be an important part of the United capital allocation strategy, and we plan to provide you the context for our plans going forward.
In closing, this was a very good quarter for United, and I'm excited about many good quarters to come. I look speaking -- I look forward to speaking to each of you again in the next few weeks as we lay out our strategic plan for the company.
I'll turn it back over to Oscar now."

I think we started, actually -- actually, if you look to where we were in the third quarter compared to our competitor, we start from a better position. So I suspect we will get to positive domestic RASM before they do. I think we also have more opportunity and more levers that are probably United specific. But we are certainly trending in that direction. And whether it's going to get there in November to January or shortly thereafter, it's hard to say for certain at this point. But we're trending in that direction, and we feel pretty good about the domestic environment. It certainly feels better than it has in a couple of years. Now, I acknowledge that's an easy comparison because it hasn't felt very good the past couple of years, but it feels better than it has in quite some time."

And then with regard to China, you guys called out some, I guess, the outlook for the capacity situation to improve as we approach the caps under the bilateral. Can you just help us understand how you're thinking about the timing of the potential RASM improvement across the Pacific? It looks like the fourth quarter doesn't look great. But as you look out into early next year, how do you think the changes on bilateral sort of impact the capacity growth rate over time? And then, I guess, looking a  little further out with the new airport being constructed in Beijing, if there's a strong possibility that, that bilateral gets amended to include more capacity on both sides."

So we'll have, for United, at least, a fair amount of capacity growth. So for that environment, I think we're actually doing pretty well. There is a lot of capacity growth out of China in particular. But as you pointed out, the bilaterals are almost capped, and so that's going to slow down dramatically in 2017 and beyond. The opposite is happening in Japan, where capacity is starting to be reduced, and we see strong performance in Japan. And so across the board, we feel pretty good about the trans-Pacific environment. Looking further out, once the new airport opens, it takes a long time to change bilaterals and there's more than just changing route authority. The complication with flying to China is even when we had the route authorities, being able to get slots at commercially viable times has been really difficult. And so I expect that will be part of the next set of negotiations. And so that's difficult. And given it's difficult, I suspect it will take quite a bit of time to get results."

I think that there's a lot of opportunity there. We're going to actually spend a fair bit of time at Investor Day talking about this, but I'll give you a little bit of preview and just I'd like to give you one example from this summer. In July, as United was seeing stronger demand and bookings were coming in strong in the domestic entity, we tried to boost the demand and increase the amount of demand. And so we took a set of markets and didn't do anything, we took another set of markets and increased the local demand by 100% in the forecast, another set of markets and increased both the local and the flow demand by 20%. Those are massive, massive changes in demand, and you would expect that to lead to massive changes in output. And at the end of the experiment, those 3 -- those 3 sets of entities, those 3 different experimental groups were 0.2% different in outcomes. What that tells you is -- and what that really is, is we have a big, complicated system. We don't even have a process to measure forecast versus actual because it's so big and complicated. And the team does a fantastic job of managing on the back end, but we're hand managing a lot of markets on the back end. And as great as people are, you can't do that as well as a robust system with thousands and millions of data points. Even things like this year coming into next Christmas, the demand patterns are dramatically different with Christmas on a Sunday instead of Christmas on a Friday. And we don't have any history that goes back to a time when Christmas was last on a Sunday. So we're trying to hand manage that. All of that -- the team is doing a great job of managing that in that environment, but it is a significant opportunity. It's going to require a lot of work. It's not going to happen overnight. It is going to require some changes in the system. Our fundamental architecture, the system that we're built on, can handle it. There's no issues there. We just are going to have to build -- do the work to build on top of that in yield management, but it will take time. And we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but I think it is a significant opportunity that's unique to United Airlines."

Let me start and then I think I'll let Scott finish, given that he's had a lot deeper, broader, long-term experience here. I understand the history of this. It's been told to me repeatedly as we finished our labor contracts. And I completely reject the notion that you can't have efficiency and productivity while also having customer service, and I've said constantly. And to that end, in order to get that customer service and that productivity, we have to invest in these folks. And so our employees are very core to our product and customer experience. These costs -- the labor costs, are market based and costly, to your point. Where the difference we are counting on is that, over time, this collaborative relationship we are building with our labor workforce, we can drive productivity. In fact, we're in this together. And some will call that naïve. Some will call that, that history doesn't prove that. But I think we're already seeing little green shoots, as we say, around that. But that's been my focus. Now I have experts that are going to help us do that. So Scott, would you add something to that?"

And we are a service business, and our people make the airline run successfully every day and how they interact with our customers is the most important thing that we do. One of the things that I'm proud of as having been a part of in the industry is getting to the point where we can start giving back to our people. And we can do great things for our people in contracts. After the 15 years that they've been through, in the post 9/11 era of furloughs and concessions and losing pensions, and so it's rewarding to be able to actually give the kinds of raises and economic benefits back to people after all that they've endured. I do think the industry is different today. And I think it's important to not only do great things for our people, but for our customers and our shareholders. All of those things happen to go together. I think 1999 is probably not the best example of time to use because we all know what happened in 2001, and that really triggered all the negative things that happened for airline employees over the next 15 years. We're past that, and we're moving forward. I think we can do the kinds of things that we've done with these contracts for our people, which is fantastic, and still get to a world where we have margins that are higher than they are today and do great things for our shareholders as well. And we'll talk some more about some of those targets at Investor Day, but we're looking forward to that. But we're all genuinely happy for our people, that we can offer them these kinds of pay raises and contracts."

And it used to be that we could use fare fences, Saturday night stay, to segment the product between business travelers and leisure travelers, and we can't anymore. And the growth of low-cost carriers has forever changed that part of the business. We have gotten -- we are getting better at, even in that world, at figuring out segmentation, and we're doing more on segmentation here, certainly at United, but I think across the industry, we're getting better at that. Capacity is still growing faster than demand, but we're making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategy that are helping counteract some of that. And then as Julia mentioned and we'll talk more about on Investor Day, product segmentation is a huge leap forward. I think it is a new structural change that we're going to go through here at United. It will be good for our customers. It will allow us to offer low fares to people that care only about getting the lowest price, and it will allow us to offer a better product to customers who care about other aspects of the product. And so we're excited about that. But really, this has been, with an industry, a journey of how do we -- changes in how we segment our product for our various customers. And we're just, I think, mostly getting better at that. Right now, it's pricing and yield management stuff that we're doing that's better, and product segmentation is going to kick off in earnest next year."

And we'll make changes wherever we think it's appropriate. I think one example would be mix of new and used aircraft. We've already started bringing in some used A319s that were acquired at attractive rates. We're going to continue to keep an eye out for high-quality used aircraft to blend into the mix of the fleet here.

So today, we fly a lot of hub to hub between Dallas and Chicago or between Denver and Dallas, we fly regional jets, and that's something that is unique about United that will likely change. In hub-to-hub markets, we'll likely fly bigger airplanes and we'll use our regionals to go fly into places that are smaller cities but that generate higher-yielding connecting revenues for the network.

This quarter marked another period in which United took meaningful steps forward in transforming the direction of this company. Notably, we saw our 25,000 flight attendants ratify a new contract, our over 9,000 technicians reached a tentative agreement for a joint contract and we're excited to have that ratified soon. Additionally, in the quarter, as most of you know, I solidified my leadership team. This team has deep industry experience, incredible talent, in my opinion, and a very focused dedication to bring United into its next chapter, realizing the full potential of our great people and the great network and our assets.
On the business side, we also continued to run a solid operation in the quarter. In fact, we achieved the best third quarter on-time performance in our history. I want to take this opportunity to thank the dedicated and professional United employees that make all of this happen. Thanks to your commitment and determined efforts, we delivered a company-best performance for arrivals during the busy July 4th holiday travel period and we also earned a first or second place ranking in key arrival and departure measures in the 3 months between Memorial Day and September 1, and culminated our great summer performance with delivering the best Labor Day weekend performance [ph] numbers on record. So it's great to have our operating program and people back in a good, consistent application of their work.
On the financial side, we continue to record strong financial results, including a pretax profit of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 15.7%, both excluding special items.
As many of you know, we will host an Investor Day on November 15. With that in mind, today, we will focus our discussion on our recent performance and near-term outlook and wait until November for a discussion of our plans for beyond 2017, including our outlook for both CASM and capacity.
So with that said, I'd like to turn the call over. This is the maiden voyage of both Mr. Kirby, Ms. Haywood and Mr. Levy. But before I do that, just let me say to them all that we are incredibly thrilled to have each of you join the United family and very much looking forward to sharing our future with you.

Before turning to the slides, I just want to start by saying that I'm very excited to have joined the United team, and there are just fantastic opportunities ahead of us. This really is an exciting time for United. It's true that the last several years have been challenging, with an integration that took longer and was more complex than anticipated, which created cultural, operating and commercial challenges. But now with the integration largely in the past, we can all turn our focus to realizing the full potential of United for our employees, customers and investors. The foundation of a great airline is its people. And under Oscar's leadership, United has made tremendous progress with creating an integrated, united United.
Achieving our full potential will require lots of hard work. But with great people, the best network potential, the right plan and a focus on solid execution, we can deliver a great network, operations and customer service, which, in turn, will lead to financial results that reflect the full potential of this airline. Julia will touch on some of the high-level opportunities in a moment. But before she does, I'd like to take some time to run through the quarter's performance.
On Slide 6, you can see that we've made meaningful strides in improving the operation over the past couple of years. On-time departures, arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage performance have all seen meaningful improvement. Going forward, we expect we'll continue to improve our operational results through better processes, smart investments and a commitment to efficiency. As we've talked about here in the past at United, running a reliable airline is the key to winning with our customers. And we're gaining customers that we've lost during some of the operational challenges that we had with integration from 2012 through 2014.
Turning to revenue. Slide 7 shows consolidated unit revenue performance for the past quarter, which declined 5.8%. This was slightly better than initial expectations, due in part to better close-in bookings and yields at the end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast consolidated PRASM will decline between 4% and 6%. As you can see on the slide, we continue to see sequential second revenue -- unit revenue improvement as we're lapping many of the headwinds we've experienced over the past few quarters. For now at least, it appears that we are mostly -- that most of the big onetime issues that have been affecting PRASM are in the past. One of the stories of this slide is that issues like currency, energy, et cetera, aren't really having a meaningful impact year-over-year any longer. We continue to see the sequential improvement in unit revenues despite the fact that there's a meaningful calendar shift of revenues out of fourth quarter and into the third and first quarters. Getting back to positive PRASM is now about a balanced supply-demand environment, advancements in product segmentation as well as many United-specific opportunities that we'll talk in more detail about at Investor Day in a few weeks.
Slide 8 has some additional detail on each of the geographic regions. Domestically, we're seeing positive close-in corporate booking trends and a better alignment of supply and demand. Additionally, the domestic pricing environment is beginning to feel more rational. We expect the Atlantic to remain the weakest region in the world. Overall capacity continues to grow at high rates. At the same time, demand is growing more slowly, putting pressure on unit revenues.
In the Pacific, we expect to see a continuation of recent trends with modest unit revenue declines, modest at least as compared to the Atlantic. And we expect Latin America to be the first region to return to positive year-over-year PRASM, driven by good results across the region, but particularly strong results in Brazil.
In summary, I think the revenue environment has bottomed, and we're starting to see signs of recovery in all regions with the possible exception of the Atlantic.
At this time, I'd like to now turn the call over to Julia to share with you our high-level thoughts on commercial opportunities we've identified at United, each of which we'll discuss in greater detail at next month's Investor Day."

Ever since I began working with United, I can see the potential of our company, and I'm excited to be part of the team that unlocks that potential. We see a number of opportunities throughout our commercial landscape to improve earnings over the next several years, with the largest opportunities being in revenue management, network optimization, product segmentation and product improvement. I will provide some high-level thoughts on each today, and we look forward to our upcoming Investor Day, where we will provide more details on these opportunities, including actions that we are taking and the associated financial impacts.
So first, with respect to revenue management. We believe there are a variety of both near-term and longer-term opportunity to improve here at United. Solutions to these opportunities can range from small but meaningful tweaks to our revenue management system to making more wholesale changes to our strategies for managing both pricing and inventory. And while much of this work has been delayed during United's integration, we are now moving quickly ahead.
Second, with respect to our network. Let me start by echoing Scott's earlier comment. United has the best network potential of any U.S. carrier, but we are not utilizing it fully today. We have spent the summer working to refine the mission of each of our hubs, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you at Investor Day. But as an important note, the full details of our network playbook won't be fully revealed in order to protect competitively sensitive information.
The third area of opportunity we will discuss is product segmentation. As you know, the work being done in this area signals a meaningful step change for our customers. And I believe that over time, it will have an even larger financial impact than the introduction of bag fees. We will use the time at our Investor Day to describe in more detail our entry-level fare product while also providing further plans to advance the segmentation progress in other areas here at United.
Finally, we will discuss the changes we are making with respect to our product and travel experience for our customers. In particular, we are now investing in the premium experience, rolling out United Polaris, our all-new business-class service, transforming United Club and elevating our food and beverage offering.
In summary, we are looking forward to this day and sharing with you the hard work we have been doing to establish a commercial plan for the organization. Like Scott, I am thrilled to be part of this team and could not be more excited about the opportunities I see ahead for United.
So as I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers. In my past life, I spent more hours than I'd like to recount on planes and in airports. And I understand how important it is that we deliver to you the travel experience that you expect. The team here has made great strides over the past year, and I know that there are even more opportunities to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

I, too, am excited to be part of the United team. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm confident we'll be successful in making United the best airline in the world.
Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter earnings and fourth quarter investor update. While I will discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, please refer to both of these documents for additional details. With that said, let's review the company's third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.
Slide 12 shows the summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 13 has our non-GAAP results. The company generated pretax income, excluding special items, of $1.6 billion, with a pretax margin of 15.7%. Net income was $1 billion, a decline from $1.7 billion in the third quarter of '15, due almost entirely to a higher book tax rate in 2015. Adjusting for book taxes, net income was down 9%, but earnings per share increased 7% due to the 15% reduction in share count as compared with 3Q '15.
Moving to Slide 14. Nonfuel unit costs in the third quarter increased 3.4%, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party business expenses. Approximately 2 percentage points of this increase was due to the impact of labor agreements ratified in 2016 with our pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and IAM-represented employees. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party business expenses, to increase between 4.75% and 5.75%. Approximately 4 percentage points of this increase is due to the impact of these new labor agreements. Our projections, however, do not include the effects of a recently-ratified tentative agreement with our maintenance technicians since it has not yet been ratified.
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect full year 2016 nonfuel CASM to increase between 2.75% and 3.25%, with 2.3 percentage points of this increase due to the new labor agreements. However, in 2017, the year-over-year effect of these agreements is only expected to be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points.
As provided in yesterday's investor update, we currently expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 5% and 7%.
Turning to Slide 16 and capital allocation. Let me start by saying that we believe a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity is critical. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1.35 billion revolver, which remains untapped. Adjusted CapEx, including aircraft, nonaircraft and aircraft purchase deposits, was roughly $680 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of 8 new mainline aircraft, which contributes to CapEx of between $935 million and $955 million. We have already secured financing for these deliveries through last month's EETC transaction. For the full year, we expect approximately $3.2 billion of capital expenditures.
We also contributed $240 million to our pension plans this quarter, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $400 million. We do not plan any additional contributions this year.
With respect to the share repurchase, we returned $255 million to shareholders, purchasing 5.2 million shares during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash returned to shareholders to $2.4 billion year-to-date. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2014, we spent $4 billion to repurchase roughly 20% of shares outstanding. We currently have $2 billion remaining under our repurchase authority.
At our upcoming Investor Day, we will talk in detail about our plans for the capital structure of the business, including our views on liquidity, CapEx, debt, pension funding and shareholder returns. We will continue to be focused on finding ways to invest efficiently in our business. This quarter, we added our second used A319 to our fleet and plan to take a total of 11 of these aircraft by the end of 2017. In addition, we are reviewing our long-term CapEx needs, including the fleet, and we will give you a more in-depth update next month. Returning excess cash to shareholders will continue to be an important part of the United capital allocation strategy, and we plan to provide you the context for our plans going forward.
In closing, this was a very good quarter for United, and I'm excited about many good quarters to come. I look speaking -- I look forward to speaking to each of you again in the next few weeks as we lay out our strategic plan for the company.
I'll turn it back over to Oscar now."

So we'll have, for United, at least, a fair amount of capacity growth. So for that environment, I think we're actually doing pretty well. There is a lot of capacity growth out of China in particular. But as you pointed out, the bilaterals are almost capped, and so that's going to slow down dramatically in 2017 and beyond. The opposite is happening in Japan, where capacity is starting to be reduced, and we see strong performance in Japan. And so across the board, we feel pretty good about the trans-Pacific environment. Looking further out, once the new airport opens, it takes a long time to change bilaterals and there's more than just changing route authority. The complication with flying to China is even when we had the route authorities, being able to get slots at commercially viable times has been really difficult. And so I expect that will be part of the next set of negotiations. And so that's difficult. And given it's difficult, I suspect it will take quite a bit of time to get results."

I think that there's a lot of opportunity there. We're going to actually spend a fair bit of time at Investor Day talking about this, but I'll give you a little bit of preview and just I'd like to give you one example from this summer. In July, as United was seeing stronger demand and bookings were coming in strong in the domestic entity, we tried to boost the demand and increase the amount of demand. And so we took a set of markets and didn't do anything, we took another set of markets and increased the local demand by 100% in the forecast, another set of markets and increased both the local and the flow demand by 20%. Those are massive, massive changes in demand, and you would expect that to lead to massive changes in output. And at the end of the experiment, those 3 -- those 3 sets of entities, those 3 different experimental groups were 0.2% different in outcomes. What that tells you is -- and what that really is, is we have a big, complicated system. We don't even have a process to measure forecast versus actual because it's so big and complicated. And the team does a fantastic job of managing on the back end, but we're hand managing a lot of markets on the back end. And as great as people are, you can't do that as well as a robust system with thousands and millions of data points. Even things like this year coming into next Christmas, the demand patterns are dramatically different with Christmas on a Sunday instead of Christmas on a Friday. And we don't have any history that goes back to a time when Christmas was last on a Sunday. So we're trying to hand manage that. All of that -- the team is doing a great job of managing that in that environment, but it is a significant opportunity. It's going to require a lot of work. It's not going to happen overnight. It is going to require some changes in the system. Our fundamental architecture, the system that we're built on, can handle it. There's no issues there. We just are going to have to build -- do the work to build on top of that in yield management, but it will take time. And we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but I think it is a significant opportunity that's unique to United Airlines."

And to that end, in order to get that customer service and that productivity, we have to invest in these folks. And so our employees are very core to our product and customer experience. These costs -- the labor costs, are market based and costly, to your point. Where the difference we are counting on is that, over time, this collaborative relationship we are building with our labor workforce, we can drive productivity. In fact, we're in this together.

And we are a service business, and our people make the airline run successfully every day and how they interact with our customers is the most important thing that we do. One of the things that I'm proud of as having been a part of in the industry is getting to the point where we can start giving back to our people. And we can do great things for our people in contracts. After the 15 years that they've been through, in the post 9/11 era of furloughs and concessions and losing pensions, and so it's rewarding to be able to actually give the kinds of raises and economic benefits back to people after all that they've endured. I do think the industry is different today. And I think it's important to not only do great things for our people, but for our customers and our shareholders. All of those things happen to go together. I think 1999 is probably not the best example of time to use because we all know what happened in 2001, and that really triggered all the negative things that happened for airline employees over the next 15 years. We're past that, and we're moving forward. I think we can do the kinds of things that we've done with these contracts for our people, which is fantastic, and still get to a world where we have margins that are higher than they are today and do great things for our shareholders as well. And we'll talk some more about some of those targets at Investor Day, but we're looking forward to that.

And it used to be that we could use fare fences, Saturday night stay, to segment the product between business travelers and leisure travelers, and we can't anymore. And the growth of low-cost carriers has forever changed that part of the business. We have gotten -- we are getting better at, even in that world, at figuring out segmentation, and we're doing more on segmentation here, certainly at United, but I think across the industry, we're getting better at that. Capacity is still growing faster than demand, but we're making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategy that are helping counteract some of that. And then as Julia mentioned and we'll talk more about on Investor Day, product segmentation is a huge leap forward. I think it is a new structural change that we're going to go through here at United. It will be good for our customers. It will allow us to offer low fares to people that care only about getting the lowest price, and it will allow us to offer a better product to customers who care about other aspects of the product. And so we're excited about that. But really, this has been, with an industry, a journey of how do we -- changes in how we segment our product for our various customers. And we're just, I think, mostly getting better at that. Right now, it's pricing and yield management stuff that we're doing that's better, and product segmentation is going to kick off in earnest next year."

We've already started bringing in some used A319s that were acquired at attractive rates.

So today, we fly a lot of hub to hub between Dallas and Chicago or between Denver and Dallas, we fly regional jets, and that's something that is unique about United that will likely change. In hub-to-hub markets, we'll likely fly bigger airplanes and we'll use our regionals to go fly into places that are smaller cities but that generate higher-yielding connecting revenues for the network.

We have some unsecured that's due in, I think, '18 and '19. We have a number of EETC transactions that pay down according to the initial schedule. So I think at the moment, we don't see any big opportunities to just reduce the debt levels, but we're very comfortable with where they are. We certainly are going to be mindful to keep it conservative. That doesn't mean that we won't look at more leverage. But as we sit here right now, getting our arms around the business and trying to come up with the game plan as we go forward, which we'll share a lot of that in a month from now, I don't expect any significant changes in -- at least in the next quarter."
