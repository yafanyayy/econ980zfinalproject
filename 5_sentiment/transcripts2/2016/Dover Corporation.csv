174901,321837425,920812,"Dover Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. We delivered fourth quarter ad",831,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. 
We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81 in this environment, driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continue to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation, which increased to $795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment in product innovation and customer activities. 
Additionally, during the year, we took multiple steps to right size our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain a focus in 2016. 
Further, we closed on 4 acquisitions since our last call. These businesses will generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue in 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy exposure and tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remains solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, China markets improved, and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year. 
In Energy, markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the new year. Given that as a backdrop, our team is focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions. Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. 
On the revenue side, we estimate we've generated 5% growth from new business. Much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels. In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and of course, continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coating business. In the industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by strong results in our environmental solutions business. 
Fluids, once again, posted strong margin despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps off a very strong fourth quarter of last year. This solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016. 
As we've discussed, we were able to close several deals as we ended the year. Integration activities are well underway, and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive. 
Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we continue to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets, and we'll remain diligent and disciplined on valuations. 
Now looking to 2016. We expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy, we remain cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions. Providing some offset, we now have better line of sight on incremental new business. Our aggressive pursuit of additional business, expanding our international presence and strong presence -- strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology in new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coating markets to be solid, and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. 
Within our industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in environmental solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity. 
Fluids will grow, driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through scale and efficiencies. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandising solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our food equipment markets. 
In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,321837425,920812,"Dover Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of",1425,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.81 and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of $16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. 
Restructuring activities were broad based, with a continued focus on Energy. Bookings decreased 13% to $1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was once again solid at $274 million for the quarter or 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. 
For the full year, we generated $795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and environmental solutions markets. Fluids declined 6% -- Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2% while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step down in energy markets. Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust environmental solutions orders. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $323 million decreased 41%, driving earnings down to $31 million. Energy results continue to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America. Energy absorbed an additional $4 million in restructuring cost in the fourth quarter and has incurred $31 million in costs for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. We expect the carryover benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately $40 million in 2016. Bookings were $316 million, and book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was $256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coating activity. Acquisitions added 6% growth while FX had an 11% impact. 
In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $342 million, where organic growth was 1% -- of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was once again led by environmental solutions. We incurred $5 million in restructuring cost in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring cost, margins was -- margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions, partially offset by business mix. Bookings were $608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by a 5% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 6%, and industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98 while industrials was 1.05. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Turning to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 6% to $356 million, and earnings decreased 1% to $62 million. Revenue performance reflects a 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our Fluid Transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically while our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments. The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter, resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase accounting and deal costs, margin was 19.3%, reflecting continued strong execution. 
Bookings were $321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $419 million declined 9% from the prior year, and earnings were $43 million. As expected, revenue continue to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can shaping business was improved. Operating margin was 10.2%. Adjusting for $6 million in restructuring cost for the quarter, margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from an adjusted prior year, reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements. 
Bookings were $380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016. 
Now going to the overview Slide #10. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, down $5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25%, excluding discrete tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate, principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act. Of note, our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, a 1 point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets. We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. 
As a reminder, the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5%, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, 1 point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions. 
CapEx remains unchanged as does our full year free cash flow forecast. From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a 3-point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance. 
Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55, around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit. Performance, including changes in volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.23 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completed, including Tokheim, will be about $0.18 accretive. The carryover benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will once again face challenges whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically. Within this environment, we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies, capitalizing on our customer wins mindset by becoming an even more important partner with our customers and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow. The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions. 
Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by 3 significant activities that have already been implemented. They are: the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion, 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08. We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016, and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Paul, let's take some questions."

And in 2015, I think in the second half of the year, we estimate that we had about 5% of our revenue in the second half in Energy with what we labeled as new wins. As we provided guidance and initial guidance at a December meeting, we know we were going to keep the business now we had won in 2015, but we were not including in our guidance any anticipated new business in 2016 unless we actually had a contract or knew we had won  the business. And, Deane, since then, we have won some business. We've got contracts. Some of the business we've actually -- will actually have modest shipments on here in their first quarter, and it's across the segment.

It's just much more difficult to forecast accurately our activity through our distributors and the upstream oil and gas market and some of the other, I call them, second order connected markets than it is with activity direct with the OEMs. But on top of that, we did see an absence of what I would call the normal CapEx spending that you see in the fourth quarter, what I call the year-end capital budget flush out, and there was a little bit different profile in the fourth quarter.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. We delivered fourth quarter ad",829,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. 
We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81 in this environment, driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continue to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation, which increased to $795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment in product innovation and customer activities. 
Additionally, during the year, we took multiple steps to rightsize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain a focus in 2016. 
Further, we closed on 4 acquisitions since our last call. These businesses will generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue in 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure and tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remains solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, China markets improved, and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year. 
In Energy, markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the new year. Given that as a backdrop, our teams focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions. Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines, as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. 
On the revenue side, we estimate we've generated 5% growth from new business, much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels. In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and, of course, continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coating business. In the Industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by strong results in our Environmental Solutions business. 
Fluids, once again, posted strong margin despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps off a very strong fourth quarter of last year. This solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016. 
As we've discussed, we were able to close several deals as we ended the year. Integration activities are well underway, and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive. Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we continue to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets, and we'll remain diligent and disciplined on valuations. 
Now looking to 2016. We expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy, we remain cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions. Providing some offset, we now have better line of sight on incremental new business. Our aggressive pursuit of additional business, expanding our international presence and strong presence -- strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology in new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coating markets to be solid and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our Industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in Environmental Solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity. 
Fluids will grow, driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through scale and efficiencies. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandising solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our food equipment markets.  
In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.81 and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of $16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. Restructuring activities were broad-based, with a continued focus on Energy. 
Bookings decreased 13% to $1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was, once again, solid at $274 million for the quarter or 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. For the full year, we generated $795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and Environmental Solutions markets. Fluids declined 6% -- Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2%, while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step-down in energy markets. Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust Environmental Solutions orders. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $323 million decreased 41%, driving earnings down to $31 million. Energy results continue to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America. Energy absorbed an additional $4 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and has incurred $31 million in costs for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. We expect the carryover benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately $40 million in 2016. Bookings were $316 million, and book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was $256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coating activity. Acquisitions added 6% growth, while FX had an 11% impact. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $342 million, where organic growth was 1% -- of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was, once again, led by Environmental Solutions. We incurred $5 million in restructuring costs in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions, partially offset by business mix. Bookings were $608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by a 5% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 6%, and Industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while Industrials was 1.05. Overall book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Turning to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 6% to $356 million, and earnings decreased 1% to $62 million. Revenue performance reflects a 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our fluids transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically, while our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments. The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter, resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase accounting and deal cost, margin was 19.3%, reflecting continued strong execution. Bookings were $321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $419 million declined 9% from the prior year, and earnings were $43 million. As expected, revenue continue to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can-shaping business was improved. Operating margin was 10.2%. Adjusting for $6 million in restructuring costs for the quarter, margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from an adjusted prior year, reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements. Bookings were $380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016. 
Now going to the overview Slide #10. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, down $5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25% excluding discrete tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate, principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act. Of note, our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, a 1 point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets. We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, at the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5%, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. 
Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, 1 point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions.  CapEx remains unchanged, as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a 3-point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance. 
Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55, around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.23 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completed, including Tokheim, will be about $0.18 accretive. The carryover benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will, once again, face challenges, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically. Within this environment, we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization; expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies; capitalizing on our customer wins mindset by becoming an even more important partner with our customers; and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow. The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions. 
Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by 3 significant activities that have already been implemented. They are the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion, 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08. We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016, and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary.

And my second comment is we don't always control the timing of the opportunities. In fact, if I remind people here, it's rare for us to control the timing, when we get to say yes or no. I am a little cautious right now with respect to valuations because I think the sort of the downdraft on public company valuations is not very well reflected in the, I would call it, in private companies that are -- that may be for sale. So we're being a bit cautious here with our outlook here over the next 3 or 4 months. And then, of course, that brings up the question of share repurchases, and look, all I can tell you is look at our history. We have been quite balanced between M&A and share repurchases over the last 3 or 4 years. You should expect us to be as disciplined and balanced over the next 2 or 3 as we have been over the last 2 or 3, but we're not announcing any share repurchase activity today, perhaps more on that over the next 2 or 3 months."

And this is a Fluids comment, within the Fluids segment. Almost all of that restructuring is in Europe and China, interestingly enough. And some of the benefits that we will achieve with the restructuring in China is actually being reallocated to increase our customer-facing and customer service capabilities in China. There are opportunities for growth, but I'm not going to label the change we saw in the fourth quarter as a groundswell change."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. We delivered fourth quarter ad",829,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. 
We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81 in this environment, driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continue to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation, which increased to $795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment in product innovation and customer activities. 
Additionally, during the year, we took multiple steps to rightsize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain a focus in 2016. 
Further, we closed on 4 acquisitions since our last call. These businesses will generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue in 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure and tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, China markets improved, and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year. 
In Energy, markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the new year. Given that as a backdrop, our teams focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions. Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines, as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. 
On the revenue side, we estimate we've generated 5% growth from new business, much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels. In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and, of course, continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by strong results in our Environmental Solutions business. 
Fluids, once again, posted strong margin despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps off a very strong fourth quarter of last year. This solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016. 
As we've discussed, we were able to close several deals as we ended the year. Integration activities are well underway, and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive. Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we continue to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets, and we'll remain diligent and disciplined on valuations. 
Now looking to 2016. We expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy, we remain cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions. Providing some offset, we now have better line of sight on incremental new business. Our aggressive pursuit of additional business, expanding our international presence and strong presence -- strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology in new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coding markets to be solid and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our Industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in Environmental Solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity. 
Fluids will grow, driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through scale and efficiencies. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandising solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our food equipment markets.  
In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of",1420,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.81 and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of $16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. Restructuring activities were broad-based, with a continued focus on Energy. 
Bookings decreased 13% to $1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was, once again, solid at $274 million for the quarter or 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. For the full year, we generated $795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and Environmental Solutions markets. Fluids declined 6% -- Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2%, while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step-down in energy markets. Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust Environmental Solutions orders. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $323 million decreased 41%, driving earnings down to $31 million. Energy results continue to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America. Energy absorbed an additional $4 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and has incurred $31 million in costs for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. We expect the carryover benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately $40 million in 2016. Bookings were $316 million, and book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was $256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coding activity. Acquisitions added 6% growth, while FX had an 11% impact. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $342 million, where organic growth was 1% -- of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was, once again, led by Environmental Solutions. We incurred $5 million in restructuring costs in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions, partially offset by business mix. Bookings were $608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by a 5% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 6%, and Industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while Industrials was 1.05. Overall book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Turning to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 6% to $356 million, and earnings decreased 1% to $62 million. Revenue performance reflects a 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our fluids transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically, while our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments. The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter, resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase accounting and deal costs, margin was 19.3%, reflecting continued strong execution. Bookings were $321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $419 million declined 9% from the prior year, and earnings were $43 million. As expected, revenue continued to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can-shaping business was improved. Operating margin was 10.2%. Adjusting for $6 million in restructuring costs for the quarter, margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from an adjusted prior year, reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements. Bookings were $380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016. 
Now going to the overview Slide #10. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, down $5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25% excluding discrete tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate, principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act. Of note, our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, a 1 point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets. We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, at the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5%, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. 
Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, 1 point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions.  CapEx remains unchanged, as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a 3-point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance. 
Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55, around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.23 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completed, including Tokheim, will be about $0.18 accretive. The carryover benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will, once again, face challenges, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically. Within this environment, we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization; expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies; capitalizing on our customer wins mind-set by becoming an even more important partner with our customers; and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow. The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions. 
Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by 3 significant activities that have already been implemented. They are the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion, 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08. We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016, and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary.

And in 2015, I think in the second half of the year, we estimate that we had about 5% of our revenue in the second half in Energy with what we've labeled as new wins. As we provided guidance and initial guidance at the December meeting, we knew we were going to keep the business that we had won in 2015, but we were not including in our guidance any anticipated new business in 2016 unless we actually had a contract or knew we had won the business. And Deane, since then, we have won some business. We've got contracts. Some of the business we've actually -- we'll actually have modest shipments on here in the first quarter, and it's across the segment. Specifically within the upstream market, we continue to win new business within our -- with our PDC insert business, but it is most noticeable within our artificial lift business.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. We delivered fourth quarter ad",829,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. 
We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81 in this environment, driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continue to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation, which increased to $795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment in product innovation and customer activities. 
Additionally, during the year, we took multiple steps to rightsize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain a focus in 2016. 
Further, we closed on 4 acquisitions since our last call. These businesses will generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue in 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure and tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, China markets improved, and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year. 
In Energy, markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the new year. Given that as a backdrop, our teams focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions. Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines, as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. 
On the revenue side, we estimate we've generated 5% growth from new business, much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels. In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and, of course, continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by strong results in our Environmental Solutions business. 
Fluids, once again, posted strong margin despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps off a very strong fourth quarter of last year. This solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016. 
As we've discussed, we were able to close several deals as we ended the year. Integration activities are well underway, and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive. Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we continue to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets, and we'll remain diligent and disciplined on valuations. 
Now looking to 2016. We expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy, we remain cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions. Providing some offset, we now have better line of sight on incremental new business. Our aggressive pursuit of additional business, expanding our international presence and strong presence -- strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology in new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coding markets to be solid and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our Industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in Environmental Solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity. 
Fluids will grow, driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through scale and efficiencies. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandising solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our food equipment markets.  
In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of",1420,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.81 and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of $16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. Restructuring activities were broad-based, with a continued focus on Energy. 
Bookings decreased 13% to $1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was, once again, solid at $274 million for the quarter or 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. For the full year, we generated $795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and Environmental Solutions markets. Fluids declined 6% -- Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2%, while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step-down in energy markets. Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust Environmental Solutions orders. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $323 million decreased 41%, driving earnings down to $31 million. Energy results continue to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America. Energy absorbed an additional $4 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and has incurred $31 million in costs for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. We expect the carryover benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately $40 million in 2016. Bookings were $316 million, and book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was $256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coding activity. Acquisitions added 6% growth, while FX had an 11% impact. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $342 million, where organic growth was 1% -- of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was, once again, led by Environmental Solutions. We incurred $5 million in restructuring costs in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions, partially offset by business mix. Bookings were $608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by a 5% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 6%, and Industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while Industrials was 1.05. Overall book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Turning to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 6% to $356 million, and earnings decreased 1% to $62 million. Revenue performance reflects a 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our fluids transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically, while our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments. The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter, resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase accounting and deal costs, margin was 19.3%, reflecting continued strong execution. Bookings were $321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $419 million declined 9% from the prior year, and earnings were $43 million. As expected, revenue continued to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can-shaping business was improved. Operating margin was 10.2%. Adjusting for $6 million in restructuring costs for the quarter, margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from an adjusted prior year, reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements. Bookings were $380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016. 
Now going to the overview Slide #10. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, down $5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25% excluding discrete tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate, principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act. Of note, our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, a 1 point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets. We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, at the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5%, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. 
Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, 1 point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions.  CapEx remains unchanged, as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a 3-point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance. 
Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55, around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.23 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completed, including Tokheim, will be about $0.18 accretive. The carryover benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will, once again, face challenges, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically. Within this environment, we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization; expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies; capitalizing on our customer wins mind-set by becoming an even more important partner with our customers; and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow. The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions. 
Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by 3 significant activities that have already been implemented. They are the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion, 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08. We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016, and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary.

And in 2015, I think in the second half of the year, we estimate that we had about 5% of our revenue in the second half in Energy with what we've labeled as new wins. As we provided guidance and initial guidance at the December meeting, we knew we were going to keep the business that we had won in 2015, but we were not including in our guidance any anticipated new business in 2016 unless we actually had a contract or knew we had won the business.

It's just much more difficult to forecast accurately our activity through our distributors in the upstream oil and gas market and some of the other, I call them, second order connected markets than it is with activity direct with the OEMs. But on top of that, we did see an absence of what I would call the normal CapEx spending that you see in the fourth quarter, what I call year-end capital budget flush-out, and there was a -- it was a little bit different profile in the fourth quarter.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. We delivered fourth quarter ad",829,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions, especially in oil and gas. 
We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81 in this environment, driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continue to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation, which increased to $795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment in product innovation and customer activities. 
Additionally, during the year, we took multiple steps to rightsize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain a focus in 2016. 
Further, we closed on 4 acquisitions since our last call. These businesses will generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue in 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure and tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, China markets improved, and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year. 
In Energy, markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the new year. Given that as a backdrop, our teams focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions. Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines, as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. 
On the revenue side, we estimate we've generated 5% growth from new business, much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels. In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and, of course, continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by strong results in our Environmental Solutions business. 
Fluids, once again, posted strong margin despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps off a very strong fourth quarter of last year. This solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016. 
As we've discussed, we were able to close several deals as we ended the year. Integration activities are well underway, and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive. Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we continue to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets, and we'll remain diligent and disciplined on valuations. 
Now looking to 2016. We expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy, we remain cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions. Providing some offset, we now have better line of sight on incremental new business. Our aggressive pursuit of additional business, expanding our international presence and strong presence -- strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology in new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coding markets to be solid and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our Industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in Environmental Solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity. 
Fluids will grow, driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through scale and efficiencies. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandising solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our food equipment markets.  
In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,321837425,924314,"Dover Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of",1420,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.81 and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of $16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. Restructuring activities were broad-based, with a continued focus on Energy. 
Bookings decreased 13% to $1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was, once again, solid at $274 million for the quarter or 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. For the full year, we generated $795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and Environmental Solutions markets. Fluids declined 6% -- Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2%, while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step-down in energy markets. Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust Environmental Solutions orders. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $323 million decreased 41%, driving earnings down to $31 million. Energy results continue to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America. Energy absorbed an additional $4 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and has incurred $31 million in costs for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. We expect the carryover benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately $40 million in 2016. Bookings were $316 million, and book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was $256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coding activity. Acquisitions added 6% growth, while FX had an 11% impact. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $342 million, where organic growth was 1% -- of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was, once again, led by Environmental Solutions. We incurred $5 million in restructuring costs in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring costs, margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions, partially offset by business mix. Bookings were $608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by a 5% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 6%, and Industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while Industrials was 1.05. Overall book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Turning to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 6% to $356 million, and earnings decreased 1% to $62 million. Revenue performance reflects a 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our fluids transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically, while our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments. The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter, resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase accounting and deal costs, margin was 19.3%, reflecting continued strong execution. Bookings were $321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $419 million declined 9% from the prior year, and earnings were $43 million. As expected, revenue continued to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can-shaping business was improved. Operating margin was 10.2%. Adjusting for $6 million in restructuring costs for the quarter, margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from an adjusted prior year, reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements. Bookings were $380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016. 
Now going to the overview Slide #10. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, down $5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25% excluding discrete tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate, principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act. Of note, our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, a 1 point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets. We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, at the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5%, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. 
Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, 1 point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions.  CapEx remains unchanged, as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a 3-point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance. 
Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55, around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.23 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completed, including Tokheim, will be about $0.18 accretive. The carryover benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will, once again, face challenges, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically. Within this environment, we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization; expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies; capitalizing on our customer wins mind-set by becoming an even more important partner with our customers; and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow. The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions. 
Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by 3 significant activities that have already been implemented. They are the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion, 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08. We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016, and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary.

And in 2015, I think in the second half of the year, we estimate that we had about 5% of our revenue in the second half in Energy with what we've labeled as new wins. As we provided guidance and initial guidance at the December meeting, we knew we were going to keep the business that we had won in 2015, but we were not including in our guidance any anticipated new business in 2016 unless we actually had a contract or knew we had won the business. And Deane, since then, we have won some business. We've got contracts. Some of the business we've actually -- we'll actually have modest shipments on here in the first quarter, and it's across the segment.

We see that continuing in '16. And in fact, I would tell you I think we're being -- overall, I believe, sitting here today, we're being cautious with respect to Fluids and our guide for '16 because of that. It's just much more difficult to forecast accurately our activity through our distributors in the upstream oil and gas market and some of the other, I call them, second order connected markets than it is with activity direct with the OEMs. But on top of that, we did see an absence of what I would call the normal CapEx spending that you see in the fourth quarter, what I call year-end capital budget flush-out, and there was a -- it was a little bit different profile in the fourth quarter.

I am a little cautious right now with respect to valuations because I think the sort of the downdraft on public company valuations is not very well reflected in the, I would call it, in private companies that are -- that may be for sale. So we're being a bit cautious here with our outlook here over the next 3 or 4 months. And then, of course, that brings up the question of share repurchases, and look, all I can tell you is look at our history.

Or do we need to see more dramatic cost takeout? Because it just seems like $2 million relative to your annual revenue rate, any decline in the dramatic step-down in rigs that we've had and the dramatic step-down in oil price, is just a little bit light to help us feel good about the margin trajectory for next year."

As previously communicated, our first quarter was well below our initial expectations, driven by significant further reductions in activity and capital spending within our U.S. oil- and gas-related end markets. These conditions primarily impacted our Energy segment and to a lesser extent, Fluids. 
The markets served by Engineering Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained solid, resulting in organic growth of 3% in each segment. In total, we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 and took further steps to reduce our costs and rightsize our businesses. 
In addition to introducing new products and pursuing share gains, we are increasing our restructuring actions and have stepped up our efforts on productivity, including shared services. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. Industrial activity remained solid and grew organically low single digits year-over-year. Both our China and European markets were down sequentially and also down organically from the prior year. 
In Energy, markets further deteriorated as we moved through the quarter. Market activity levels hit new lows on continued declines in the U.S. rig count and reduced capital spending, which, in turn, drove our first quarter revenue and earnings down significantly. Our teams have remained resolute on actions to drive sales and share gains and in reducing all nonessential costs while still maintaining their engineering talent and ability to respond to customer opportunities. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 3%. Within Printing & Identification, we once again posted solid results in our core marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, organic growth was broad based. Fluids posted strong revenue growth, driven by the recent acquisitions of Tokheim, Gala and Reduction. 
On an organic basis, our businesses with the direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers especially within retail fueling, posted declines. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 3% organically, largely driven by retail refrigeration. Revenue and earnings performance was as expected, benefiting from our customer expansion efforts taken over the last several quarters. Regarding acquisitions, we believe we have line of sight on several deals over the next few quarters in our key growth markets. 
Now looking forward. Within Energy, as a result of further U.S. market declines, we have reduced our organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to be down 27% to 30% for the full year. On a sequential basis, the first quarter was down 12%. We now expect the second quarter to sequentially decline another 10%. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged, driven by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. We expect the marking and coding business to grow low to mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. 
Within our Industrial platform, we expect modest, broad-based growth. Fluids will grow this year, driven by the recent acquisitions, which should generate roughly $400 million in revenue in 2016. We also expect solid to strong growth from our industrial, hygienic and pharma markets. Overall, organic revenue is expected to be a few points lower than previously forecasted as a result of direct oil and gas exposure, lower CapEx spending from integrated Energy customers and project timing. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, our plans for organic revenue growth and margin improvement remain on track heading into the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Our leading technology and merchandising solutions are resulting in customer wins at several regional and national food retail chains. 
In summary, we are lowering our full year EPS guidance to reflect the impact of oil and gas markets. Our full year guidance includes $40 million of restructuring costs, which will deliver significant benefits on an annualized basis. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad for further comments."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7% and an FX impact of 1%. Growth",1397,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7% and an FX impact of 1%. Growth from acquisitions of 6% less dispositions resulted in net acquisition growth of 3%. 
EPS was $0.64 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits and a $0.07 gain from a disposition. Segment margin for the quarter was 11.7%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for first quarter restructuring of approximately $14 million, margin was 12.5%. Restructuring activities were primarily focused within our Energy and Fluids segments. 
Bookings decreased 4% over the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 4% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic booking in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% and 5%, respectively. Overall, book to bill finished at 1.03, up slightly from last year. Our backlog decreased 10% to $1.1 billion and was down 6%, excluding dispositions. 
Free cash flow was $96 million or 6% of revenue, consistent with the prior year first quarter. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment both increased organic revenue 3%. This increase reflects broad-based growth across Engineered Systems and in retail refrigeration and can-shaping businesses of Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Fluids organic decline of 3% was driven by oil and gas markets and slower CapEx spending in select Fluid Transfer markets. Energy organic revenue was down 33% on further declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, net acquisition growth was most prevalent at Fluids with 22% growth, principally driven by Tokheim. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $283 million decreased 34%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $11 million. Energy's results continue to be further impacted by decline in oil and gas market fundamentals, especially the U.S. rig count. Energy incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs. Since the beginning of the oil and gas downturn in 2014, this segment has reduced their workforce by 32% or 2,100 people. 
Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 6%, reflecting volume and price declines. We expect to complete additional cost actions in the second quarter and exit 2016 at around 10% margin. Bookings were $273 million, and book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $577 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3% and unfavorable FX of 2%. Net acquisitions were neutral, where the acquisition growth of JK was essentially offset by the revenue connected with the sale of the business. Earnings of $94 million increased 6%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity and organic volume leverage. Of note, $11 million gain on the disposition was principally offset by increased costs associated with a factory, a recent factory consolidation and other onetime items. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $240 million increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 1%, primarily reflecting solid North American marking and coding markets. Acquisition had 8% growth while FX was 5% negative. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 2% to $337 million, where organic growth of 4% was offset by a $0.05 -- 5% impact from disposition and 1% from FX. Organic growth was broad based. We incurred $2 million in restructuring costs in the quarter. Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, margin was 16.6%. Bookings of $573 million were flat, reflecting organic bookings growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, largely offset by the impact of the disposition and FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were essentially flat, and Industrial bookings increased 6%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01 while Industrials was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.99. 
Now on Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $399 million while earnings decreased 16% to $46 million. Revenue performance reflects 22% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by 3% decline in organic revenue and 2% from FX. Our Fluids transfer and pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets, reduced capital spending and the timing of orders, partially offset by solid results in industrial, hygienic and pharma markets. Lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions and $3 million of incremental restructuring costs reduced margin 460 basis points in the quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was 17.5%, an increase of 70 basis points over an adjusted prior year. Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 23%. This result primarily reflects the positive impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings were flat. Book-to-bill was 1.05. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $363 million declined 2% from the prior year, and earnings were $38 million, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue growth of 3% was largely driven by wins at several retail refrigeration customers. We also had solid results in our glass door and can-shaping equipment businesses. Overall, the disposition of our walk-in cooler product line and FX impacted revenue 5% and 1%, respectively. 
Operating margin was 10.5%, an 80 basis point increase over last year. This improvement was largely driven by the benefits of productivity and leverage on organic growth. Bookings of $411 million were down 2%. This result reflects 5% organic growth, offset by a 6% impact of the disposition and 1% from FX. Book-to-bill was 1.13, reflecting normal seasonality in the retail refrigeration market. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $30 million, and net interest expense was $32 million, both in line with our prior forecast. Our first quarter tax rate was 27.9%, excluding discrete tax benefits. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been lowered to reflect the oil and gas markets. We now expect total revenue to decrease 2% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 5% to 8%, a 4-point reduction from our prior forecast. We expect net acquisitions will add approximately 4% growth, unchanged from our prior guidance. We now expect the impact of FX to be about 1% negative for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%. 
Excluding restructuring costs and further adjusting for acquisition and purchase accounting, margin is expected to be around 16%. Our full year forecast for corporate expense, interest expense and the discrete tax rate remains unchanged. Additionally, CapEx remains unchanged as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 27% to 30%. We have also reduced Fluids organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to decline 2% to 5%. Engineering Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment is unchanged versus our prior guidance. Net acquisitions remain at 4% growth. 
Turning to the bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide a $0.07 benefit, reflecting total 2016 restructuring costs of $40 million versus $55 million last year. A revised forecast reflects $20 million or $0.09 EPS in incremental restructuring costs versus the prior forecast. 
Performance, including changes in volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.09 to $0.17. This is reduced from our previous forecast, principally driven by the effect of lower volume. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.19 to $0.22, reflecting roughly $0.07 of reduced spend. Acquisitions, less dispositions, will be $0.16 to $0.17 accretive in total. This amount includes the operating earnings of acquisitions less dispositions and the related gain. The carryover benefit of prior year share repurchases, the impact of interest, corporate expense and tax rate are all unchanged. 
Lastly, as I mentioned before, that we had a discrete tax benefit of $0.05 in the quarter. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.51 to $3.66, down about $0.50 at the midpoint of our prior guidance, excluding the gain on a disposition and discrete tax benefits. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Businesses with exposure to oil and gas continue to be impacted by historically weak markets. 
Engineered Systems is benefiting from solid industrial end markets, healthy printing and coding end markets and the continued growth in adoption of digital printing and global textile activity. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment is also quite resilient, due in part to their leading retail refrigeration technologies that helps our customers capitalize on the growing trend of selling prepared and fresh food. 
Within Fluids, although it's early, we are very excited about the consumer response to our recent acquisitions. Within retail fueling, customers are now asking us to provide our full scope of products. We are also seeing revenue synergies at our plastics and polymer customers with the addition of Gala and Reduction. 
We will continue to execute on initiatives to help drive growth and fund investments, mainly launching new products across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies, leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow and capitalizing on our scale through the establishment of shared service centers. 
In all, leveraging these growth opportunities and executing on our internal actions will help mitigate mixed markets, drive productivity and redirect resources to pursue growth initiatives. We also expect to fully leverage the recovery in our oil and gas markets when it comes. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. And Paul, let's take some questions."

You look at the second half, the second half revenue is closely aligned with what we view as the run rate for the second quarter, and I would add one color comment on that. In the second half, we do have about $45 million of share gain revenue sort of split evenly between the third and fourth quarter on wins that we've won and we have line of sight to. Absent the share gain wins, the revenue in the second half would be modestly below the second quarter run rate. On margins for the year, margins are going to -- at the top end of our guide, margins are about 6% or 6.5%, all in, all in, including restructuring.

But you do get the normal amortization of the goodwill and actually the intangibles. So the inventory piece, I would say first quarter has been impacted by roughly $6 million or $7 million of inventory, and that doesn't repeat itself into the second or third, fourth quarters. And then, if you think about margins as well on restructuring, we said restructuring's going to be $40 million. If you think about how that's going to get spent, we had $14 million or so in the first quarter. I would expect by the time we finish the second quarter, we'll be about $35 million or so of that $40 million spent. So again, as I start to look at first half, second half, even for the company, the first half, second half is not traditional, what I would say, is the split between first half and second half at 48%, 52%, it's showing up in our guide right now at about a 43%, 47% -- 57%. But if you adjust for these one-offs that you're asking about in restructuring and then we look at it at that level, you'd have closer to a 45%, 46%, first half."

And what we have tried to protect very diligently, and I commented on this in the script as well as our engineering capability and our ability to respond pretty quickly. So when I say what we can take advantage of the recovery and leverage the recovery well when it does come, part of it's around our response capability, but we have taken enough fixed cost side of this business in '15 and '16 that the incrementals on a volume increase are going to be rather impressive."

I think it's much more extensive than that, and I think actually by the time we get to year-end '16, we'll probably -- we'll have one segment pretty much fully transitioned to the shared service approach, and the other 3, perhaps 30% to 50% transition to the shared service platform.

As previously communicated, our first quarter was well below our initial expectations, driven by significant further reductions in activity and capital spending within our U.S. oil and gas-related end markets. These conditions primarily impacted our Energy segment and, to a lesser extent, Fluids. 
The markets served by Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained solid, resulting in organic growth of 3% in each segment. In total, we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 and took further steps to reduce our cost and rightsize our businesses. 
In addition to introducing new products and pursuing share gains, we are increasing our restructuring actions and have stepped up our efforts on productivity, including shared services. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew organically low single digits year-over-year. Both our China and European markets were down sequentially and also down organically from the prior year. 
In Energy, markets further deteriorated as we moved through the quarter. Market activity levels hit new lows on continued declines in the U.S. rig count and reduced capital spending, which, in turn, drove our first quarter revenue and earnings down significantly. Our teams have remained resolute on actions to drive sales and share gains and in reducing all nonessential cost while still maintaining their engineering talent and ability to respond to customer opportunities. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 3%. Within Printing & Identification, we once again posted solid results in our core marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, organic growth was broad-based. Fluids posted strong revenue growth, driven by the recent acquisitions of Tokheim, Gala and Reduction. 
On an organic basis, our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers, especially within retail fueling, posted declines. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 3% organically, largely driven by retail refrigeration. Revenue and earnings performance was as expected, benefiting from our customer expansion efforts taken over the last several quarters. Regarding acquisitions, we believe we have line of sight on several deals over the next few quarters in our key growth markets. 
Now looking forward. Within Energy, as a result of further U.S. market declines, we have reduced our organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to be down 27% to 30% for the full year. On a sequential basis, the first quarter was down 12%. We now expect the second quarter to sequentially decline another 10%. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged, driven by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. We expect the marking and coding business to grow low to mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. 
Within our Industrial platform, we expect modest, broad-based growth. Fluids will grow this year, driven by the recent acquisitions, which should generate roughly $400 million in revenue in 2016. We also expect solid to strong growth from our industrial, hygienic and pharma markets. Overall, organic revenue is expected to be a few points lower than previously forecasted as a result of direct oil and gas exposure, lower CapEx spending from integrated Energy customers and project timing. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, our plans for organic revenue growth and margin improvement remain on track heading into the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Our leading technology and merchandising solutions are resulting in customer wins at several regional and national food retail chains. 
In summary, we are lowering our full year EPS guidance to reflect the impact of oil and gas markets. Our full year guidance includes $40 million of restructuring cost, which will deliver significant benefits on an annualized basis. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad for further comments."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7% and an FX impact of 1%. Growth",1401,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7% and an FX impact of 1%. Growth from acquisitions of 6% less dispositions resulted in net acquisition growth of 3%. 
EPS was $0.64 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits and a $0.07 gain from a disposition. Segment margin for the quarter was 11.7%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for first quarter restructuring of approximately $14 million, margin was 12.5%. Restructuring activities were primarily focused within our Energy and Fluids segments. 
Bookings decreased 4% over the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 4% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% and 5%, respectively. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.03, up slightly from last year. Our backlog decreased 10% to $1.1 billion and was down 6%, excluding dispositions. 
Free cash flow was $96 million or 6% of revenue, consistent with the prior year first quarter. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment both increased organic revenue 3%. This increase reflects broad-based growth across Engineered Systems and in retail refrigeration and can-shaping businesses of Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Fluids' organic decline of 3% was driven by oil and gas markets and slower CapEx spending in select fluid transfer markets. Energy organic revenue was down 33% on further declines in the North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, net acquisition growth was most prevalent at Fluids with 22% growth, principally driven by Tokheim. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $283 million decreased 34%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $11 million. Energy's results continued to be further impacted by declines in oil and gas market fundamentals, especially the U.S. rig count. Energy incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs. Since the beginning of the oil and gas downturn in 2014, this segment has reduced their workforce by 32% or 2,100 people. 
Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 6%, reflecting volume and price declines. We expect to complete additional cost actions in the second quarter and exit 2016 at around 10% margin. Bookings were $273 million, and book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $577 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3% and unfavorable FX of 2%. Net acquisitions were neutral, where the acquisition growth of JK was essentially offset by the revenue connected with the sale of the business. Earnings of $94 million increased 6%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity and organic volume leverage. Of note, $11 million gain on the disposition was principally offset by increased costs associated with a factory -- a recent factory consolidation and other onetime items. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $240 million increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 1%, primarily reflecting solid North American marking and coding markets. Acquisitions added 8% growth while FX was 5% negative. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 2% to $337 million, where organic growth of 4% was offset by a $0.05 -- 5% impact from a disposition and a -- and 1% from FX. Organic growth was broad-based. We incurred $2 million in restructuring costs in the quarter. Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, margin was 16.6%. Bookings of $573 million were flat, reflecting organic bookings growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, largely offset by the impact of a disposition and FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were essentially flat and Industrial bookings increased 6%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01 while Industrials was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.99. 
Now on Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $399 million while earnings decreased 16% to $46 million. Revenue performance reflects 22% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic revenue and 2% from FX. Our fluids transfer and pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets, reduced capital spending and the timing of orders, partially offset by solid results in industrial, hygienic and pharma markets. Lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions and $3 million of incremental restructuring costs reduced margin 460 basis points in the quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was 17.5%, an increase of 70 basis points over an adjusted prior year. Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 23%. This result primarily reflects the positive impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings were flat. Book-to-bill was 1.05. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $363 million declined 2% from the prior year, and earnings were $38 million, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue growth of 3% was largely driven by wins at several retail refrigeration customers. We also had solid results in our glass door and can-shaping equipment businesses. Overall, the disposition of our walk-in cooler product line and FX impacted revenue 5% and 1%, respectively. 
Operating margin was 10.5%, an 80 basis point increase over last year. This improvement was largely driven by the benefits of productivity and leverage on organic growth. Bookings of $411 million were down 2%. This result reflects 5% organic growth, offset by a 6% impact of a disposition and 1% from FX. Book-to-bill was 1.13, reflecting normal seasonality in the retail refrigeration market. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $30 million and net interest expense was $32 million, both in line with our prior forecast. Our first quarter tax rate was 27.9%, excluding discrete tax benefits. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been lowered to reflect the oil and gas markets. We now expect total revenue to decrease 2% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 5% to 8%, a 4-point reduction from our prior forecast. We expect net acquisitions will add approximately 4% growth, unchanged from our prior guidance. We now expect the impact of FX to be about 1% negative for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%. 
Excluding restructuring costs and further adjusting for acquisition and purchase accounting, margin is expected to be around 16%. 
Our full year forecast for corporate expense, interest expense and the pre-discrete tax rate remains unchanged. Additionally, CapEx remains unchanged, as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 27% to 30%. We have also reduced Fluids organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to decline 2% to 5%. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment is unchanged versus our prior guidance. Net acquisitions remain at 4% growth. 
Turning to the bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide a $0.07 benefit, reflecting total 2016 restructuring costs of $40 million versus $55 million last year. Our revised forecast reflects $20 million or $0.09 EPS in incremental restructuring costs versus the prior forecast. 
Performance, including changes in volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.09 to $0.17. This is reduced from our previous forecast, principally driven by the effect of lower volume. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.19 to $0.22, reflecting roughly $0.07 of reduced spend. Acquisitions less dispositions will be $0.16 to $0.17 accretive in total. This amount includes the operating earnings of acquisitions less dispositions and the related gain. The carryover benefit of prior year share repurchases, the impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate are all unchanged. 
Lastly, as I mentioned before, we had a discrete tax benefit of $0.05 in the quarter. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.51 to $3.66, down about $0.50 at the midpoint of our prior guidance, excluding the gain on a disposition and discrete tax benefits. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Businesses with exposure to oil and gas continue to be impacted by historically weak markets. 
Engineered Systems is benefiting from solid industrial end markets, healthy printing and coding end markets and the continued growth in adoption of digital printing and global textile activity. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment is also quite resilient, due in part to their leading retail refrigeration technologies that helps our customers capitalize on the growing trend of selling prepared and fresh food. 
Within Fluids, although it's early, we are very excited about the customer response to our recent acquisitions. Within retail fueling, customers are now asking us to provide our full scope of products. We are also seeing revenue synergies at our plastics and polymer customers with the addition of Gala and Reduction. 
We will continue to execute on initiatives to help drive growth and fund investments, namely, launching new products across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies, leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow and capitalizing on our scale through the establishment of shared service centers. 
In all, leveraging these growth opportunities and executing on our internal actions will help mitigate mixed markets, drive productivity and redirect resources to pursue growth initiatives. We also expect to fully leverage the recovery in our oil and gas markets when it comes.

Steve, I think, in my script, I commented on our sequential decline in our first quarter of 12% and that we are anticipating another sequential decline in the second quarter of about 10%. You look at the second half, the second half revenue is closely aligned with what we view as the run rate for the second quarter. And I would add one color comment on that. In the second half, we do have about $45 million of share gain revenue, sort of split evenly between the third and fourth quarter, on wins that we've won and we have line of sight to. Absent the share gain wins, the revenue in the second half would be modestly below the second quarter run rate. On margins, for the year, margins are going to -- I think, at the top end of our guide, margins are about 6% or 6.5%."

But you do get the normal amortization of the goodwill and the -- actually, the intangibles. So the inventory piece, I would say first quarter has been impacted by roughly $6 million or $7 million of inventory, and that doesn't repeat itself into the second or third, fourth quarters. And then, if you think about margins as well on restructuring, we said restructuring's going to be $40 million. If you think about how that's going to get spent, we had $14 million or so in the first quarter. I would expect, by the time we finish the second quarter, we'll be about $35 million or so of that $40 million spent."

As previously communicated, our first quarter was well below our initial expectations, driven by significant further reductions in activity and capital spending within our U.S. oil and gas-related end markets. These conditions primarily impacted our Energy segment and, to a lesser extent, Fluids. 
The markets served by Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained solid, resulting in organic growth of 3% in each segment. In total, we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 and took further steps to reduce our cost and rightsize our businesses. 
In addition to introducing new products and pursuing share gains, we are increasing our restructuring actions and have stepped up our efforts on productivity, including shared services. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew organically low single digits year-over-year. Both our China and European markets were down sequentially and also down organically from the prior year. 
In Energy, markets further deteriorated as we moved through the quarter. Market activity levels hit new lows on continued declines in the U.S. rig count and reduced capital spending, which, in turn, drove our first quarter revenue and earnings down significantly. Our teams have remained resolute on actions to drive sales and share gains and in reducing all nonessential cost while still maintaining their engineering talent and ability to respond to customer opportunities. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 3%. Within Printing & Identification, we once again posted solid results in our core marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, organic growth was broad-based. Fluids posted strong revenue growth, driven by the recent acquisitions of Tokheim, Gala and Reduction. 
On an organic basis, our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers, especially within retail fueling, posted declines. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 3% organically, largely driven by retail refrigeration. Revenue and earnings performance was as expected, benefiting from our customer expansion efforts taken over the last several quarters. Regarding acquisitions, we believe we have line of sight on several deals over the next few quarters in our key growth markets. 
Now looking forward. Within Energy, as a result of further U.S. market declines, we have reduced our organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to be down 27% to 30% for the full year. On a sequential basis, the first quarter was down 12%. We now expect the second quarter to sequentially decline another 10%. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged, driven by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. We expect the marking and coding business to grow low to mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. 
Within our Industrial platform, we expect modest, broad-based growth. Fluids will grow this year, driven by the recent acquisitions, which should generate roughly $400 million in revenue in 2016. We also expect solid to strong growth from our industrial, hygienic and pharma markets. Overall, organic revenue is expected to be a few points lower than previously forecasted as a result of direct oil and gas exposure, lower CapEx spending from integrated Energy customers and project timing. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, our plans for organic revenue growth and margin improvement remain on track heading into the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Our leading technology and merchandising solutions are resulting in customer wins at several regional and national food retail chains. 
In summary, we are lowering our full year EPS guidance to reflect the impact of oil and gas markets. Our full year guidance includes $40 million of restructuring cost, which will deliver significant benefits on an annualized basis. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad for further comments."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7% and an FX impact of 1%. Growth",1400,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7% and an FX impact of 1%. Growth from acquisitions of 6% less dispositions resulted in net acquisition growth of 3%. 
EPS was $0.64 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits and a $0.07 gain from a disposition. Segment margin for the quarter was 11.7%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for first quarter restructuring of approximately $14 million, margin was 12.5%. Restructuring activities were primarily focused within our Energy and Fluids segments. 
Bookings decreased 4% over the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 4% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% and 5%, respectively. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.03, up slightly from last year. Our backlog decreased 10% to $1.1 billion and was down 6%, excluding dispositions. 
Free cash flow was $96 million or 6% of revenue, consistent with the prior year first quarter. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment both increased organic revenue 3%. This increase reflects broad-based growth across Engineered Systems and in retail refrigeration and can-shaping businesses of Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Fluids' organic decline of 3% was driven by oil and gas markets and slower CapEx spending in select fluid transfer markets. Energy organic revenue was down 33% on further declines in the North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, net acquisition growth was most prevalent at Fluids with 22% growth, principally driven by Tokheim. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $283 million decreased 34%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $11 million. Energy's results continued to be further impacted by declines in oil and gas market fundamentals, especially the U.S. rig count. Energy incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs. Since the beginning of the oil and gas downturn in 2014, this segment has reduced their workforce by 32% or 2,100 people. 
Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 6%, reflecting volume and price declines. We expect to complete additional cost actions in the second quarter and exit 2016 at around 10% margin. Bookings were $273 million, and book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $577 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3% and unfavorable FX of 2%. Net acquisitions were neutral, where the acquisition growth of JK was essentially offset by the revenue connected with the sale of the business. Earnings of $94 million increased 6%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity and organic volume leverage. Of note, $11 million gain on the disposition was principally offset by increased costs associated with a factory -- a recent factory consolidation and other onetime items. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $240 million increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 1%, primarily reflecting solid North American marking and coding markets. Acquisitions added 8% growth while FX was 5% negative. 
In the Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 2% to $337 million, where organic growth of 4% was offset by a $0.05 -- 5% impact from a disposition and a -- and 1% from FX. Organic growth was broad-based. We incurred $2 million in restructuring costs in the quarter. Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, margin was 16.6%. Bookings of $573 million were flat, reflecting organic bookings growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, largely offset by the impact of a disposition and FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were essentially flat and Industrial bookings increased 6%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01 while Industrials was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.99. 
Now on Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $399 million while earnings decreased 16% to $46 million. Revenue performance reflects 22% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic revenue and 2% from FX. Our fluids transfer and pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets, reduced capital spending and the timing of orders, partially offset by solid results in industrial, hygienic and pharma markets. Lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions and $3 million of incremental restructuring costs reduced margin 460 basis points in the quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was 17.5%, an increase of 70 basis points over an adjusted prior year. Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 23%. This result primarily reflects the positive impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings were flat. Book-to-bill was 1.05. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $363 million declined 2% from the prior year, and earnings were $38 million, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue growth of 3% was largely driven by wins at several retail refrigeration customers. We also had solid results in our glass door and can-shaping equipment businesses. Overall, the disposition of our walk-in cooler product line and FX impacted revenue 5% and 1%, respectively. 
Operating margin was 10.5%, an 80 basis point increase over last year. This improvement was largely driven by the benefits of productivity and leverage on organic growth. Bookings of $411 million were down 2%. This result reflects 5% organic growth, offset by a 6% impact of a disposition and 1% from FX. Book-to-bill was 1.13, reflecting normal seasonality in the retail refrigeration market. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $30 million and net interest expense was $32 million, both in line with our prior forecast. Our first quarter tax rate was 27.9%, excluding discrete tax benefits. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been lowered to reflect the oil and gas markets. We now expect total revenue to decrease 2% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 5% to 8%, a 4-point reduction from our prior forecast. We expect net acquisitions will add approximately 4% growth, unchanged from our prior guidance. We now expect the impact of FX to be about 1% negative for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%. 
Excluding restructuring costs and further adjusting for acquisition and purchase accounting, margin is expected to be around 16%. 
Our full year forecast for corporate expense, interest expense and the pre-discrete tax rate remains unchanged. Additionally, CapEx remains unchanged, as does our full year free cash flow forecast. 
From a segment perspective, Energy full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 27% to 30%. We have also reduced Fluids organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to decline 2% to 5%. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment is unchanged versus our prior guidance. Net acquisitions remain at 4% growth. 
Turning to the bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to provide a $0.07 benefit, reflecting total 2016 restructuring costs of $40 million versus $55 million last year. Our revised forecast reflects $20 million or $0.09 EPS in incremental restructuring costs versus the prior forecast. 
Performance, including changes in volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.09 to $0.17. This is reduced from our previous forecast, principally driven by the effect of lower volume. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.19 to $0.22, reflecting roughly $0.07 of reduced spend. Acquisitions less dispositions will be $0.16 to $0.17 accretive in total. This amount includes the operating earnings of acquisitions less dispositions and the related gain. The carryover benefit of prior year share repurchases, the impact of interest, corporate expense and tax rate are all unchanged. 
Lastly, as I mentioned before, we had a discrete tax benefit of $0.05 in the quarter. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.51 to $3.66, down about $0.50 at the midpoint of our prior guidance, excluding the gain on a disposition and discrete tax benefits. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Businesses with exposure to oil and gas continue to be impacted by historically weak markets. 
Engineered Systems is benefiting from solid industrial end markets, healthy printing and coding end markets and the continued growth in adoption of digital printing in global textile activity. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment is also quite resilient, due in part to their leading retail refrigeration technologies that helps our customers capitalize on the growing trend of selling prepared and fresh food. 
Within Fluids, although it's early, we are very excited about the customer response to our recent acquisitions. Within retail fueling, customers are now asking us to provide our full scope of products. We are also seeing revenue synergies at our plastics and polymer customers with the addition of Gala and Reduction. 
We will continue to execute on initiatives to help drive growth and fund investments, namely, launching new products across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies, leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow and capitalizing on our scale through the establishment of shared service centers. 
In all, leveraging these growth opportunities and executing on our internal actions will help mitigate mixed markets, drive productivity and redirect resources to pursue growth initiatives. We also expect to fully leverage the recovery in our oil and gas markets when it comes.

Steve, I think, in my script, I commented on our sequential decline in our first quarter of 12% and that we are anticipating another sequential decline in the second quarter of about 10%. If you look at the second half, the second half revenue is closely aligned with what we view as the run rate for the second quarter. And I would add one color comment on that. In the second half, we do have about $45 million of share gain revenue, sort of split evenly between the third and fourth quarter, on wins that we've won and we have line of sight to. Absent the share gain wins, the revenue in the second half would be modestly below the second quarter run rate.

Or was there any stuff that hit more in 1Q that's going to ease through the year? Or should we -- or is this kind of a good all-in, one run rate if we just adjust for the restructuring?"

But you do get the normal amortization of the goodwill and the -- actually the intangibles. So the inventory piece, I would say first quarter has been impacted by roughly $6 million or $7 million of inventory, and that doesn't repeat itself into the second or third, fourth quarters. And then, if you think about margins as well on restructuring, we said restructuring's going to be $40 million. If you think about how that's going to get spent, we had $14 million or so in the first quarter. I would expect, by the time we finish the second quarter, we'll be about $35 million or so of that $40 million spent."

And what we have tried to protect very diligently, and I commented on this in the script as well, is our engineering capability and our ability to respond pretty quickly. So when I say that we can take advantage of the recovery and leverage the recovery well when it does come, part of it's around our response capability.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our second quarter results, excluding deal costs and onetime items, were generally in line with our expectations, but disappointing nonetheless. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. 
Within the quarter, our June revenue, earnings and bookings were significantly improved from April's results. We expect to see this positive momentum carry into the third quarter and gives us confidence for an improved back half of the year. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. activity remains solid and grew organically low-single digits year-over-year. Our European markets were down sequentially and year-over-year on an organic basis. China improved sequentially but remained down from the prior year. We continue to be challenged by weak energy market dynamics though we believe the second quarter will mark the low point of our 2016 performance in our Energy segment. Our markets improved off a low April as North America rig count modestly increased and the price of oil remained in the mid- to high-40s. 
While the recent trend is encouraging, year-over-year rig count and customer CapEx were still down substantially. These factors drove our second quarter revenue down about 9% sequentially. This result was slightly better than expected as we continue to see the positive impact of our share gain initiatives. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 2% as the Printing & Identification platform had a very strong quarter posting organic growth of 9%. These outstanding results were seen both by our marking and coding and digital textile equipment businesses. 
In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%. This result was primarily driven by environmental solutions due to some deferred activity and tough comps against a very strong second quarter of 2015. 
Fluids posted 16% revenue growth, driven by several recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, revenue declined 8%. Our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers posted declines greater than we anticipated. Our businesses serving the hygienic and food and pharma markets continue to show growth. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 1% organically, principally driven by increased volume in display and specialty cases with several retail refrigeration customers. In all, retail refrigeration grew 4% organically in the quarter. 
Our food equipment markets were mixed, where very weak results in our food processing business in Europe offset growth in other food equipment end markets. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 3 deals this year, including Tokheim, and have signed an agreement to acquire Wayne, which we are very excited about. Our teams have been fully engaged planning the integration of Wayne and Tokheim, and the remark -- the market response to the announcement has been positive. We anticipate the transaction will close around the end of the third quarter.  When Wayne closes, we will have a $1.4 billion presence in the fuel, distribution and retail fueling market and be able to provide a unique product and service offering to our global customers. This deal, along with others, furthers our strategy to position Dover with a stronger long-term growth profile. 
Now looking forward. Within Energy, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance. We see modest sequential improvement assuming current oil prices and the North America rig count stay constructive. Initially, we expect our artificial lift business will benefit from increased MRO [ph] activity at the well site. We also believe an increased completion rate for drilled but uncompleted wells will continue, especially in lower-cost basins like the Permian. In all, we expect second half revenue to be about 2% higher than first half revenue. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged. We expect the marking and coding business to grow mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect revenue in the second half to be similar to the first half. 
Fluids decline in organic revenue will be more than offset by growth from acquisitions. In our current forecast, we have lowered the high end of our organic revenue as a result of continued soft markets. We have also reduced our growth rate for Tokheim as China activity and volume in other emerging markets is expected to remain weak in the back half of the year. We expect the solid growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we are trimming the high end of our full year forecast for organic revenue growth. While our retail refrigeration business remains solid, driven by our leading technology and merchandising solutions, we anticipate can-shaping [ph] orders and shipments to push out over year-end. We have a strong backlog within retail refrigeration and I'm pleased we have made good progress in our productivity and efficiency initiatives. 
In summary, I feel confident that our Energy segment will show modest improvement in the back half of the year. We expect our U.S. industrial markets to remain positive, and for Europe and China to modestly improve. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce a few additional deals before year-end. 
With respect to guidance, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance to $3.35 to $3.45, principally reflecting the impact of our full -- of our reduced full year revenue forecast and for deal costs and onetime items. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.76, including $0.04 of restructuring costs, deal costs of $0.02 and $0.04 of onetime items. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.1%, 250 basis points below last year. Approximately half of the margin reduction was due to higher year-over-year restructuring deal costs and onetime items. Bookings decreased 2% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% each. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.01.
Our backlog decreased 6% to $1.1 billion, and was down 1% when excluding dispositions. Of note, backlog increased 2% sequentially, largely reflecting retail refrigeration activity. 
Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter or 10% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion to net income benefited from actions to reduce working capital. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems increased organic revenue 2% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%. These increases reflect solid growth in Printing & Identification and in retail refrigeration.  Fluids organic decline of 8% was largely driven by oil and gas exposure. Energy organic decline was 28%, driven by weak North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 24% growth. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $259 million decreased 29%. Earnings were impacted by restructuring costs of $6 million, as well as other onetime costs of $5 million from our decision to temporarily suspend production at several plants, and $2 million in settlement costs. Adjusting for these items, earnings were $13 million and margin was 5% in the quarter. This margin performance largely reflects significant volume declines and price reductions of approximately 2%. We expect $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, $3 million higher than our prior forecast for this segment. We continue to believe we can exit the year with margin near 10%. 
Bookings were $246 million, and book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $592 million was flat overall and included organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings of $104 million increased 8%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity, volume leverage and a favorable product mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $264 million increased 15%. Organic revenue was up 9%, primarily reflecting strong global marking and coding and digital printing equipment activity. Acquisitions added 8% growth, while FX was 2% negative. 
In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 10% to $329 million, comprised of an organic decline of 2% and a 7% impact from dispositions. The organic revenue decline primarily reflected activity deferrals and tough comps in our environmental solutions business. Margin was 17.6%, 130 basis point improvement. Bookings of $571 million were up 2%, which included organic bookings growth of 4%. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings increased 14%, and industrial bookings decreased 2%. 
Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01. Industrial's book-to-bill of 0.93 reflects deferred order activity within environmental solutions. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.96. 
Now moving to Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 16% -- increased 16% to $406 million while earnings decreased 23% to $54 million. Revenue performance reflects 24% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by an 8% decline in organic revenue. The organic decline was driven by our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, lower spending in certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling and project timing. This decline was partially offset by continued solid results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Regarding acquisition growth, our retail fueling activity in China was weak, as were other emerging markets. Margin declined 670 basis points in the quarter, reflecting lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions, $4 million in deal costs and $3 million in incremental restructuring costs. Excluding acquisitions, related deal costs and restructuring, margin was 19.4%, a decrease of 80 basis points over an adjusted prior year. 
Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 24%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 1%. 
Book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $429 million was down 4% overall and included organic revenue growth of 1%. Earnings of $63 million declined 4% from the prior year. Earnings were flat with last year after adjusting for our recent disposition. Organic revenue growth was largely driven by increased volume with several retail refrigeration customers, especially in the display and specialty case product lines. 
Within food equipment, results were mixed. Solid results in commercial food service and can shaping equipment were offset by weak European food processing equipment results. Margin was 14.7%, unchanged from last year. Bookings were $469 million, down 4%. This result includes 4% organic growth, offset by dispositions and FX. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong retail refrigeration bookings. Book-to-bill was a seasonally strong 1.09. Of note, book-to-bill for retail refrigeration was 1.13 as compared to 1.06 last year. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, and net interest expense was $32 million, both largely in line with our expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding discrete tax costs, slightly lower than our prior forecasted rate. CapEx was $35 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. 
As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted on the high end to reflect reduced forecasts for Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. We now expect total revenue to decrease 3% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 8% as compared to our prior forecast of down 5% to 8%. We expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%, excluding restructuring and deal costs and onetime items. Corporate expense is now anticipated to be $108 million for the year, $12 million below our prior forecast on reduced spending.  Our full year forecast for interest expense is unchanged, and the pre-discrete tax rate has been slightly lowered to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
From a segment perspective, Energy and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast are unchanged from our prior guidance. Fluids organic revenue has been reduced 2 points on the high end and now is forecasted to decline 4% to 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 1 point at the high end and now stands at 2% to 3%. The impact of acquisitions, dispositions and FX remains unchanged. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We continue to expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.07. Performance, including volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.37 to $0.31. This has reduced $0.20 from our prior forecast and now includes $0.05 of deal costs and $0.04 of onetime costs. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.20 to $0.17, reflecting roughly $0.02 lower spend from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions will be about $0.12 accretive in total, $0.04 lower than our prior forecast, primarily driven by slower activity in China retail fueling markets and other emerging markets. The combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.06 better than our prior forecast, driven by reduced corporate expense and a slightly lower tax rate. Lastly, discrete tax benefits of $0.04 are included in our forecast. 
In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.35 to $3.45, down about $0.19 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.09 of this reduction is attributable to deal costs and onetime costs, and the remainder is driven by lower revenue forecast in Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, offset, in part by lower corporate expense and a reduced tax rate. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Bob for some final comments."

Let me share some summary comments as we move into the back half of our year. 
We saw strong organic bookings growth in Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, which sets them up well for their second half revenue plan.  In Energy, we expect improved sequential performance, driven by modestly improving markets, share gain initiatives and a reduced cost base. We also see a renewed focus on land-based drilling and production, especially in lower-cost basins. 
Within Fluids, second half revenues will be up to seasonality in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our pharma and hygienic applications. We are excited about our growth and margin expansion opportunities in the retail fueling market, especially with the addition of Wayne. 
I am pleased with the many positive changes we've made to our business profile over the last few years. We now have several large businesses with global scale, and you should expect us to continue this strategy of creating great businesses across our growth markets. 
In all, I believe we'll demonstrate much stronger performance in the second half. We remain focused on improving our financial performance and increasing shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Now Paul, let's take some questions."

It includes deal costs in the second and third quarter in our Fluids business, which we highlighted. That's all related to Wayne. What we don't have in our forecast is any contingent upon completion costs, which will come at the time we complete the deal. If we complete the deal at the end of the third quarter here going into the fourth quarter, we feel pretty confident with the numbers that we had previously stated about the amount of sales that they expect for 2016, annual -- we said 5 50. I think they're actually right on that number to -- doing quite well, quite frankly. So without giving a lot of details around seasonality, if you took 1/4 of that number and then you looked at deal costs and amortization step ups and the like, our view is it will be in the fourth quarter, incremental to the forecast we just gave you, dilutive because of again, finalization of deal costs, amortization, step ups in the P&L, positive operationally. But after those cost, dilutive. And of course, you would have the funding cost or the interest cost associated with the purchase price of $780 million.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our second quarter results, excluding deal costs and onetime items, were generally in line with our expectations, but disappointing nonetheless. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. 
Within the quarter, our June revenue, earnings and bookings were significantly improved from April's results. We expect to see this positive momentum carry into the third quarter and gives us confidence for an improved back half of the year. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. activity remains solid and grew organically low-single digits year-over-year. Our European markets were down sequentially and year-over-year on an organic basis. China improved sequentially but remained down from the prior year. We continue to be challenged by weak energy market dynamics though we believe the second quarter will mark the low point of our 2016 performance in our Energy segment. Our markets improved off a low April as North America rig count modestly increased and the price of oil remained in the mid- to high-40s. 
While the recent trend is encouraging, year-over-year rig count and customer CapEx were still down substantially. These factors drove our second quarter revenue down about 9% sequentially. This result was slightly better than expected as we continue to see the positive impact of our share gain initiatives. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 2% as the Printing & Identification platform had a very strong quarter posting organic growth of 9%. These outstanding results were seen both by our marking and coding and digital textile equipment businesses. 
In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%. This result was primarily driven by environmental solutions due to some deferred activity and tough comps against a very strong second quarter of 2015. 
Fluids posted 16% revenue growth, driven by several recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, revenue declined 8%. Our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers posted declines greater than we anticipated. Our businesses serving the hygienic and food and pharma markets continue to show growth. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 1% organically, principally driven by increased volume in display and specialty cases with several retail refrigeration customers. In all, retail refrigeration grew 4% organically in the quarter. 
Our food equipment markets were mixed, where very weak results in our food processing business in Europe offset growth in other food equipment end markets. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 3 deals this year, including Tokheim, and have signed an agreement to acquire Wayne, which we are very excited about. Our teams have been fully engaged planning the integration of Wayne and Tokheim, and the remark -- the market response to the announcement has been positive. We anticipate the transaction will close around the end of the third quarter.  When Wayne closes, we will have a $1.4 billion presence in the fuel, distribution and retail fueling market and be able to provide a unique product and service offering to our global customers. This deal, along with others, furthers our strategy to position Dover with a stronger long-term growth profile. 
Now looking forward. Within Energy, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance. We see modest sequential improvement assuming current oil prices and the North America rig count stay constructive. Initially, we expect our artificial lift business will benefit from increased MRO activity at the well site. We also believe an increased completion rate for drilled but uncompleted wells will continue, especially in lower-cost basins like the Permian. In all, we expect second half revenue to be about 2% higher than first half revenue. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged. We expect the marking and coding business to grow mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect revenue in the second half to be similar to the first half. 
Fluids decline in organic revenue will be more than offset by growth from acquisitions. In our current forecast, we have lowered the high end of our organic revenue as a result of continued soft markets. We have also reduced our growth rate for Tokheim as China activity and volume in other emerging markets is expected to remain weak in the back half of the year. We expect the solid growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we are trimming the high end of our full year forecast for organic revenue growth. While our retail refrigeration business remains solid, driven by our leading technology and merchandising solutions, we anticipate can shaping orders and shipments to push out over year-end. We have a strong backlog within retail refrigeration and I'm pleased we have made good progress in our productivity and efficiency initiatives. 
In summary, I feel confident that our Energy segment will show modest improvement in the back half of the year. We expect our U.S. industrial markets to remain positive, and for Europe and China to modestly improve. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce a few additional deals before year-end. 
With respect to guidance, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance to $3.35 to $3.45, principally reflecting the impact of our full -- of our reduced full year revenue forecast and for deal costs and onetime items. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispo",1412,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.76, including $0.04 of restructuring costs, deal costs of $0.02 and $0.04 of onetime items. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.1%, 250 basis points below last year. Approximately half of the margin reduction was due to higher year-over-year restructuring deal costs and onetime items. Bookings decreased 2% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% each. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.01.
Our backlog decreased 6% to $1.1 billion, and was down 1% when excluding dispositions. Of note, backlog increased 2% sequentially, largely reflecting retail refrigeration activity. 
Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter or 10% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion to net income benefited from actions to reduce working capital. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems increased organic revenue 2% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%. These increases reflect solid growth in Printing & Identification and in retail refrigeration.  Fluids organic decline of 8% was largely driven by oil and gas exposure. Energy organic decline was 28%, driven by weak North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 24% growth. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $259 million decreased 29%. Earnings were impacted by restructuring costs of $6 million, as well as other onetime costs of $5 million from our decision to temporarily suspend production at several plants, and $2 million in settlement costs. Adjusting for these items, earnings were $13 million and margin was 5% in the quarter. This margin performance largely reflects significant volume declines and price reductions of approximately 2%. We expect $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, $3 million higher than our prior forecast for this segment. We continue to believe we can exit the year with margin near 10%. 
Bookings were $246 million, and book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $592 million was flat overall and included organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings of $104 million increased 8%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity, volume leverage and a favorable product mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $264 million increased 15%. Organic revenue was up 9%, primarily reflecting strong global marking and coding and digital printing equipment activity. Acquisitions added 8% growth, while FX was 2% negative. 
In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 10% to $329 million, comprised of an organic decline of 2% and a 7% impact from dispositions. The organic revenue decline primarily reflected activity deferrals and tough comps in our environmental solutions business. Margin was 17.6%, 130 basis point improvement. Bookings of $571 million were up 2%, which included organic bookings growth of 4%. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings increased 14%, and industrial bookings decreased 2%. 
Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01. Industrial's book-to-bill of 0.93 reflects deferred order activity within environmental solutions. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.96. 
Now moving to Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 16% -- increased 16% to $406 million while earnings decreased 23% to $54 million. Revenue performance reflects 24% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by an 8% decline in organic revenue. The organic decline was driven by our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, lower spending in certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling and project timing. This decline was partially offset by continued solid results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Regarding acquisition growth, our retail fueling activity in China was weak, as were other emerging markets. Margin declined 670 basis points in the quarter, reflecting lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions, $4 million in deal costs and $3 million in incremental restructuring costs. Excluding acquisitions, related deal costs and restructuring, margin was 19.4%, a decrease of 80 basis points over an adjusted prior year. 
Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 24%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 1%. 
Book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $429 million was down 4% overall and included organic revenue growth of 1%. Earnings of $63 million declined 4% from the prior year. Earnings were flat with last year after adjusting for our recent disposition. Organic revenue growth was largely driven by increased volume with several retail refrigeration customers, especially in the display and specialty case product lines. 
Within food equipment, results were mixed. Solid results in commercial food service and can shaping equipment were offset by weak European food processing equipment results. Margin was 14.7%, unchanged from last year. Bookings were $469 million, down 4%. This result includes 4% organic growth, offset by dispositions and FX. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong retail refrigeration bookings. Book-to-bill was a seasonally strong 1.09. Of note, book-to-bill for retail refrigeration was 1.13 as compared to 1.06 last year. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, and net interest expense was $32 million, both largely in line with our expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding discrete tax costs, slightly lower than our prior forecasted rate. CapEx was $35 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. 
As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted on the high end to reflect reduced forecasts for Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. We now expect total revenue to decrease 3% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 8% as compared to our prior forecast of down 5% to 8%. We expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%, excluding restructuring and deal costs and onetime items. Corporate expense is now anticipated to be $108 million for the year, $12 million below our prior forecast on reduced spending.  Our full year forecast for interest expense is unchanged, and the pre-discrete tax rate has been slightly lowered to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
From a segment perspective, Energy and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast are unchanged from our prior guidance. Fluids organic revenue has been reduced 2 points on the high end and now is forecasted to decline 4% to 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 1 point at the high end and now stands at 2% to 3%. The impact of acquisitions, dispositions and FX remains unchanged. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We continue to expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.07. Performance, including volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.37 to $0.31. This has reduced $0.20 from our prior forecast and now includes $0.05 of deal costs and $0.04 of onetime costs. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.20 to $0.17, reflecting roughly $0.02 lower spend from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions will be about $0.12 accretive in total, $0.04 lower than our prior forecast, primarily driven by slower activity in China retail fueling markets and other emerging markets. The combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.06 better than our prior forecast, driven by reduced corporate expense and a slightly lower tax rate. Lastly, discrete tax benefits of $0.04 are included in our forecast. 
In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.35 to $3.45, down about $0.19 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.09 of this reduction is attributable to deal costs and onetime costs, and the remainder is driven by lower revenue forecast in Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, offset, in part by lower corporate expense and a reduced tax rate. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Bob for some final comments."

Let me share some summary comments as we move into the back half of our year. 
We saw strong organic bookings growth in Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, which sets them up well for their second half revenue plan.  In Energy, we expect improved sequential performance, driven by modestly improving markets, share gain initiatives and a reduced cost base. We also see a renewed focus on land-based drilling and production, especially in lower-cost basins. 
Within Fluids, second half revenues will be up to seasonality in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our pharma and hygienic applications. We are excited about our growth and margin expansion opportunities in the retail fueling market, especially with the addition of Wayne. 
I am pleased with the many positive changes we've made to our business profile over the last few years. We now have several large businesses with global scale, and you should expect us to continue this strategy of creating great businesses across our growth markets. 
In all, I believe we'll demonstrate much stronger performance in the second half. We remain focused on improving our financial performance and increasing shareholder value.

Our upstream order activity and Energy in June was up 18% over April. And our expectation for the third quarter and Energy order rates here in the first 2, 3 weeks of July were actually running slightly ahead of our third quarter forecast, especially in what we would label as the early cycle business activity around our rods and our ESP pumps. But we see the turn, and we feel fairly confident with our forecast for the second half of the year.

What we don't have in our forecast is any -- contingent upon completion costs which will come at the time we complete the deal.

I think they're actually right on that number to doing quite well, quite frankly. So without giving a lot of details around seasonality, if you took 1/4 of that number and then you looked at deal costs and amortization step ups and the like, our view is it will be in the fourth quarter, incremental to the forecast we just gave you, dilutive, because of, again, finalization of deal costs, amortization, step ups hitting the P&L, positive operationally, but after those costs, dilutive.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our second quarter results, excluding deal cost and onetime items, were generally in line with our expectations, but disappointing nonetheless. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. Within the quarter, our June revenue, earnings and bookings were significantly improved from April's results. We expect to see this positive momentum carry into the third quarter and gives us confidence for an improved back half of the year. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. activity remains solid and grew organically low-single digits year-over-year. Our European markets were down sequentially and year-over-year on an organic basis. China improved sequentially, but remained down from the prior year. We continue to be challenged by weak energy market dynamics though we believe the second quarter will mark the low point of our 2016 performance in our Energy segment. Our markets improved off a low April as North America rig count modestly increased and the price of oil remained in the mid- to high-40s. 
While the recent trend is encouraging, year-over-year rig count and customer CapEx were still down substantially. These factors drove our second quarter revenue down about 9% sequentially. This result was slightly better than expected as we continued to see the positive impact of our share gain initiatives. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 2% as the Printing & Identification platform had a very strong quarter posting organic growth of 9%. These outstanding results were seen both by our marking and coding and digital textile equipment businesses. 
In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%. This result was primarily driven by environmental solutions due to some deferred activity and tough comps against a very strong second quarter of 2015. 
Fluids posted 16% revenue growth, driven by several recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, revenue declined 8%. Our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers posted declines greater than we anticipated. Our businesses serving the hygienic and food and pharma markets continue to show growth. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 1% organically, principally driven by increased volume in display and specialty cases with several retail refrigeration customers. In all, retail refrigeration grew 4% organically in the quarter. 
Our food equipment markets were mixed, where very weak results in our food processing business in Europe offset growth in other food equipment end markets. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 3 deals this year, including Tokheim, and have signed an agreement to acquire Wayne, which we are very excited about. Our teams have been fully engaged planning the integration of Wayne and Tokheim, and the remark -- the market response to the announcement has been positive. We anticipate the transaction will close around the end of the third quarter. When Wayne closes, we will have a $1.4 billion presence in the fuel, distribution and retail fueling market and be able to provide a unique product and service offering to our global customers. This deal, along with others, furthers our strategy to position Dover with a stronger long-term growth profile. 
Now, looking forward. Within Energy, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance. We see modest sequential improvement assuming current oil prices and the North America rig count stay constructive. Initially, we expect our artificial lift business will benefit from increased MRO activity at the well site. We also believe an increased completion rate for drilled-but-uncompleted wells will continue, especially in lower-cost basins like the Permian. In all, we expect second half revenue to be about 2% higher than first half revenue. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged. We expect the marking and coding business to grow mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect revenue in the second half to be similar to the first half. 
Fluids' decline in organic revenue will be more than offset by growth from acquisitions. In our current forecast, we have lowered the high end of our organic revenue as a result of continued soft markets. We have also reduced our growth rate for Tokheim as China activity and volume in other emerging markets is expected to remain weak in the back half of the year. We expect the solid growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we are trimming the high end of our full year forecast for organic revenue growth. While our retail refrigeration business remains solid, driven by our leading technology and merchandising solutions, we anticipate can shaping orders and shipments to push out over year-end. We have a strong backlog within retail refrigeration and I'm pleased we have made good progress in our productivity and efficiency initiatives. 
In summary, I feel confident that our Energy segment will show modest improvement in the back half of the year. We expect our U.S. industrial markets to remain positive, and for Europe and China to modestly improve. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce a few additional deals before year-end. 
With respect to guidance, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance to $3.35 to $3.45, principally reflecting the impact of our full -- of our reduced full year revenue forecast and for deal cost and onetime items. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispo",1413,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.76, including $0.04 of restructuring costs, deal costs of $0.02 and $0.04 of onetime items. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.1%, 250 basis points below last year. Approximately half of the margin reduction was due to higher year-over-year restructuring deal costs and onetime items. Bookings decreased 2% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% each. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.01.
Our backlog decreased 6% to $1.1 billion, and was down 1% when excluding dispositions. Of note, backlog increased 2% sequentially, largely reflecting retail refrigeration activity. 
Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter or 10% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion to net income benefited from actions to reduce working capital. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems increased organic revenue 2% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%. These increases reflect solid growth in Printing & Identification and in retail refrigeration. Fluids organic decline of 8% was largely driven by oil and gas exposure. Energy organic decline was 28%, driven by weak North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 24% growth. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $259 million decreased 29%. Earnings were impacted by restructuring costs of $6 million, as well as other onetime costs of $5 million from our decision to temporarily suspend production at several plants, and $2 million in settlement costs. Adjusting for these items, earnings were $13 million and margin was 5% in the quarter. This margin performance largely reflects significant volume declines and price reductions of approximately 2%. We expect $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, $3 million higher than our prior forecast for this segment. We continue to believe we can exit the year with margin near 10%. 
Bookings were $246 million, and book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems' revenue of $592 million was flat overall and included organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings of $104 million increased 8%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity, volume leverage and a favorable product mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $264 million increased 15%. Organic revenue was up 9%, primarily reflecting strong global marking and coding and digital printing equipment activity. Acquisitions added 8% growth, while FX was 2% negative. 
In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 10% to $329 million, comprised of an organic decline of 2% and a 7% impact from dispositions. The organic revenue decline primarily reflected activity deferrals and tough comps in our environmental solutions business. Margin was 17.6%, a 130 basis point improvement. Bookings of $571 million were up 2%, which included organic bookings growth of 4%. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings increased 14%, and industrial bookings decreased 2%. 
Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01. Industrial's book-to-bill of 0.93 reflects deferred order activity within environmental solutions. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.96. 
Now moving to Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 16% -- increased 16% to $406 million while earnings decreased 23% to $54 million. Revenue performance reflects 24% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by an 8% decline in organic revenue. The organic decline was driven by our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, lower spending in certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling and project timing. This decline was partially offset by continued solid results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Regarding acquisition growth, our retail fueling activity in China was weak, as were other emerging markets. Margin declined 670 basis points in the quarter, reflecting lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions, $4 million in deal costs and $3 million in incremental restructuring costs. Excluding acquisitions, related deal costs and restructuring, margin was 19.4%, a decrease of 80 basis points over an adjusted prior year. 
Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 24%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 1%. 
Book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $429 million was down 4% overall and included organic revenue growth of 1%. Earnings of $63 million declined 4% from the prior year. Earnings were flat with last year after adjusting for our recent disposition. Organic revenue growth was largely driven by increased volume with several retail refrigeration customers, especially in the display and specialty case product lines. 
Within food equipment, results were mixed. Solid results in commercial food service and can shaping equipment were offset by weak European food processing equipment results. Margin was 14.7%, unchanged from last year. 
Bookings were $469 million, down 4%. This result includes 4% organic growth, offset by dispositions and FX. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong retail refrigeration bookings. Book-to-bill was a seasonally strong 1.09. Of note, book-to-bill for retail refrigeration was 1.13 as compared to 1.06 last year. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, and net interest expense was $32 million, both largely in line with our expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding discrete tax costs, slightly lower than our prior forecasted rate. CapEx was $35 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted on the high end to reflect reduced forecasts for Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. We now expect total revenue to decrease 3% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 8% as compared to our prior forecast of down 5% to 8%. We expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%, excluding restructuring and deal costs and onetime items. Corporate expense is now anticipated to be $108 million for the year, $12 million below our prior forecast on reduced spending. Our full year forecast for interest expense is unchanged, and the pre-discrete tax rate has been slightly lowered to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
From a segment perspective, Energy and Engineered Systems' full year organic revenue forecasts are unchanged from our prior guidance. Fluids' organic revenue has been reduced 2 points on the high end and now is forecasted to decline 4% to 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 1 point at the high end and now stands at 2% to 3%. The impact of acquisitions, dispositions and FX remains unchanged. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We continue to expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.07. Performance, including volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.37 to $0.31. This has reduced $0.20 from our prior forecast and now includes $0.05 of deal costs and $0.04 of onetime costs. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.20 to $0.17, reflecting roughly $0.02 lower spend from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions will be about $0.12 accretive in total, $0.04 lower than our prior forecast, primarily driven by slower activity in China retail fueling markets and other emerging markets. The combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.06 better than our prior forecast, driven by reduced corporate expense and a slightly lower tax rate. Lastly, discrete tax benefits of $0.04 are included in our forecast. 
In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.35 to $3.45, down about $0.19 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.09 of this reduction is attributable to deal costs and onetime costs, and the remainder is driven by lower revenue forecast in Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, offset, in part by lower corporate expense and a reduced tax rate. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Bob for some final comments."

Let me share some summary comments as we move into the back half of our year. 
We saw strong organic bookings growth in Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, which sets them up well for their second half revenue plan. In Energy, we expect improved sequential performance, driven by modestly improving markets, share gain initiatives and a reduced cost base. We also see a renewed focus on land-based drilling and production, especially in lower-cost basins. 
Within Fluids, second half revenues will be up to seasonality in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our pharma and hygienic applications. We are excited about our growth and margin expansion opportunities in the retail fueling market, especially with the addition of Wayne. 
I am pleased with the many positive changes we've made to our business profile over the last few years. We now have several large businesses with global scale, and you should expect us to continue this strategy of creating great businesses across our growth markets. 
In all, I believe we'll demonstrate much stronger performance in the second half. We remain focused on improving our financial performance and increasing shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers.

But let me just start by saying that when we talked about -- let me just clarify the P&L that we have, the forecast that we currently give you here in this update. It includes deal costs in the second and third quarter in our Fluids business, which we highlighted. That's all related to Wayne. What we don't have in our forecast is any contingent-upon-completion costs which will come at the time we complete the deal. If we complete the deal at the end of the third quarter here, going into the fourth quarter, we feel pretty confident with the numbers that we had previously stated about the amount of sales that they expect for 2016 annual -- we said $550 million. I think they're actually right on that number to doing quite well, quite frankly. So without giving a lot of details around seasonality, if you took 1/4 of that number and then you looked at deal costs and amortization step-ups and the like, our view is it will be in the fourth quarter, incremental to the forecast we just gave you, dilutive, because of, again, finalization of deal costs, amortization, step-ups hitting the P&L; positive operationally, but after those costs, dilutive. And then of course, you would have the funding cost or the interest cost associated with the purchase price of $780 million that would also hit the P&L in the fourth quarter."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our second quarter results, excluding deal cost and onetime items, were generally in line with our expectations, but disappointing nonetheless. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. Within the quarter, our June revenue, earnings and bookings were significantly improved from April's results. We expect to see this positive momentum carry into the third quarter and gives us confidence for an improved back half of the year. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. activity remains solid and grew organically low-single digits year-over-year. Our European markets were down sequentially and year-over-year on an organic basis. China improved sequentially, but remained down from the prior year. We continue to be challenged by weak energy market dynamics though we believe the second quarter will mark the low point of our 2016 performance in our Energy segment. Our markets improved off a low April as North America rig count modestly increased and the price of oil remained in the mid- to high-40s. 
While the recent trend is encouraging, year-over-year rig count and customer CapEx were still down substantially. These factors drove our second quarter revenue down about 9% sequentially. This result was slightly better than expected as we continued to see the positive impact of our share gain initiatives. 
Engineered Systems organic growth was 2% as the Printing & Identification platform had a very strong quarter posting organic growth of 9%. These outstanding results were seen both by our marking and coding and digital textile equipment businesses. 
In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%. This result was primarily driven by environmental solutions due to some deferred activity and tough comps against a very strong second quarter of 2015. 
Fluids posted 16% revenue growth, driven by several recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, revenue declined 8%. Our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated Energy customers posted declines greater than we anticipated. Our businesses serving the hygienic and food and pharma markets continue to show growth. 
Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 1% organically, principally driven by increased volume in display and specialty cases with several retail refrigeration customers. In all, retail refrigeration grew 4% organically in the quarter. 
Our food equipment markets were mixed, where very weak results in our food processing business in Europe offset growth in other food equipment end markets. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 3 deals this year, including Tokheim, and have signed an agreement to acquire Wayne, which we are very excited about. Our teams have been fully engaged planning the integration of Wayne and Tokheim, and the remark -- the market response to the announcement has been positive. We anticipate the transaction will close around the end of the third quarter. When Wayne closes, we will have a $1.4 billion presence in the fuel, distribution and retail fueling market and be able to provide a unique product and service offering to our global customers. This deal, along with others, furthers our strategy to position Dover with a stronger long-term growth profile. 
Now looking forward. Within Energy, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance. We see modest sequential improvement assuming current oil prices and the North America rig count stay constructive. Initially, we expect our artificial lift business will benefit from increased MRO activity at the well site. We also believe an increased completion rate for drilled but uncompleted wells will continue, especially in lower-cost basins like the Permian. In all, we expect second half revenue to be about 2% higher than first half revenue. 
In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged. We expect the marking and coding business to grow mid-single digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect revenue in the second half to be similar to the first half. 
Fluids' decline in organic revenue will be more than offset by growth from acquisitions. In our current forecast, we have lowered the high end of our organic revenue as a result of continued soft markets. We have also reduced our growth rate for Tokheim as China activity and volume in other emerging markets is expected to remain weak in the back half of the year. We expect the solid growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we are trimming the high end of our full year forecast for organic revenue growth. While our retail refrigeration business remains solid, driven by our leading technology and merchandising solutions, we anticipate can shaping orders and shipments to push out over year-end. We have a strong backlog within retail refrigeration and I'm pleased we have made good progress in our productivity and efficiency initiatives. 
In summary, I feel confident that our Energy segment will show modest improvement in the back half of the year. We expect our U.S. industrial markets to remain positive, and for Europe and China to modestly improve. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce a few additional deals before year-end. 
With respect to guidance, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance to $3.35 to $3.45, principally reflecting the impact of our full -- of our reduced full year revenue forecast and for deal cost and onetime items. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispo",1413,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.76, including $0.04 of restructuring costs, deal costs of $0.02 and $0.04 of onetime items. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.1%, 250 basis points below last year. Approximately half of the margin reduction was due to higher year-over-year restructuring deal costs and onetime items. Bookings decreased 2% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% each. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.01.
Our backlog decreased 6% to $1.1 billion, and was down 1% when excluding dispositions. Of note, backlog increased 2% sequentially, largely reflecting retail refrigeration activity. 
Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter or 10% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion to net income benefited from actions to reduce working capital. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Engineered Systems increased organic revenue 2% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%. These increases reflect solid growth in Printing & Identification and in retail refrigeration. Fluids organic decline of 8% was largely driven by oil and gas exposure. Energy organic decline was 28%, driven by weak North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 24% growth. 
Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $259 million decreased 29%. Earnings were impacted by restructuring costs of $6 million, as well as other onetime costs of $5 million from our decision to temporarily suspend production at several plants, and $2 million in settlement costs. Adjusting for these items, earnings were $13 million and margin was 5% in the quarter. This margin performance largely reflects significant volume declines and price reductions of approximately 2%. We expect $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, $3 million higher than our prior forecast for this segment. We continue to believe we can exit the year with margin near 10%. 
Bookings were $246 million, and book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Turning to Slide 6. Engineered Systems' revenue of $592 million was flat overall and included organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings of $104 million increased 8%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity, volume leverage and a favorable product mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $264 million increased 15%. Organic revenue was up 9%, primarily reflecting strong global marking and coding and digital printing equipment activity. Acquisitions added 8% growth, while FX was 2% negative. 
In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 10% to $329 million, comprised of an organic decline of 2% and a 7% impact from dispositions. The organic revenue decline primarily reflected activity deferrals and tough comps in our environmental solutions business. Margin was 17.6%, a 130 basis point improvement. Bookings of $571 million were up 2%, which included organic bookings growth of 4%. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings increased 14%, and industrial bookings decreased 2%. 
Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01. Industrial's book-to-bill of 0.93 reflects deferred order activity within environmental solutions. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.96. 
Now moving to Slide 7. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 16% -- increased 16% to $406 million while earnings decreased 23% to $54 million. Revenue performance reflects 24% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by an 8% decline in organic revenue. The organic decline was driven by our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, lower spending in certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling and project timing. This decline was partially offset by continued solid results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Regarding acquisition growth, our retail fueling activity in China was weak, as were other emerging markets. Margin declined 670 basis points in the quarter, reflecting lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions, $4 million in deal costs and $3 million in incremental restructuring costs. Excluding acquisitions, related deal costs and restructuring, margin was 19.4%, a decrease of 80 basis points over an adjusted prior year. 
Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 24%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 1%. 
Book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $429 million was down 4% overall and included organic revenue growth of 1%. Earnings of $63 million declined 4% from the prior year. Earnings were flat with last year after adjusting for our recent disposition. Organic revenue growth was largely driven by increased volume with several retail refrigeration customers, especially in the display and specialty case product lines. 
Within food equipment, results were mixed. Solid results in commercial food service and can shaping equipment were offset by weak European food processing equipment results. Margin was 14.7%, unchanged from last year. 
Bookings were $469 million, down 4%. This result includes 4% organic growth, offset by dispositions and FX. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong retail refrigeration bookings. Book-to-bill was a seasonally strong 1.09. Of note, book-to-bill for retail refrigeration was 1.13 as compared to 1.06 last year. 
Going to the overview on Slide 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million, and net interest expense was $32 million, both largely in line with our expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding discrete tax costs, slightly lower than our prior forecasted rate. CapEx was $35 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted on the high end to reflect reduced forecasts for Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. We now expect total revenue to decrease 3% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 8% as compared to our prior forecast of down 5% to 8%. We expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%, excluding restructuring and deal costs and onetime items. Corporate expense is now anticipated to be $108 million for the year, $12 million below our prior forecast on reduced spending. Our full year forecast for interest expense is unchanged, and the pre-discrete tax rate has been slightly lowered to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
From a segment perspective, Energy and Engineered Systems' full year organic revenue forecasts are unchanged from our prior guidance. Fluids' organic revenue has been reduced 2 points on the high end and now is forecasted to decline 4% to 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 1 point at the high end and now stands at 2% to 3%. The impact of acquisitions, dispositions and FX remains unchanged. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We continue to expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.07. Performance, including volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits, will impact earnings $0.37 to $0.31. This has reduced $0.20 from our prior forecast and now includes $0.05 of deal costs and $0.04 of onetime costs. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.20 to $0.17, reflecting roughly $0.02 lower spend from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions will be about $0.12 accretive in total, $0.04 lower than our prior forecast, primarily driven by slower activity in China retail fueling markets and other emerging markets. The combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.06 better than our prior forecast, driven by reduced corporate expense and a slightly lower tax rate. Lastly, discrete tax benefits of $0.04 are included in our forecast. 
In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.35 to $3.45, down about $0.19 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.09 of this reduction is attributable to deal costs and onetime costs, and the remainder is driven by lower revenue forecast in Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, offset, in part by lower corporate expense and a reduced tax rate. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Bob for some final comments."

Let me share some summary comments as we move into the back half of our year. 
We saw strong organic bookings growth in Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, which sets them up well for their second half revenue plan. In Energy, we expect improved sequential performance, driven by modestly improving markets, share gain initiatives and a reduced cost base. We also see a renewed focus on land-based drilling and production, especially in lower-cost basins. 
Within Fluids, second half revenues will be up to seasonality in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our pharma and hygienic applications. We are excited about our growth and margin expansion opportunities in the retail fueling market, especially with the addition of Wayne. 
I am pleased with the many positive changes we've made to our business profile over the last few years. We now have several large businesses with global scale, and you should expect us to continue this strategy of creating great businesses across our growth markets. 
In all, I believe we'll demonstrate much stronger performance in the second half. We remain focused on improving our financial performance and increasing shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers.

But let me just start by saying that when we talked about -- let me just clarify the P&L that we have, the forecast that we currently give you here in this update. It includes deal costs in the second and third quarter in our Fluids business, which we highlighted. That's all related to Wayne. What we don't have in our forecast is any contingent upon completion costs which will come at the time we complete the deal. If we complete the deal at the end of the third quarter here, going into the fourth quarter, we feel pretty confident with the numbers that we had previously stated about the amount of sales that they expect for 2016 annual -- we said $550 million. I think they're actually right on that number to doing quite well, quite frankly. So without giving a lot of details around seasonality, if you took 1/4 of that number and then you looked at deal costs and amortization step-ups and the like, our view is it will be in the fourth quarter, incremental to the forecast we just gave you, dilutive, because of, again, finalization of deal costs, amortization, step-ups hitting the P&L; positive operationally, but after those costs, dilutive. And then of course, you would have the funding cost or the interest cost associated with the purchase price of $780 million that would also hit the P&L in the fourth quarter."

These results were well below our expectations and more than offset solid improvements in our upstream drilling and production businesses, as well as continued strong performance in our Printing & Identification platform. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. and China activity declined organically, both sequentially and year-over-year. On an organic basis, our European markets improved sequentially and year-over-year. 
Within Energy, revenue was up 5% sequentially, largely within our drilling and production markets. This improvement was driven by increases in the North American rig count, principally in the Permian. The recent trends in rig count and oil price are constructive and supportive of continued near-term improvement in our early cycle businesses.  That said, within this segment, we continue to be challenged in longer cycle applications. 
Engineered Systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in Printing & Identification, which posted organic growth of 5%. In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%, though our vehicle service equipment business had a very strong quarter. 
Fluids posted 17% revenue growth, driven by acquisitions. However, our organic revenue decline of 9% reflects activity reductions in our businesses with longer-cycle oil and gas exposure, as well as tough comps. 
Lastly, growth in retail fueling was less than anticipated while our businesses serving the hygienic and pharma markets continue to show very strong growth. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue declined 2% organically, principally driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment. Margin performance was well below expectations at Hill PHOENIX, primarily driven by production challenges in case manufacturing. We continue to implement changes to improve the business. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 2 deals since our last earnings call, both in Engineered Systems. We added a small automation and data analytics business and also acquired a European lift business. The addition of the lift business gives us a $500 million platform in the growing vehicle service equipment market. We also recently announced that the Wayne acquisition, due to an extended regulatory review in the U.K., will now likely close in the first quarter. Our teams are actively exploring measures to satisfy the regulator's concerns as quickly as possible. This matter relates only to the U.K. dispenser business, which is very small in the context of the transaction. 
Now looking forward. 
Within Energy, we are encouraged by the recent improvements in North American rig count and oil prices and believe both are constructive for continued near-term improvements in our business. That said, we anticipate our longer cycle oil and gas-related businesses to remain sequentially flat. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate activity in our industrial platform to remain soft due to a challenging macro industrial environment, as well as from activity deferrals as some customers pushed out order delivery into 2017. We expect our Printing & ID platform to have strong growth. 
Fluids' overall growth will be less than we expected in our prior forecast, driven by continued weak longer cycle oil and gas markets as well as CapEx reductions by integrated Energy customers. We expect the strong growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect customer spending to slow as we close out the year. We also expect margin challenges to continue as we work to improve manufacturing at Hill PHOENIX. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.83. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.1%, below last year, largely driven by lower revenue and the impact of acquisitions and production inefficiencies. 
Bookings decreased slightly from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. 
Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew 6%, while Energy was down 22% and Fluids decreased 9%. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Our backlog increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 1% organically. Free cash flow was $189 million for the quarter or 11% of revenue. We remain on track to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. 
Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1%, reflecting solid growth in Printing & Identification, partially offset by soft industrial markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 2%, driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment and softer customer spending in retail refrigeration. Food's organic decline of 9% was largely driven by upstream and midstream oil and gas exposure, tough comps and a lower-than-expected growth in retail fueling. Energy organic revenue was down 24%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 27%. 
Now on Slide 5. 
Energy revenue of $273 million decreased 25%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 5%, driven by our upstream drilling and artificial lift businesses. Earnings of $13 million included restructuring costs of $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, earnings were $18 million, and margin was 6.8%, in line with our expectations and sequentially improved. 
Current quarter activity -- order activity remains positive, but we believe we are on track to exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $271 million, a 10% sequential improvement. Book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Now on Slide 6. 
Engineered Systems revenue of $571 million was up 1% organically. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%, principally reflecting the impact of a disposition and also impacted by business mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $253 million increased 11%. Organic revenue was up 5%, reflecting solid global marking and coding and strong digital printing activity. Acquisitions added 7% growth. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was $317 million, which included an organic decline of 2%. The organic revenue decline was fairly broad-based and also reflected activity deferrals into the first quarter at Environmental Solutions. 
Margin was 17%, an 80 [ph] basis point decline. Bookings of $580 million were up 3%, which included organic growth of 5% in both platforms. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98. Industrial's book-to-bill was 1.04. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now on Slide 7. 
Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $413 million, while earnings decreased 12% to $66 million. Revenue performance reflects 27% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 9% decline in organic revenue. The organic result was driven by declines in our longer-cycle [ph] upstream and midstream oil and gas businesses and tough comps, reflecting $18 million in project shipments last year that did not repeat.  In addition, spending from certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling, was lower than anticipated. This decline was partially offset by very strong results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Margin declined 530 basis points, reflecting lower [ph] organic volume and the impact of acquisitions and deal costs. Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 16%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 9%. Book-to-bill was 1. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $451 million included an organic revenue decline of 2%. Earnings of $64 million declined 16% from the prior year, largely driven by production challenges at Hill PHOENIX, the impact of a disposition and product mix. The organic revenue decline was largely driven by tough comps in our can-shaping business. 
Margin was 14.2%, 140 basis points below last year. Within this result, production inefficiencies at Hill PHOENIX were $6 million or about 130 basis points of the decline. Bookings of $429 million were flat year-over-year and included organic growth of 6%. Organic growth was largely driven by strong order activity in our can-shaping business, which will be shipped in 2017. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Let's go to the overview slide on Page 9. Let me cover some highlights. 
Corporate expense was $27 million and net interest expense was $33 million, both largely in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 28%, generally in line with expectations. CapEx was $43 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect reduced forecasts. We now expect total revenue to decrease 4% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. 
We continue to expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, Energy's organic decline is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect further sequential revenue improvement into the fourth quarter. 
Fluids and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast have both been reduced 2 points. We now expect Fluids to decline 6% to 7% and Engineered Systems to be flat to 1% growth for the year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 3 points and now is negative 1% to flat. 
With regard to margin, we now expect adjusted margin to be around 14.1%. This excludes restructuring and deal and other costs. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be about $0.05. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing, restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.73 to $0.71. This has [ph] reduced $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior forecast. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings [ph] $0.11 to $0.09, reflecting a roughly $0.09 reduction from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions is $0.05 lower than our last forecast, reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions and also softer retail fueling activity. In total, net acquisitions will be about $0.07 accretive. 
Lastly, the combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate has been adjusted $0.01 from our prior forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3 to $3.05, down about $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.06 of this reduction is attributable to [ph] incremental fourth quarter deal and restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

As I look back over the last 18 months, our results certainly haven't been up to our expectations. That being said, I don't want to lose sight of the many positive achievements our businesses have made over this time. 
In Energy, we effectively managed through a cycle that saw U.S. rig count drop from 1,200 to 400 in 6 quarters. Through this down cycle, we streamlined our business while maintaining strong service levels. We are now very well-positioned to service our customers as activity in North America upstream markets improve. 
In Engineered Systems, we have expanded our Printing & Identification platform, which has historically been a strong performer. Our industrial platform has also performed very well over the last few years though facing some tough comps this year. I am excited about what we've done in this segment, especially with our recent acquisitions. 
Within Fluids, we have built a strong plastics and polymer business. We are also in the process of building a world-class retail fueling business. Our Fluids performance will improve through ongoing integrations and the addition of Wayne. 
Lastly, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we've done a good job diversifying our customer base and growing share with several customers. While this new business has certainly put stress on manufacturing, we have executed well on customer service, quality and delivery times. As previously noted, we have added scale in several markets where we see strong growth potential. In addition, we further focused our business by divesting non-core assets. 
In all, our recent acquisitions, combined with Wayne, will add over $700 million in revenue next year. These deals, together with a continuing recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and our commitment to improve margin, give me confidence we are on the right path. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. 
Now, Paul, let's take some questions."

I struggle sometimes to model you guys because when things come back, it's going to be probably pretty darn good. But when Energy comes back, is the incremental margin -- and I'm talking more on upstream stuff -- is the incremental margin higher in 2017 than it was in kind of the good years, let's just say, 3 years ago?

But to the heart of your question, with respect to the incremental margins on -- in a recovery phase, I would say in the early months of a recovery, let's say, the first -- at least the first 6 months, we are going to be quite diligent and not adding any cost unless they're absolutely required to service the customer. So I think as we see a 10%, a 15%, maybe even up to a 20% increase in volume, we will not be adding the cost base back like we would have had in 2014. I think as you get beyond the flex point of the manufacturing capability, and you'll see us adding some cost, but I think in the first few months of the recovery, you'll see incremental margins that will be quite attractive."

The guide that we have in the fourth quarter, I would like to believe I'm being cautious with this guide with not only the segment but specifically with Hill PHOENIX, but our guide for the fourth quarter does not assume any further improvements in our production variances beyond what we were running at in September.

I think 8% or it's high single digits, 8% or 9%. The bulk of the headwinds that we have experienced this year and again, I'm repeating myself from Joe's question had been in the upstream and midstream oil-related markets, the North America retail fueling market, and this is not Tokheim. This is now OPW, we've had growth in North America, but it's been less than we expected. And I think third quarter growth year-over-year for North America retail fueling, this is the OPW legacy business, I think was 6%. That said, North Canada was significantly lower than we expected, and it ended up being a decline in spending with customers or from customers in Canada. Tokheim, I think we're probably going to end the year, the second half will come in fairly close to our expectations of Tokheim that we had in July, but we do see some changes. Middle East is softer than we were looking at 3 months ago. China has degraded a bit, but not much. I'm talking a million or 2, but it hasn't changed that much since the July call.

That's giving us a little bit of I call it pause for, I guess, a -- maybe I hope what proves to be a bit of a cautious approach with respect to our fourth quarter guidance.

It correlated very, very well, Jeff. The -- we would expect that correlation to hold true for October and November as well. We're being a bit cautious here in our outlook for Energy with respect to the month of December. We have some concerns that we're going to see something similar to last year when customers went really quiet for the last 2 weeks of December. And in fact, many of our customers actually did not take product delivery at all through the final 2 weeks of the year. I don't know if we are going to see that same phenomena again this year, but we do expect a little bit of slowing in activity in December, and it's not connected to the rig count per se.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Our third quarter results were disappointing as the continuing weak macro environment, further declines in longer cycle oil and gas applications and production inefficiencies in our retail refrigeration business impacted both volume and earnings. These results were well below our expectations and more than offset solid improvements in our upstream drilling and production businesses, as well as continued strong performance in our Printing & Identification platform. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. and China activity declined organically, both sequentially and year-over-year. On an organic basis, our European markets improved sequentially and year-over-year. 
Within Energy, revenue was up 5% sequentially, largely within our drilling and production markets. This improvement was driven by increases in the North American rig count, principally in the Permian. The recent trends in rig count and oil price are constructive and supportive of continued near-term improvement in our early cycle businesses.  That said, within this segment, we continue to be challenged in longer cycle applications. 
Engineered Systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in Printing & Identification, which posted organic growth of 5%. In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%, though our vehicle service equipment business had a very strong quarter. 
Fluids posted 17% revenue growth, driven by acquisitions. However, our organic revenue decline of 9% reflects activity reductions in our businesses with longer cycle oil and gas exposure, as well as tough comps. 
Lastly, growth in retail fueling was less than anticipated while our businesses serving the hygienic and pharma markets continue to show very strong growth. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue declined 2% organically, principally driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment. Margin performance was well below expectations at Hill PHOENIX, primarily driven by production challenges in case manufacturing. We continue to implement changes to improve the business. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 2 deals since our last earnings call, both in Engineered Systems. We added a small automation and data analytics business and also acquired a European lift business. The addition of the lift business gives us a $500 million platform in the growing vehicle service equipment market. We also recently announced that the Wayne acquisition, due to an extended regulatory review in the U.K., will now likely close in the first quarter. Our teams are actively exploring measures to satisfy the regulator's concerns as quickly as possible. This matter relates only to the U.K. dispenser business, which is very small in the context of the transaction. 
Now looking forward. 
Within Energy, we are encouraged by the recent improvements in North American rig count and oil prices and believe both are constructive for continued near-term improvements in our business. That said, we anticipate our longer cycle oil and gas-related businesses to remain sequentially flat. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate activity in our industrial platform to remain soft due to a challenging macro industrial environment, as well as from activity deferrals as some customers pushed out order delivery into 2017. We expect our Printing & ID platform to have strong growth. 
Fluids' overall growth will be less than we expected in our prior forecast, driven by continued weak longer cycle oil and gas markets as well as CapEx reductions by integrated Energy customers. We expect the strong growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect customer spending to slow as we close out the year. We also expect margin challenges to continue as we work to improve manufacturing at Hill PHOENIX. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.83. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.1%, below last year, largely driven by lower revenue and the impact of acquisitions and production inefficiencies. 
Bookings decreased slightly from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. 
Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew 6%, while Energy was down 22% and Fluids decreased 9%. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Our backlog increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 1% organically. Free cash flow was $189 million for the quarter or 11% of revenue. We remain on track to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. 
Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1%, reflecting solid growth in Printing & Identification, partially offset by soft industrial markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 2%, driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment and softer customer spending in retail refrigeration. Food's organic decline of 9% was largely driven by upstream and midstream oil and gas exposure, tough comps and a lower-than-expected growth in retail fueling. Energy organic revenue was down 24%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 27%. 
Now on Slide 5. 
Energy revenue of $273 million decreased 25%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 5%, driven by our upstream drilling and artificial lift businesses. Earnings of $13 million included restructuring costs of $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, earnings were $18 million, and margin was 6.8%, in line with our expectations and sequentially improved. 
Current quarter activity -- order activity remains positive, but we believe we are on track to exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $271 million, a 10% sequential improvement. Book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Now on Slide 6. 
Engineered Systems revenue of $571 million was up 1% organically. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%, principally reflecting the impact of a disposition and also impacted by business mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $253 million increased 11%. Organic revenue was up 5%, reflecting solid global marking and coding and strong digital printing activity. Acquisitions added 7% growth. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was $317 million, which included an organic decline of 2%. The organic revenue decline was fairly broad-based and also reflected activity deferrals into the first quarter at Environmental Solutions. 
Margin was 17%, an 80 basis point decline. Bookings of $580 million were up 3%, which included organic growth of 5% in both platforms. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98. Industrial's book-to-bill was 1.04. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now on Slide 7. 
Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $413 million, while earnings decreased 12% to $66 million. Revenue performance reflects 27% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 9% decline in organic revenue. The organic result was driven by declines in our longer cycle upstream and midstream oil and gas businesses and tough comps, reflecting $18 million in project shipments last year that did not repeat.  In addition, spending from certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling, was lower than anticipated. This decline was partially offset by very strong results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Margin declined 530 basis points, reflecting low organic volume and the impact of acquisitions and deal costs. Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 16%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 9%. Book-to-bill was 1. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $451 million included an organic revenue decline of 2%. Earnings of $64 million declined 16% from the prior year, largely driven by production challenges at Hill PHOENIX, the impact of a disposition and product mix. The organic revenue decline was largely driven by tough comps in our can-shaping business. 
Margin was 14.2%, 140 basis points below last year. Within this result, production inefficiencies at Hill PHOENIX were $6 million or about 130 basis points of the decline. Bookings of $429 million were flat year-over-year and included organic growth of 6%. Organic growth was largely driven by strong order activity in our can-shaping business, which will be shipped in 2017. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Let's go to the overview slide on Page 9. Let me cover some highlights. 
Corporate expense was $27 million and net interest expense was $33 million, both largely in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 28%, generally in line with expectations. CapEx was $43 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect reduced forecasts. We now expect total revenue to decrease 4% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. 
We continue to expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, Energy's organic decline is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect further sequential revenue improvement into the fourth quarter. 
Fluids and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast have both been reduced 2 points. We now expect Fluids to decline 6% to 7% and Engineered Systems to be flat to 1% growth for the year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 3 points and now is negative 1% to flat. 
With regard to margin, we now expect adjusted margin to be around 14.1%. This excludes restructuring and deal and other costs. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be about $0.05. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing, restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.73 to $0.71. This has reduced $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior forecast. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings  $0.11 to $0.09, reflecting a roughly $0.09 reduction from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions is $0.05 lower than our last forecast, reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions and also softer retail fueling activity. In total, net acquisitions will be about $0.07 accretive. 
Lastly, the combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate has been adjusted $0.01 from our prior forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3 to $3.05, down about $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.06 of this reduction is attributable to incremental fourth quarter deal and restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

As I look back over the last 18 months, our results certainly haven't been up to our expectations. That being said, I don't want to lose sight of the many positive achievements our businesses have made over this time. 
In Energy, we effectively managed through a cycle that saw U.S. rig count drop from 1,200 to 400 in 6 quarters. Through this down cycle, we streamlined our business while maintaining strong service levels. We are now very well-positioned to service our customers as activity in North America upstream markets improve. 
In Engineered Systems, we have expanded our Printing & Identification platform, which has historically been a strong performer. Our industrial platform has also performed very well over the last few years though facing some tough comps this year. I am excited about what we've done in this segment, especially with our recent acquisitions. 
Within Fluids, we have built a strong plastics and polymer business. We are also in the process of building a world-class retail fueling business. Our Fluids performance will improve through ongoing integrations and the addition of Wayne. 
Lastly, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we've done a good job diversifying our customer base and growing share with several customers. While this new business has certainly put stress on manufacturing, we have executed well on customer service, quality and delivery times. As previously noted, we have added scale in several markets where we see strong growth potential. In addition, we further focused our business by divesting non-core assets. 
In all, our recent acquisitions, combined with Wayne, will add over $700 million in revenue next year. These deals, together with a continuing recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and our commitment to improve margin, give me confidence we are on the right path. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers.

So I think as we see a 10%, a 15%, maybe even up to a 20% increase in volume, we will not be adding the cost base back like we would have had in 2014. I think as you get beyond the flex point of the manufacturing capability, then you'll see us adding some cost.

One is a little bit better integrity around our common bond releases and a little bit better integrity around holding our production schedules once they're released. And that's been a challenge for the team over the last 3 or 4 months. The guide that we have in the fourth quarter, I would like to believe I'm being cautious with this guide, with not only this segment, but specifically, with Hill PHOENIX. But our guide for the fourth quarter does not assume any further improvements in our production variances beyond what we were running at in September. That said, we continue to work every week, every day to improve the manufacturing flow at Hill PHOENIX. You want to add anything to that, Brad?"

Tokheim, I think we're probably going to end the year. The second half will come in fairly close to our expectations of Tokheim that we had in July, but we do see some changes. Middle East is softer than we were looking at 3 months ago. China has degraded a bit, but not much. I'm talking 1 million or 2, but it hasn't changed that much since the July call.

And I labeled -- I label our marking and coding business as an OpEx item. It is interesting when you look at our order trends during the third quarter, what did give me some pause as we closed the quarter was September order rates were actually less than August. That's a bit unusual for us. We have really peeled that to try to understand what's going on and where we're seeing it. But -- and again, I'm going to repeat it. September order rates were less than August. That's giving us a little bit of I call it pause for, I guess, a -- maybe -- I hope what proves to be a bit of a cautious approach with respect to our fourth quarter guidance. If I were to share with you some early reads here in October, October order trends are actually a little bit better than we expected, and that's across-the-board. I will tell you something else we started to see here in the second quarter or in the third quarter. Not only with orders that were in our backlog, but with new orders, we can pretty easily circle about $50 million of revenue that was expected to ship either in the third quarter or the fourth quarter where customers have pushed it out to 2017.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Our third quarter results were disappointing as the continuing weak macro environment, further declines in longer cycle oil and gas applications and production inefficiencies in our retail refrigeration business impacted both volume and earnings. These results were well below our expectations and more than offset solid improvements in our upstream drilling and production businesses, as well as continued strong performance in our Printing & Identification platform. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. and China activity declined organically, both sequentially and year-over-year. On an organic basis, our European markets improved sequentially and year-over-year. 
Within Energy, revenue was up 5% sequentially, largely within our drilling and production markets. This improvement was driven by increases in the North American rig count, principally in the Permian. The recent trends in rig count and oil price are constructive and supportive of continued near-term improvement in our early cycle businesses.  That said, within this segment, we continue to be challenged in longer cycle applications. 
Engineered Systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in Printing & Identification, which posted organic growth of 5%. In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%, though our vehicle service equipment business had a very strong quarter. 
Fluids posted 17% revenue growth, driven by acquisitions. However, our organic revenue decline of 9% reflects activity reductions in our businesses with longer cycle oil and gas exposure, as well as tough comps. 
Lastly, growth in retail fueling was less than anticipated while our businesses serving the hygienic and pharma markets continue to show very strong growth. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue declined 2% organically, principally driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment. Margin performance was well below expectations at Hill PHOENIX, primarily driven by production challenges in case manufacturing. We continue to implement changes to improve the business. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 2 deals since our last earning call, both in Engineered Systems. We added a small automation and data analytics business and also acquired a European lift business. The addition of the lift business gives us a $500 million platform in the growing vehicle service equipment market. We also recently announced that the Wayne acquisition, due to an extended regulatory review in the U.K., will now likely close in the first quarter. Our teams are actively exploring measures to satisfy the regulator's concerns as quickly as possible. This matter relates only to the U.K. dispenser business, which is very small in the context of the transaction. 
Now looking forward. 
Within Energy, we are encouraged by the recent improvements in North American rig count and oil prices and believe both are constructive for continued near-term improvements in our business. That said, we anticipate our longer cycle oil and gas-related businesses to remain sequentially flat. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate activity in our industrial platform to remain soft due to a challenging macro industrial environment, as well as from activity deferrals as some customers pushed out order delivery into 2017. We expect our Printing & ID platform to have strong growth. 
Fluids' overall growth will be less than we expected in our prior forecast, driven by continued weak longer cycle oil and gas markets as well as CapEx reductions by integrated Energy customers. We expect the strong growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect customer spending to slow as we close out the year. We also expect margin challenges to continue as we work to improve manufacturing at Hill PHOENIX. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispos",1148,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. 
Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.83. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.1%, below last year, largely driven by lower revenue and the impact of acquisitions and production inefficiencies. 
Bookings decreased slightly from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. 
Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew 6%, while Energy was down 22% and Fluids decreased 9%. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Our backlog increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 1% organically. Free cash flow was $189 million for the quarter or 11% of revenue. We remain on track to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. 
Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1%, reflecting solid growth in Printing & Identification, partially offset by soft industrial markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 2%, driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment and softer customer spending in retail refrigeration. Food's organic decline of 9% was largely driven by upstream and midstream oil and gas exposure, tough comps and a lower-than-expected growth in retail fueling. Energy organic revenue was down 24%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 27%. 
Now on Slide 5. 
Energy revenue of $273 million decreased 25%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 5%, driven by our upstream drilling and artificial lift businesses. Earnings of $13 million included restructuring costs of $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, earnings were $18 million, and margin was 6.8%, in line with our expectations and sequentially improved. 
Current quarter activity -- order activity remains positive, but we believe we are on track to exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $271 million, a 10% sequential improvement. Book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Now on Slide 6. 
Engineered Systems revenue of $571 million was up 1% organically. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%, principally reflecting the impact of a disposition and also impacted by business mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $253 million increased 11%. Organic revenue was up 5%, reflecting solid global marking and coding and strong digital printing activity. Acquisitions added 7% growth. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was $317 million, which included an organic decline of 2%. The organic revenue decline was fairly broad-based and also reflected activity deferrals into the first quarter at Environmental Solutions. 
Margin was 17%, an 80-basis-point decline. Bookings of $580 million were up 3%, which included organic growth of 5% in both platforms. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98. Industrial's book-to-bill was 1.04. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now on Slide 7. 
Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $413 million, while earnings decreased 12% to $66 million. Revenue performance reflects 27% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 9% decline in organic revenue. The organic result was driven by declines in our longer cycle upstream and midstream oil and gas businesses and tough comps, reflecting $18 million in project shipments last year that did not repeat. In addition, spending from certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling, was lower than anticipated. This decline was partially offset by very strong results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Margin declined 530 basis points, reflecting low organic volume and the impact of acquisitions and deal costs. Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 16%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 9%. Book-to-bill was 1. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $451 million included an organic revenue decline of 2%. Earnings of $64 million declined 16% from the prior year, largely driven by production challenges at Hill PHOENIX, the impact of a disposition and product mix. The organic revenue decline was largely driven by tough comps in our can-shaping business. 
Margin was 14.2%, 140 basis points below last year. Within this result, production inefficiencies at Hill PHOENIX were $6 million or about 130 basis points of the decline. Bookings of $429 million were flat year-over-year and included organic growth of 6%. Organic growth was largely driven by strong order activity in our can-shaping business, which will be shipped in 2017. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Let's go to the overview slide on Page 9. Let me cover some highlights. 
Corporate expense was $27 million and net interest expense was $33 million, both largely in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 28%, generally in line with expectations. CapEx was $43 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect reduced forecasts. We now expect total revenue to decrease 4% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. 
We continue to expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, Energy's organic decline is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect further sequential revenue improvement into the fourth quarter. 
Fluids and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast have both been reduced 2 points. We now expect Fluids to decline 6% to 7% and Engineered Systems to be flat to 1% growth for the year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 3 points and now is negative 1% to flat. 
With regard to margin, we now expect adjusted margin to be around 14.1%. This excludes restructuring and deal and other costs. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be about $0.05. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing, restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.73 to $0.71. This has reduced $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior forecast. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.11 to $0.09, reflecting a roughly $0.09 reduction from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions is $0.05 lower than our last forecast, reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions and also softer retail fueling activity. In total, net acquisitions will be about $0.07 accretive. 
Lastly, the combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate has been adjusted $0.01 from our prior forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3 to $3.05, down about $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.06 of this reduction is attributable to incremental fourth quarter deal and restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

As I look back over the last 18 months, our results certainly haven't been up to our expectations. That being said, I don't want to lose sight of the many positive achievements our businesses have made over this time. 
In Energy, we effectively managed through a cycle that saw U.S. rig count drop from 1,200 to 400 in 6 quarters. Through this down cycle, we streamlined our business while maintaining strong service levels. We are now very well-positioned to service our customers as activity in North America upstream markets improve. 
In Engineered Systems, we have expanded our Printing & Identification platform, which has historically been a strong performer. Our industrial platform has also performed very well over the last few years though facing some tough comps this year. I am excited about what we've done in this segment, especially with our recent acquisitions. 
Within Fluids, we have built a strong plastics and polymer business. We are also in the process of building a world-class retail fueling business. Our Fluids performance will improve through ongoing integrations and the addition of Wayne. 
Lastly, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we've done a good job diversifying our customer base and growing share with several customers. While this new business has certainly put stress on manufacturing, we have executed well on customer service, quality and delivery times. As previously noted, we have added scale in several markets where we see strong growth potential. In addition, we further focused our business by divesting non-core assets. 
In all, our recent acquisitions, combined with Wayne, will add over $700 million in revenue next year. These deals, together with a continuing recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and our commitment to improve margin, give me confidence we are on the right path. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. 
Now, Paul, let's take some questions."

So I think as we see a 10%, a 15%, maybe even up to a 20% increase in volume, we will not be adding the cost base back like we would have had in 2014. I think as you get beyond the flex point of the manufacturing capability, then you'll see us adding some cost.

So across the board, within fluid transfer -- no, actually I don't want to say across the board, because in a couple of our businesses that deal with the hygienic and pharma markets, their order activity and business activity is up actually quite strong. I think 8% or -- it's high single digits, 8% or 9%. The bulk of the headwinds that we have experienced this year, and again, I'm repeating myself from Joe's question, have been in the upstream and midstream oil-related markets, the North America retail fueling market, and this is not Tokheim, this is now OPW. We've had growth in North America, but it's been less than we expected. And I think third quarter growth year-over-year for North America retail fueling, this is the OPW legacy business, I think was 6%. That said, North -- Canada was significantly lower than we expected, and it ended up being a decline in spending with customers or from customers in Canada. Tokheim, I think we're probably going to end the year. The second half will come in fairly close to our expectations of Tokheim that we had in July, but we do see some changes. Middle East is softer than we were looking at 3 months ago. China has degraded a bit, but not much. I'm talking 1 million or 2, but it hasn't changed that much since the July call. And absent my comment or excluding my comment on the Middle East, European activity has had growth with Tokheim in the second half."

And I labeled -- I label our marking and coding business as an OpEx item. It is interesting when you look at our order trends during the third quarter, what did give me some pause as we closed the quarter was September order rates were actually less than August. That's a bit unusual for us. We have really peeled that to try to understand what's going on and where we're seeing it. But -- and again, I'm going to repeat it. September order rates were less than August. That's giving us a little bit of I call it pause for, I guess, a -- maybe -- I hope what proves to be a bit of a cautious approach with respect to our fourth quarter guidance. If I were to share with you some early reads here in October, October order trends are actually a little bit better than we expected, and that's across-the-board. I will tell you something else we started to see here in the second quarter or in the third quarter. Not only with orders that were in our backlog, but with new orders, we can pretty easily circle about $50 million of revenue that was expected to ship either in the third quarter or the fourth quarter where customers have pushed it out to 2017.

Let me give you a data point here, a comp. So if I look at rig count, second quarter to third quarter, and my number's going to be the quarterly average from second quarter to third quarter. The rig count was up, I think 14%. And in our early cycle applications around drilling and artificial lift combined, the growth in that part of the business was almost identical to the increase in the rig count. It correlated very, very well, Jeff. The -- we would expect that correlation to hold true for October and November as well. We're being a bit cautious here in our outlook for Energy with respect to the month of December. We have some concerns that we're going to see something similar to last year when customers went really quiet for the last 2 weeks of December. In fact, many of our customers actually did not take product delivery at all through the final 2 weeks of the year. I don't know if we're going to see that same phenomena again this year, but we do expect a little bit of slowing in activity in December, and it's not connected to rig count per se. It's just connected to customer spending and I call it balance sheet management."

You have to appreciate that 20%, 22% -- better than 20%, I think it may be 22% or 23% of our artificial lift business is outside of North America, and that, especially in the Middle East and Latin America in the third quarter, we actually saw I think a small single-digit decline year-over-year in our non-North America business.

I think the -- what we continue to see in our longer cycle oil and gas applications is continuing budget cuts. And I'm not so sure that the customers are actually cutting their CapEx budgets, but they're being reallocated. We are convinced that's happening a little bit here in North America with respect to the EMV rollout. Even though we and our OPW legacy business have shown organic growth year-to-date, and we'll show it for the year, it is less than expected, and we are rather certain that part of that reduction is being diverted to the EMV rollout. So they're not necessarily cutting their budgets, but reallocating where some of the CapEx spending is going. In the industrial, that one's a tougher one to call, Nigel. I -- the orders do seem to be closing a bit longer, the cycle is a bit longer.

Our third quarter results were disappointing as the continuing weak macro environment, further declines in longer cycle oil and gas applications and production inefficiencies in our retail refrigeration business impacted both volume and earnings. These results were well below our expectations and more than offset solid improvements in our upstream drilling and production businesses, as well as continued strong performance in our Printing & Identification platform. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. and China activity declined organically, both sequentially and year-over-year. On an organic basis, our European markets improved sequentially and year-over-year. 
Within Energy, revenue was up 5% sequentially, largely within our drilling and production markets. This improvement was driven by increases in the North American rig count, principally in the Permian. The recent trends in rig count and oil price are constructive and supportive of continued near-term improvement in our early cycle businesses.  That said, within this segment, we continue to be challenged in longer cycle applications. 
Engineered Systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in Printing & Identification, which posted organic growth of 5%. In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%, though our vehicle service equipment business had a very strong quarter. 
Fluids posted 17% revenue growth, driven by acquisitions. However, our organic revenue decline of 9% reflects activity reductions in our businesses with longer cycle oil and gas exposure, as well as tough comps. 
Lastly, growth in retail fueling was less than anticipated while our businesses serving the hygienic and pharma markets continue to show very strong growth. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue declined 2% organically, principally driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment. Margin performance was well below expectations at Hill PHOENIX, primarily driven by production challenges in case manufacturing. We continue to implement changes to improve the business. 
Regarding acquisitions, we have closed 2 deals since our last earning call, both in Engineered Systems. We added a small automation and data analytics business and also acquired a European lift business. The addition of the lift business gives us a $500 million platform in the growing vehicle service equipment market. We also recently announced that the Wayne acquisition, due to an extended regulatory review in the U.K., will now likely close in the first quarter. Our teams are actively exploring measures to satisfy the regulator's concerns as quickly as possible. This matter relates only to the U.K. dispenser business, which is very small in the context of the transaction. 
Now looking forward. 
Within Energy, we are encouraged by the recent improvements in North American rig count and oil prices and believe both are constructive for continued near-term improvements in our business. That said, we anticipate our longer cycle oil and gas-related businesses to remain sequentially flat. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate activity in our industrial platform to remain soft due to a challenging macro industrial environment, as well as from activity deferrals as some customers pushed out order delivery into 2017. We expect our Printing & ID platform to have strong growth. 
Fluids' overall growth will be less than we expected in our prior forecast, driven by continued weak longer cycle oil and gas markets as well as CapEx reductions by integrated Energy customers. We expect the strong growth we've seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect customer spending to slow as we close out the year. We also expect margin challenges to continue as we work to improve manufacturing at Hill PHOENIX. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included an organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.83. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.1%, below last year, largely driven by lower revenue and the impact of acquisitions and production inefficiencies. 
Bookings decreased slightly from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. 
Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew 6%, while Energy was down 22% and Fluids decreased 9%. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Our backlog increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 1% organically. Free cash flow was $189 million for the quarter or 11% of revenue. We remain on track to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. 
Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1%, reflecting solid growth in Printing & Identification, partially offset by soft industrial markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 2%, driven by tough comps in can-shaping equipment and softer customer spending in retail refrigeration. Food's organic decline of 9% was largely driven by upstream and midstream oil and gas exposure, tough comps and a lower-than-expected growth in retail fueling. Energy organic revenue was down 24%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids, with 27%. 
Now on Slide 5. 
Energy revenue of $273 million decreased 25%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 5%, driven by our upstream drilling and artificial lift businesses. Earnings of $13 million included restructuring costs of $5 million. Adjusting for these costs, earnings were $18 million, and margin was 6.8%, in line with our expectations and sequentially improved. 
Current quarter activity -- order activity remains positive, but we believe we are on track to exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $271 million, a 10% sequential improvement. Book-to-bill finished at 0.99. 
Now on Slide 6. 
Engineered Systems revenue of $571 million was up 1% organically. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%, principally reflecting the impact of a disposition and also impacted by business mix. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $253 million increased 11%. Organic revenue was up 5%, reflecting solid global marking and coding and strong digital printing activity. Acquisitions added 7% growth. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was $317 million, which included an organic decline of 2%. The organic revenue decline was fairly broad-based and also reflected activity deferrals into the first quarter at Environmental Solutions. 
Margin was 17%, an 80-basis-point decline. Bookings of $580 million were up 3%, which included organic growth of 5% in both platforms. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98. Industrial's book-to-bill was 1.04. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.02. 
Now on Slide 7. 
Within Fluids, revenue increased 17% to $413 million, while earnings decreased 12% to $66 million. Revenue performance reflects 27% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 9% decline in organic revenue. The organic result was driven by declines in our longer cycle upstream and midstream oil and gas businesses and tough comps, reflecting $18 million in project shipments last year that did not repeat. In addition, spending from certain integrated Energy customers, particularly in retail fueling, was lower than anticipated. This decline was partially offset by very strong results in our hygienic and pharma markets. 
Margin declined 530 basis points, reflecting low organic volume and the impact of acquisitions and deal costs. Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 16%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 9%. Book-to-bill was 1. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $451 million included an organic revenue decline of 2%. Earnings of $64 million declined 16% from the prior year, largely driven by production challenges at Hill PHOENIX, the impact of a disposition and product mix. The organic revenue decline was largely driven by tough comps in our can-shaping business. 
Margin was 14.2%, 140 basis points below last year. Within this result, production inefficiencies at Hill PHOENIX were $6 million or about 130 basis points of the decline. Bookings of $429 million were flat year-over-year and included organic growth of 6%. Organic growth was largely driven by strong order activity in our can-shaping business, which will be shipped in 2017. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Let's go to the overview slide on Page 9. Let me cover some highlights. 
Corporate expense was $27 million and net interest expense was $33 million, both largely in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 28%, generally in line with expectations. CapEx was $43 million in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect reduced forecasts. We now expect total revenue to decrease 4% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. 
We continue to expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, Energy's organic decline is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect further sequential revenue improvement into the fourth quarter. 
Fluids and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast have both been reduced 2 points. We now expect Fluids to decline 6% to 7% and Engineered Systems to be flat to 1% growth for the year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered 3 points and now is negative 1% to flat. 
With regard to margin, we now expect adjusted margin to be around 14.1%. This excludes restructuring and deal and other costs. 
Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2016 to be about $0.05. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity, pricing, restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.73 to $0.71. This has reduced $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior forecast. 
Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.11 to $0.09, reflecting a roughly $0.09 reduction from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions is $0.05 lower than our last forecast, reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions and also softer retail fueling activity. In total, net acquisitions will be about $0.07 accretive. 
Lastly, the combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate has been adjusted $0.01 from our prior forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3 to $3.05, down about $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.06 of this reduction is attributable to incremental fourth quarter deal and restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

As I look back over the last 18 months, our results certainly haven't been up to our expectations. That being said, I don't want to lose sight of the many positive achievements our businesses have made over this time. 
In Energy, we effectively managed through a cycle that saw U.S. rig count drop from 1,200 to 400 in 6 quarters. Through this down cycle, we streamlined our business while maintaining strong service levels. We are now very well-positioned to service our customers as activity in North America upstream markets improve. 
In Engineered Systems, we have expanded our Printing & Identification platform, which has historically been a strong performer. Our industrial platform has also performed very well over the last few years though facing some tough comps this year. I am excited about what we've done in this segment, especially with our recent acquisitions. 
Within Fluids, we have built a strong plastics and polymer business. We are also in the process of building a world-class retail fueling business. Our Fluids performance will improve through ongoing integrations and the addition of Wayne. 
Lastly, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we've done a good job diversifying our customer base and growing share with several customers. While this new business has certainly put stress on manufacturing, we have executed well on customer service, quality and delivery times. As previously noted, we have added scale in several markets where we see strong growth potential. In addition, we further focused our business by divesting non-core assets. 
In all, our recent acquisitions, combined with Wayne, will add over $700 million in revenue next year. These deals, together with a continuing recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and our commitment to improve margin, give me confidence we are on the right path. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. 
Now, Paul, let's take some questions."

So I think as we see a 10%, a 15%, maybe even up to a 20% increase in volume, we will not be adding the cost base back like we would have had in 2014. I think as you get beyond the flex point of the manufacturing capability, then you'll see us adding some cost. But I think in the first few months of the recovery, you'll see incremental margins that will be quite attractive."

I think 8% or -- it's high single digits, 8% or 9%. The bulk of the headwinds that we have experienced this year, and again, I'm repeating myself from Joe's question, have been in the upstream and midstream oil-related markets, the North America retail fueling market, and this is not Tokheim, this is now OPW. We've had growth in North America, but it's been less than we expected. And I think third quarter growth year-over-year for North America retail fueling, this is the OPW legacy business, I think was 6%. That said, North -- Canada was significantly lower than we expected, and it ended up being a decline in spending with customers or from customers in Canada. Tokheim, I think we're probably going to end the year. The second half will come in fairly close to our expectations of Tokheim that we had in July, but we do see some changes. Middle East is softer than we were looking at 3 months ago. China has degraded a bit, but not much. I'm talking 1 million or 2, but it hasn't changed that much since the July call. And absent my comment or excluding my comment on the Middle East, European activity has had growth with Tokheim in the second half."

September order rates were less than August. That's giving us a little bit of I call it pause for, I guess, a -- maybe -- I hope what proves to be a bit of a cautious approach with respect to our fourth quarter guidance. If I were to share with you some early reads here in October, October order trends are actually a little bit better than we expected, and that's across-the-board. I will tell you something else we started to see here in the second quarter or in the third quarter.

We're being a bit cautious here in our outlook for Energy with respect to the month of December.
