285544,306239592,940434,"L Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: Sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are",2103,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: Sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strength of our brands and our differentiation and a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals.
While we manage the business conservatively, we utilize speed to chase back into what was working and maximize our opportunities. We improved our full year operating margin by 90 basis points to 18% and we grew operating income dollars by 12%. We also continue to return substantial value to shareholders. We increased our annual dividend by 20% to $2.40 per share. We declared a special dividend of $2 per share and authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to 2016, we're optimistic and confident in our opportunities for growth. As you know, we manage the business conservatively with respect to inventory and expenses to protect against any potential downside. Reflecting this mindset, the high end of our full year guidance implies a conservative view at mid single-digit percentage growth in operating income dollars and a decline in the operating income rate. We would not be satisfied with that outcome, and we will continue to leverage speed to chase back into what's working and deliver upside to our forecast.
We remain committed to our goal of 10% or better annual growth and operating income dollars and an operating income rate in the high-teens. Looking at the fourth quarter performance in more detail, as described on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 8% to $4.395 billion and comps increased 6% on top of 6% last year. The gross margin rate increased 50 basis points to 45.6%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A expense leveraged by 60 basis points. The operating income rate increased by 100 basis points to 24.5%, and operating income dollars increased 13% to $1.078 billion.
The tax rate in the quarter of 35.2% provided $0.08 of upside to our initial guidance. Earnings per share increased 14% to $2.15 versus a $1.89 last year. Foreign currency had a negative impact of about $0.05 to 2015 fourth quarter EPS.
Turning to our full year results on Page 5. Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.99 versus $3.50 last year. FX negatively impacted full year 2015 results by about $0.13. Net sales increased 6% to $12.154 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. The gross margin rate increased 80 basis points to 42.8%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate leverage by 10 basis points.
Pages 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 18%, up 90 basis points last year. Operating income dollars increased $238.4 million or 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business segments.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 4% versus last year, down 6% on a 2-year basis. Inventories are clean and well-positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square-foot up in the mid single-digit range. 
Operating cash flow in 2015 was $1.869 billion, free cash flow was $1.142 billion and capital expenditures were $727 million. We repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock in 2015 for $483 million. 
Our 2016 forecast, as detailed on Page 11, reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works real estate, including a new Victoria's Secret flagship store on Fifth Avenue. Increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, incremental interest expense related to last October's note issuance and a higher tax rate.
Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a 2% to 4% comp increase, including an updated February comp of up mid single-digits at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. To be clear, the store only comp is expected to be up mid single-digits at both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The earlier Easter this year will negatively impact March comps and positively impact April.
As noted in our press release, beginning with our February sales release, we will include direct sales with reported comps consistent with industry practice. We expect the first quarter gross margin way to be down to last year driven by some decline in the merchandise margin rate, primarily driven by foreign exchange and buying and occupancy deleverage. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs. We expect interest and other nonoperating expense in the first quarter to be about $100 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.61 result. This forecast includes a total negative impact of about $0.08 related to foreign currency, incremental interest expense and preopening cost for the flagship Fifth Avenue Victoria's Secret store.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 to 2 points higher comps due to growth in square footage. Foreign currency translation is expected to have a slight negative impact to total sales growth. 
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be down to last year, driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy deleverage. The merchandise margin rate decline is driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency. Excluding this, we expect the merchandise margin rate to be about flat. 
We expect the full year SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $390 million, about $0.12 a share higher than last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37% versus 36.2% in 2015.
The higher projected tax rate in 2016 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.05. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 292 million in the first quarter and the full year. The lower share count will benefit earnings per share year-over-year by about $0.08. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be between $3.90 and $4.10. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10. We're projecting 2016 CapEx between $900 million and $1 billion. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. 
As detailed on Page 13 in the presentation, Victoria's Secret's square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of the existing Victoria's Secret stores and 13 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 5%, driven by 27 net new openings and 145 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 4%. Our increased investment in real estate will result in high single-digit percentage increase in buying and occupancy expense in 2016, about 3 points higher than growth in 2015.
The Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue store will drive incremental expense related to preopening cost of about $30 million. Bath & Body Works will also see more pressure from buying and occupancy costs as a result of our investment in Bath & Body Works and White Barn remodels. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2016 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient under our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Turning to Victoria's Secret. I'd like to express our appreciation to Sharen for her leadership and all that she accomplished in her 16 years with the business. Victoria's Secret is well-positioned for growth. We have a strong brand, great momentum and a highly talented team that is capable of leading the brand to continued success. Now turning to results. 
The Victoria's Secret segment had a strong fourth quarter, growing both sales and earnings to record levels. Total sales increased 9% to $2.6 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. Operating income increased $84 million or 17% to $593.6 million, and our operating income rate increased 150 basis points to 22.7%. 
Our focus on reading and reacting with speed and agility positioned us to get back into trends more quickly and drove mid-teen growth in bras, high single-digit growth in panties and low 20s growth in PINK loungewear. Specific to the key holiday time period in the quarter, we delivered record results both Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. We continue to reposition our beauty category to be more consistent to Victoria's Secret brand. Results for the business were down to last year, as expected.
Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year driven by strength in both stores and direct. The rate was about flat to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year in line with expectations, driven by planned investment in PINK and additional beauty inventory to support the fantasy's restage. Now let's turn to the specific channel performance starting with stores. 
We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance as sales and operating income increased to record levels on top of record levels last year. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. We were pleased with the customer response of our holiday storytelling, which links a consistent team across all our customer touch points. We also added an incremental bra launch in December, which is successful in driving newness and holiday right product for gifting and self purchase. 
As a result, we had strong sales growth across our key businesses, bras, panties, sleepwear and PINK loungewear. Merchandise margin dollars also increased versus last year. Merchandise margin rate was about flat, as fall price selling strength in PINK was offset by a planned sport event in January declines in beauty as we reposition in this category and an unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A rates leveraged in the quarter as we remain focused on disciplined expense management. For the quarter, operating income dollars and rate both increased.
Now turning to the direct channel. Strong performance during the holiday period drove record sales and operating income results in the direct channel. Fourth quarter sales increased 15% to $567 million, driven by strength across the assortment. Bras, panties, sleep, PINK and sport all experienced double-digit growth to last year. We fully anniversary last year's exit from apparel during the fourth quarter. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to the store to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly, driven by the sales increase, margin rate expansion and expense leverage.
Turning to our full year results. Total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 6% to $7.7 billion. Operating income increased by $119 million to $1.4 billion. And the operating income rate improved by 50 basis points to 18.1%. In the store channel, comps increased 5% with total store channel sales up 7%. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year with rate about flat. Total expenses leverage versus last year. As a result, operating income dollars increased versus last year and the rate was about flat.
In the direct channel, sales increased 3% as 16% growth in go forward categories more than offset the exit of non-go-forward apparel sales last year. The merchandise margin rate increased driven by the category mix benefit from the apparel exit and expenses leverage. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were up significantly.
Looking ahead to 2016. We will plan the business conservatively while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read-and-react. We will continue to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create an even better shopping experience for our customers. 
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter, building on record fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive solid growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 8% or $116 million to last year. Comps increased 6% and our direct channel sales grew by 24%. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses, our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitize business and bathroom fragrance assortment. 
Our concept of the Perfect Christmas resonated well with our customers, and we were pleased with the acceptance of our holiday assortments. The visual appeal of the stores and the in-store execution of our plants. The momentum from holiday continued with a solid semiannual sale performance that builds in last year's strong sales results. Promotional activity for the quarter was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that included fewer, but more impactful activities that generated the strong response from our customers.
For the quarter, operating income was $487 million, up 8% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 10 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by increase in buying and occupancy expense as we continue our store investment program. Operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by continued unfavorable foreign exchange pressure in our Canadian business. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year and annual sales were over $360 million.
For fiscal 2015, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps increased 5%. Operating income was $858 million, up 16% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 190 basis points to 23.9%, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate and expense leverage. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor customer preferences and leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities, allowing us to put the right products for full-price selling in front of our customers at the last time. 
We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with the let's go theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. Our inventories are well-positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customer's preferences. 
We remain focused on making the appropriate investments in our business, including the necessary increases in occupancy costs in order to continue our white spot and Bath & Body Works remodel and expansion program. We've been pleased to the results to date of our White Barn format. We ended 2015 with 67 of our stores in the format containing White Barn. Of the 27 net openings and 145 remodels that Stuart mentioned in his remarks, we will -- although contain our White Barn concept either in a side-by-side or a shop-in-shop format. 
And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

Our foundation is very solid.",499,"Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We continue to be very confident about our opportunity for growth internationally. Our brands are well-received wherever we open around the world and our execution has been excellent. Our foundation is very solid. 
We saw strong growth in retail sales on a constant currency basis across all of our formats in the fourth quarter. However, not all of this growth translated into recognized revenue. Fourth quarter recognized revenue in the international segment increased by 6% and operating income declined by $1.4 million to $28 million. Foreign currency had a balance of 5 points impact on our recorded revenue growth and about a $3 million negative impact to operating income.
We had very solid growth in both recognized revenue and operating income in our company-owned stores in the U.K, in our franchise full assortment stores and in our Bath & Body Works stores. However, the VSBA business experienced a significant decline in both revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter.
This decline was primarily the result of foreign currency translation, softness in travel retail and tourism generally and a decline in shipments of beauty products in anticipation of the new Victoria's Secret vanities collection being launched in the spring. 
In the full year 2015, the International segment revenue increased by 15% to $385.2 million and operating income increased by 13% to $87.9 million. FX negatively impacted 2015 operating income by about $15 million. So absent the FX impact, operating income would have increased 32% and the rates would have increased by 200 basis points to 25.2%. We opened 144 new stores in 2015 to end the year with 531 stores in the International segment, and we plan to open about 175 stores in 2016.
At Victoria's Secret International, we're pleased with the performance of our full assortment stores. Our London flagship store on Bond Street, as well as our 13 mall stores are operating very well, and we'll open another 5 stores in the U.K. this year. 
In the Middle East, we now have 16 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 3 PINK stores open under our partnership with Alshaya. These stores continue to do well and will open another 12 or so full assortment stores this year, including in new geographies such as China, Mexico, Singapore and earlier this month, in Russia. We'll also open about 5 more PINK stores. 
In the VSBA business, we ended the year with 373 locations, about 1/3, of which are in airports. We'll open another 90 or so across the globe in 2016. In Bath & Body Works, we now have 125 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships, and we continue to be very pleased with performance of these stores and expect to open another 65 or so BBW stores in the year ahead.
So in summary, despite headwinds from foreign exchange, we made significant progress internationally in 2015, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, which is great execution of our brands wherever we go."

Can you just talk a little bit more if you have some direction on the amount of gross margin deleverage? How much of that is coming from preopening rent? And is the big change in preopening rent in 2016 primarily related to the Fifth Avenue store?

The deleverage in buying and occupancy is more significant than the merchandise margin decline. Again, the merch margin decline is largely a function of foreign currency, but the P&L deleverage is the more significant component. And the preopening related to Fifth Avenue is the biggest driver of that. As Nick commented on, however, we are, which we view as a very good thing, these investments are good, investing in remodeling Bath & Body Works and location including White Barn elements. So the P&L deleverage is the bigger part, to answer your question. The fact that we're building a global flagship on Fifth Avenue, we view as a very positive thing. And it certainly puts some short-term pressure in the P&L. But for our business, over the long term, it's a terrific thing. It's going to be a great store. And again, the opportunity to remodel Bath & Body and include White Barn in those remodels is also a very good thing, but it put some short-term pressure on the P&L."

Our views about expanding's square footage for a PINK haven't changed at all performing we believe that there's substantial sales growth and profit growth opportunity adding more square footage for PINK, and we'll continue to do that through a combination of remodels and freestanding PINKs. But there will be year-to-year variation in the number of freestanding PINKs versus growth through remodels that again, is a function of mall by mall circumstances that are in front of us. So that's how we look at it. And the 6 -- 2016 PINK freestanding new stores, it looks like we're, as you point out, we're going to open 5 and close 1 for a metaphor.

There are 4 businesses, reminder, there are 4 businesses within the international this. So the Victoria's Secret full assortment own stores in the U.K, the 4 segments are into the franchise business, the Bath & Body Works international business and the franchise arrangement, and there's VSBA. 3 of those 4 businesses have very strong year and very strong quarter. As you rightly point out, our problem in the segment was VSBA. And I'd say there are 3 drivers of that difficulty, as I said, in the 3 prepared remarks and they're about in equal measure. One is that, which impacts both recognized revenue and operating income. The second is a general softness in travel retail. Particularly people from Russia, from China and tourist destinations that are related to the Middle East and security pressure there have been effected. And I think there has been written about life about our travel retail industry. And the third, which we absolutely own and want to take responsibility for is weakness in our Victoria's Secret beauty business, particularly related to the fantasy's relaunch. And that affected our business globally. To the questions about how we feel about the fundamentals of the business and store closures. We feel very, very good about VSBA. It's a very profitable business, has a lot of runway ahead of it. It tees up the brand internationally very well for us. And we will continue to increase our footprint in that business. The closures, and I think there will be maybe 10, we're guessing. We can see about 5 right now, and we're positioning that it may be up to 10. Coming from a number of things. One is on occasion, we close the VSBA and older to the places stores, that's good news. That's a really good thing. Second is, the nature of travel retailers that leases tend to be 3-year leases. So just by normal course of business, some of our stores that are 5 years old or more will be coming up for renewal. Another times, they're just relocation. So there's nothing sinister in the closure numbers we have a lot of confidence in the business and the foundations are strong."

But it's only been -- we've only really been able to do it because of product acceptance. So we think about how number one goal is really putting the product out if she likes and trying to get it to full price. And in certain businesses we've seen a very, very good traction.

And the complexity of that will increase significantly as we're opening in new markets with new partners that we haven't operated before. So as I mentioned, we have Russia that already opened earlier this month. We have Mexico coming. We have China. We have Singapore. We're actively in there will sitting lots of the geographies as well. So I think you'll see a real ramp-up in the full assortment stores participation of the business. How you model for that, I recognize it's tricky. You've got 4 businesses and you've got 3 different models all involved in wholesale. It's difficult to do. I would say, overall, you should expect our revenue growth to be below that of our store growth as the stores are skewed to smaller stores.

In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: Sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are",2100,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: Sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strength of our brands and our differentiation, and a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals.
While we manage the business conservatively, we utilize speed to chase back into what was working and maximize our opportunities. We improved our full year operating margin by 90 basis points to 18% and we grew operating income dollars by 12%. We also continue to return substantial value to shareholders. We increased our annual dividend by 20% to $2.40 per share. We declared a special dividend of $2 per share and authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to 2016, we're optimistic and confident in our opportunities for growth. As you know, we manage the business conservatively with respect to inventory and expenses to protect against any potential downside. Reflecting this mindset, the high end of our full year guidance implies a conservative view at mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income dollars and a decline in the operating income rate. We would not be satisfied with that outcome, and we will continue to leverage speed to chase back into what's working and deliver upside to our forecast.
We remain committed to our goal of 10% or better annual growth and operating income dollars and an operating income rate in the high-teens. Looking at the fourth quarter performance in more detail, as described on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 8% to $4.395 billion and comps increased 6% on top of 6% last year. The gross margin rate increased 50 basis points to 45.6%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A expense leveraged by 60 basis points. The operating income rate increased by 100 basis points to 24.5% and operating income dollars increased 13% to $1.078 billion.
The tax rate in the quarter of 35.2% provided $0.08 of upside to our initial guidance. Earnings per share increased 14% to $2.15 versus $1.89 last year. Foreign currency had a negative impact of about $0.05 to 2015 fourth quarter EPS.
Turning to our full year results on Page 5. Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.99 versus $3.50 last year. FX negatively impacted full year 2015 results by about $0.13. Net sales increased 6% to $12.154 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. The gross margin rate increased 80 basis points to 42.8%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate leveraged by 10 basis points.
Pages 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 18%, up 90 basis points to last year. Operating income dollars increased $238.4 million or 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business segments.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 4% versus last year, down 6% on a 2-year basis. Inventories are clean and well positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square-foot up in the mid-single-digit range. 
Operating cash flow in 2015 was $1.869 billion, free cash flow was $1.142 billion and capital expenditures were $727 million. We repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock in 2015 for $483 million. 
Our 2016 forecast, as detailed on Page 11, reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret, in Bath & Body Works real estate, including a new Victoria's Secret flagship store on Fifth Avenue. Increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, incremental interest expense related to last October's note issuance and a higher tax rate.
Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a 2% to 4% comp increase, including an updated February comp of up mid-single digits at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. To be clear, the store-only comp is expected to be up mid-single digits at both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The earlier Easter this year will negatively impact March comps and positively impact April.
As noted in our press release, beginning with our February sales release, we will include direct sales with reported comps consistent with industry practice. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be down to last year driven by some decline in the merchandise margin rate, primarily driven by foreign exchange and buying and occupancy deleverage. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs. We expect interest and other nonoperating expense in the first quarter to be about $100 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.61 result. This forecast includes a total negative impact of about $0.08 related to foreign currency, incremental interest expense and preopening cost for the flagship Fifth Avenue Victoria's Secret store.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 to 2 points higher than comps due to growth in square footage. Foreign currency translation is expected to have a slight negative impact to total sales growth. 
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be down to last year, driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy deleverage. The merchandise margin rate decline is driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency. Excluding this, we expect the merchandise margin rate to be about flat. 
We expect the full year SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $390 million, about $0.12 a share higher than last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37% versus 36.2% in 2015. The higher projected tax rate in 2016 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.05. 
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 292 million in the first quarter and the full year. The lower share count will benefit earnings per share year-over-year by about $0.08. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be between $3.90 and $4.10. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10. We're projecting 2016 CapEx between $900 million and $1 billion. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. 
As detailed on Page 13 in the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 13 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 5%, driven by 27 net new openings and 145 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 4%. Our increased investment in real estate will result in high single-digit percentage increase in buying and occupancy expense in 2016, about 3 points higher than growth in 2015.
The Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue store will drive incremental expense related to preopening cost of about $30 million. Bath & Body Works will also see more pressure from buying and occupancy cost as a result of our investment in Bath & Body Works and White Barn remodels. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2016 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient under our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Turning to Victoria's Secret. I'd like to express our appreciation to Sharen for her leadership and all that she accomplished in her 16 years with the business. Victoria's Secret is well positioned for growth. We have a strong brand, great momentum and a highly talented team that is capable of leading the brand to continued success. Now turning to results. 
The Victoria's Secret segment had a strong fourth quarter, growing both sales and earnings to record levels. Total sales increased 9% to $2.6 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. Operating income increased $84 million or 17% to $593.6 million, and our operating income rate increased 150 basis points to 22.7%. 
Our focus on reading and reacting with speed and agility positioned us to get back into trends more quickly and drove mid-teen growth in bras, high single-digit growth in panties and low 20s growth in PINK loungewear. Specific to the key holiday time period in the quarter, we delivered record results both Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. We continue to reposition our beauty category to be more consistent with Victoria's Secret brand. Results for the business were down to last year as expected.
Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year driven by strength in both stores and direct. The rate was about flat to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year in line with expectations, driven by planned investments in PINK and additional beauty inventory to support the Fantasies restage. 
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance starting with stores. 
We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance as sales and operating income increased to record levels on top of record levels last year. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. We were pleased with the customer response to our holiday storytelling, which linked a consistent theme across all our customer touch points. We also added an incremental bra launch in December, which is successful in driving newness and holiday right product for gifting and self purchase. As a result, we had strong sales growth across our key businesses, bras, panties, sleepwear and PINK loungewear. 
Merchandise margin dollars also increased versus last year. Merchandise margin rate was about flat, as full-price selling strength in PINK was offset by a planned sport event in January, declines in beauty as we reposition this category and an unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A rates leveraged in the quarter as we remain focused on disciplined expense management. For the quarter, operating income dollars and rate both increased.
Now turning to the direct channel. Strong performance during the holiday period drove record sales and operating income results in the direct channel. Fourth quarter sales increased 15% to $567 million, driven by strength across the assortment. Bras, panties, sleep, PINK and sport all experienced double-digit growth to last year. We fully anniversary-ed last year's exit from apparel during the fourth quarter. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly driven by the sales increase, margin rate expansion and expense leverage.
Turning to our full year results. Total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 6% to $7.7 billion. Operating income increased by $119 million to $1.4 billion. And the operating income rate improved by 50 basis points to 18.1%. In the store channel, comps increased 5% with total store channel sales up 7%. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year with rate about flat. Total expenses leveraged versus last year. As a result, operating income dollars increased versus last year and the rate was about flat.
In the direct channel, sales increased 3% as 16% growth in go-forward categories more than offset the exit of non-go-forward apparel sales last year. The merchandise margin rate increased driven by the category mix benefit from the apparel exit and expenses leveraged. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were up significantly
Looking ahead to 2016. We will plan the business conservatively while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react. We will continue to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create an even better shopping experience for our customers. 
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter, building on record fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive solid growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 8% or $116 million to last year. Comps increased 6% and our direct channel sales grew by 24%. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses, our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and bathroom fragrance assortment. 
Our concept of the Perfect Christmas resonated well with our customers, and we were pleased with the acceptance of our holiday assortments, the visual appeal of the stores and the in-store execution of our plans. The momentum from holiday continued with a solid semiannual sale performance that builds on last year's strong sales results. Promotional activity for the quarter was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that included fewer, but more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers.
For the quarter, operating income was $487 million, up 8% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 10 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by increase in buying and occupancy expense as we continue our store investment program. Operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by continued unfavorable foreign exchange pressure in our Canadian business. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year, and annual sales were over $360 million.
For fiscal 2015, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps increased 5%. Operating income was $858 million, up 16% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 190 basis points to 23.9%, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate and expense leverage. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor customer preferences and leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities, allowing us to put the right products for full-price selling in front of our customers at the right time. 
We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our Let's go to Italy theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. Our inventories are well positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customer's preferences. 
We remain focused on making the appropriate investments in our business, including the necessary increases in occupancy costs in order to continue our White Barn and Bath & Body Works remodel and expansion program. We've been pleased with the results to date of our White Barn format. We ended 2015 with 67 of our stores in the format containing White Barn. Of the 27 net openings and 145 remodels that Stuart mentioned in his remarks, we will -- all will contain our White Barn concept either in the side-by-side or a shop-in-shop format. 
And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

Our brands are well received wherever we open around the world, and our execution has been excellent. Our foundation is very solid. 
We saw a strong growth in retail sales on a constant currency basis across all of our formats in the fourth quarter. However, not all of this growth translated into recognized revenue. Fourth quarter recognized revenue in the international segment increased by 6% and operating income declined by $1.4 million to $28 million. Foreign currency had a balance of 5 points impact on our recorded revenue growth and about a $3 million negative impact to operating income.
We had very solid growth in both recognized revenue and operating income in our company-owned stores in the U.K., in our franchise full assortment stores and in our Bath & Body Works stores. However, the VSBA business experienced a significant decline in both revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter.
This decline was primarily the result of foreign currency translation, softness in travel retail and tourism generally and a decline in shipments of beauty products in anticipation of the new Victoria's Secret Fantasies collection being launched in the spring. 
In the full year 2015, the international segment revenue increased by 15% to $385.2 million and operating income increased by 13% to $87.9 million. FX negatively impacted 2015 operating income by about $15 million. So absent the FX impact, operating income would have increased 32% and the rates would have increased by 200 basis points to 25.2%. We opened 144 new stores in 2015 to end the year with 531 stores in the international segment, and we plan to open about 175 stores in 2016.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. Our London flagship store on Bond Street as well as our 13 mall stores are operating very well, and we'll open another 5 stores in the U.K. this year. 
In the Middle East, we now have 16 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 3 PINK stores open under our partnership with Alshaya. These stores continue to do well and will open another 12 or so full assortment stores this year, including in new geographies such as China, Mexico, Singapore and earlier this month, in Russia. We'll also open about 5 more PINK stores. 
In the VSBA business, we ended the year with 373 locations, about 1/3, of which are in airports. We'll open another 90 or so across the globe in 2016. In Bath & Body Works, we now have 125 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships, and we continue to be very pleased with performance of these stores and expect to open another 65 or so BBW stores in the year ahead.
So in summary, despite headwinds from foreign exchange, we made significant progress internationally in 2015, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, which is great execution of our brands wherever we go."

In terms of the gross margin decline particularly in Q1, the deleverage in buying and occupancy is more significant than the merchandise margin decline. Again, the merch margin decline is largely a function of foreign currency, but the B&O deleverage is the more significant component. And the preopening related to Fifth Avenue is the biggest driver of that. As Nick commented on, however, we are -- which we view as a very good thing, these investments are good, investing in remodeling Bath & Body Works and location including White Barn elements. So the B&O deleverage is the bigger part, to answer your question. The fact that we're building a global flagship on Fifth Avenue, we view as a very positive thing. And it certainly puts some short-term pressure in the P&L. But for our business, over the long term, it's a terrific thing. It's going to be a great store. And again, the opportunity to remodel Bath & Body include White Barn in those remodels is also a very good thing, but it puts some short-term pressure on the P&L."

And as you know, over the course of the last couple of years, we've taken some ticket increases that we haven't had any barrier to. And I think our ongoing goal is always to think about how do we get paid for innovation that we put in, how do we get paid for the newness in the way that gets us to full-price selling. As it relates to whether we think we have power, I think, in both our signature business as well as our home business, as we continue to see strength in it, there's obviously opportunity to look at how are we priced and is there an opportunity for either price-up or aggressive full-price selling. And that's typically part of the course in terms of how we actually think about running the business on a day-to-day basis. So price is, obviously, top of mind for us."

I mean, the pricing power starts with the power of the brand and the differentiation that we provide through the brand, through the store experience, through the merchandise. And I would say the balance point, as we think about it, is always being mindful of reinvesting in the product and being thoughtful about driving transactions in units versus rate. And I think the business, including at Victoria's Secret, works hard to strike that balance and has the range of pricing, evaluations, including good/better/best pricing and so on. So I think we look at pricing carefully. The particular area that we're thinking about, I imagine, the number of retailers are, as it relates to foreign exchange, how does one think about pricing? I don't have any specific comment on that. But you would appreciate that we're thinking about that.

So just to dimension how VSBA fits into the segment as a whole, there are 4 businesses, reminder, there are 4 businesses within the international segment. So there's the Victoria's Secret full assortment owned stores in the U.K., the full assortment stores into the franchise business, the Bath & Body Works international business and the franchise arrangement, and there's VSBA. Three of those 4 businesses have very strong year and very strong quarter. As you rightly point out, our problem in the segment was VSBA. And I'd say there are 3 drivers of that difficulty, as I said, in the preprepared remarks, and they're about in equal measure. One is FX, which impacts both recognized revenue and operating income. The second is a general softness in travel retail, particularly people from Russia, from China and tourist destinations that are related to the Middle East and security pressures there have been effected. And I think there has been written about widely across the travel retail industry. And the third, which we absolutely own and would take responsibility for is weakness in our Victoria's Secret beauty business, particularly related to the Fantasies relaunch. And that affected our business globally. To the questions about how we feel about the fundamentals of the business and store closures, we feel very, very good about VSBA. It's a very profitable business, has a lot of runway ahead of it. It tees up the brand internationally very well for us. And we will continue to increase our footprint in that business. The closures, and I think there will be maybe 10, we're guessing, we can see about 5 right now, and we're positioning that it may be up to 10, come from a number of things. One is, on occasion, we close the VSBA in order to replace it with a VSFA. So to put a big store where a small store was, that's good news. That's a really good thing. Second is the nature of travel retailers. These leases tend to be 3-year leases. So just by normal course of business, some of our stores that are 5 years old or more will be coming up for renewal. And other times they're just relocation. So there's nothing sinister in the closure numbers. We have a lot of confidence in the business and the foundations are strong."

We see a range of all sorts of performances on average. We very much like the performance that's happened, and they continue to be good. And so as we think about 2016, obviously, we've got more stores rolling and our #1 goal is to maintain the comp in the business period and then, obviously, the comp performance that we've seen in those White Barn stores primarily because of the investment that we've made. But yes, we like the results from last year. We like the results currently. And obviously, we'll do what we do really well, which is we'll read and react, and we'll monitor. So we won't just continue to go blindly if things change. But so far, so good."

So we continue to make really good progress in La Senza. We've had a multi-quarter roller coaster comps. Very strong sales performance really driven by being faster to market, more fashion-right, and zeroing in on customer with a young, sexy, obvious, value positioning. And that positioning is what really differentiates it from both PINK and from Victoria. And in markets around the world where we see the 3 lingerie brands present, we know that they trade effectively alongside each other. They appeal to different customers. And where they appeal to the same customer in different shopping modes and different moods, it's all good. So yes, we're excited to bring La Senza to the U.S. We'll open probably 5 stores in the fall. The first store is opening in November. Not particular material in terms of the CapEx as those stores are only 2,000 square feet in space, no particular material in terms of preopening costs, but very significant in terms of the future growth opportunity that, that represents. We won't get too far of ourselves in claiming victory. It's just a test, and we'll call it over the holiday period, and we'll report back in January. But certainly, very exciting progress for the brand."

In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: Sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are",2101,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: Sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strength of our brands and our differentiation, and a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals.
While we manage the business conservatively, we utilize speed to chase back into what was working and maximize our opportunities. We improved our full year operating margin by 90 basis points to 18% and we grew operating income dollars by 12%. We also continue to return substantial value to shareholders. We increased our annual dividend by 20% to $2.40 per share. We declared a special dividend of $2 per share and authorized a new 500 million share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to 2016, we're optimistic and confident in our opportunities for growth. As you know, we manage the business conservatively with respect to inventory and expenses to protect against any potential downside. Reflecting this mindset, the high end of our full year guidance implies a conservative view at mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income dollars and a decline in the operating income rate. We would not be satisfied with that outcome, and we will continue to leverage speed to chase back into what's working and deliver upside to our forecast.
We remain committed to our goal of 10% or better annual growth and operating income dollars and an operating income rate in the high-teens. Looking at the fourth quarter performance in more detail, as described on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 8% to $4.395 billion and comps increased 6% on top of 6% last year. The gross margin rate increased 50 basis points to 45.6%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A expense leveraged by 60 basis points. The operating income rate increased by 100 basis points to 24.5% and operating income dollars increased 13% to $1.078 billion.
The tax rate in the quarter of 35.2% provided $0.08 of upside to our initial guidance. Earnings per share increased 14% to $2.15 versus $1.89 last year. Foreign currency had a negative impact of about $0.05 to 2015 fourth quarter EPS.
Turning to our full year results on Page 5. Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.99 versus $3.50 last year. FX negatively impacted full year 2015 results by about $0.13. Net sales increased 6% to $12.154 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. The gross margin rate increased 80 basis points to 42.8%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate leveraged by 10 basis points.
Page 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 18%, up 90 basis points to last year. Operating income dollars increased $238.4 million or 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business segments.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 4% versus last year, down 6% on a 2-year basis. Inventories are clean and well positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square-foot up in the mid-single-digit range. 
Operating cash flow in 2015 was $1.869 billion, free cash flow was $1.142 billion and capital expenditures were $727 million. We repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock in 2015 for $483 million. 
Our 2016 forecast, as detailed on Page 11, reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret, in Bath & Body Works real estate, including a new Victoria's Secret flagship store on Fifth Avenue. Increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, incremental interest expense related to last October's note issuance and a higher tax rate.
Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a 2% to 4% comp increase, including an updated February comp of up mid-single digits at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. To be clear, the store-only comp is expected to be up mid-single digits at both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The earlier Easter this year will negatively impact March comps and positively impact April.
As noted in our press release, beginning with our February sales release, we will include direct sales with reported comps consistent with industry practice. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be down to last year driven by some decline in the merchandise margin rate, primarily driven by foreign exchange and buying and occupancy deleverage. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs. We expect interest and other nonoperating expense in the first quarter to be about $100 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.61 result. This forecast includes a total negative impact of about $0.08 related to foreign currency, incremental interest expense and preopening cost for the flagship Fifth Avenue Victoria's Secret store.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 to 2 points higher than comps due to growth in square footage. Foreign currency translation is expected to have a slight negative impact to total sales growth. 
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be down to last year, driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy deleverage. The merchandise margin rate decline is driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency. Excluding this, we expect the merchandise margin rate to be about flat. 
We expect the full year SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $390 million, about $0.12 a share higher than last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37% versus 36.2% in 2015. The higher projected tax rate in 2016 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.05. 
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 292 million in the first quarter and the full year. The lower share count will benefit earnings per share year-over-year by about $0.08. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be between $3.90 and $4.10. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10. We're projecting 2016 CapEx between $900 million and $1 billion. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. 
As detailed on Page 13 in the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 13 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 5%, driven by 27 net new openings and 145 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 4%. Our increased investment in real estate will result in high single-digit percentage increase in buying and occupancy expense in 2016, about 3 points higher than growth in 2015.
The Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue store will drive incremental expense related to preopening cost of about $30 million. Bath & Body Works will also see more pressure from buying and occupancy cost as a result of our investment in Bath & Body Works and White Barn remodels. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2016 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient under our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Turning to Victoria's Secret. I'd like to express our appreciation to Sharen for her leadership and all that she accomplished in her 16 years with the business. Victoria's Secret is well positioned for growth. We have a strong brand, great momentum and a highly talented team that is capable of leading the brand to continued success. Now turning to results. 
The Victoria's Secret segment had a strong fourth quarter, growing both sales and earnings to record levels. Total sales increased 9% to $2.6 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. Operating income increased $84 million or 17% to $593.6 million, and our operating income rate increased 150 basis points to 22.7%. 
Our focus on reading and reacting with speed and agility positioned us to get back into trends more quickly and drove mid-teen growth in bras, high single-digit growth in panties and low 20s growth in PINK loungewear. Specific to the key holiday time period in the quarter, we delivered record results both Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. We continue to reposition our beauty category to be more consistent with the Victoria's Secret brand. Results for the business were down to last year as expected.
Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year driven by strength in both stores and direct. The rate was about flat to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year in line with expectations, driven by planned investments in PINK and additional beauty inventory to support the Fantasies restage. 
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance starting with stores. 
We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance as sales and operating income increased to record levels on top of record levels last year. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2 billion and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. We were pleased with the customer response to our holiday storytelling, which linked a consistent theme across all our customer touch points. We also added an incremental bra launch in December, which is successful in driving newness and holiday right product for gifting and self purchase. As a result, we had strong sales growth across our key businesses, bras, panties, sleepwear and PINK loungewear. 
Merchandise margin dollars also increased versus last year. Merchandise margin rate was about flat, as full-price selling strength in PINK was offset by a planned sport event in January, declines in beauty as we reposition this category and an unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A rates leveraged in the quarter as we remain focused on disciplined expense management. For the quarter, operating income dollars and rate both increased.
Now turning to the direct channel. Strong performance during the holiday period drove record sales and operating income results in the direct channel. Fourth quarter sales increased 15% to $567 million, driven by strength across the assortment. Bras, panties, sleep, PINK and sport all experienced double-digit growth to last year. We fully anniversary-ed last year's exit from apparel during the fourth quarter. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly driven by the sales increase, margin rate expansion and expense leverage.
Turning to our full year results. Total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 6% to $7.7 billion. Operating income increased by $119 million to $1.4 billion. And the operating income rate improved by 50 basis points to 18.1%. In the store channel, comps increased 5% with total store channel sales up 7%. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year with rate about flat. Total expenses leveraged versus last year. As a result, operating income dollars increased versus last year and the rate was about flat.
In the direct channel, sales increased 3% as 16% growth in go-forward categories more than offset the exit of non-go-forward apparel sales last year. The merchandise margin rate increased driven by the category mix benefit from the apparel exit and expenses leveraged. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were up significantly.
Looking ahead to 2016. We will plan the business conservatively while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react. We will continue to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create an even better shopping experience for our customers. 
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter, building on record fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive solid growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 8% or $116 million to last year. Comps increased 6% and our direct channel sales grew by 24%. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses, our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and bathroom fragrance assortment. 
Our concept of the Perfect Christmas resonated well with our customers, and we were pleased with the acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of the stores and the in-store execution of our plans. The momentum from holiday continued with a solid semiannual sale performance that builds on last year's strong sales results. Promotional activity for the quarter was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that included fewer, but more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers.
For the quarter, operating income was $487 million, up 8% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 10 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by increase in buying and occupancy expense as we continue our store investment program. Operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by continued unfavorable foreign exchange pressure in our Canadian business. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year, and annual sales were over $360 million.
For fiscal 2015, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps increased 5%. Operating income was $858 million, up 16% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 190 basis points to 23.9%, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate and expense leverage. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor customer preferences and leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities, allowing us to put the right product for full-price selling in front of our customers at the right time. 
We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our Let's go to Italy theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. Our inventories are well positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customer's preferences. 
We remain focused on making the appropriate investments in our business, including the necessary increases in occupancy costs in order to continue our White Barn and Bath & Body Works remodel and expansion program. We've been pleased with the results to date of our White Barn format. We ended 2015 with 67 of our stores in the format containing White Barn. Of the 27 net openings and 145 remodels that Stuart mentioned in his remarks, we will -- all will contain our White Barn concept either in the side-by-side or a shop-in-shop format. 
And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

We continue to be very confident about our opportunity for growth internationally. Our brands are well received wherever we open around the world, and our execution has been excellent. Our foundation is very solid",500,"Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We continue to be very confident about our opportunity for growth internationally. Our brands are well received wherever we open around the world, and our execution has been excellent. Our foundation is very solid. 
We saw a strong growth in retail sales on a constant currency basis across all of our formats in the fourth quarter. However, not all of this growth translated into recognized revenue. Fourth quarter recognized revenue in the international segment increased by 6% and operating income declined by $1.4 million to $28 million. Foreign currency had about a 5 point impact on our recorded revenue growth and about a $3 million negative impact to operating income.
We had very solid growth in both recognized revenue and operating income in our company-owned stores in the U.K., in our franchise full assortment stores and in our Bath & Body Works stores. However, the VSBA business experienced a significant decline in both revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter.
This decline was primarily the result of foreign currency translation, softness in travel retail and tourism generally and a decline in shipments of beauty products in anticipation of the new Victoria's Secret Fantasies collection being launched in the spring. 
In the full year 2015, the international segment revenue increased by 15% to $385.2 million and operating income increased by 13% to $87.9 million. FX negatively impacted 2015 operating income by about $15 million. So absent the FX impact, operating income would have increased 32% and the rates would have increased by 200 basis points to 25.2%. We opened 144 new stores in 2015 to end the year with 531 stores in the international segment, and we plan to open about 175 stores in 2016.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. Our London flagship store on Bond Street as well as our 13 mall stores are operating very well, and we'll open another 5 stores in the U.K. this year. 
In the Middle East, we now have 16 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 3 PINK stores open under our partnership with Alshaya. These stores continue to do well and will open another 12 or so full assortment stores this year, including in new geographies such as China, Mexico, Singapore and earlier this month, in Russia. We'll also open about 5 more PINK stores. 
In the VSBA business, we ended the year with 373 locations, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We'll open another 90 or so across the globe in 2016. In Bath & Body Works, we now have 125 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships, and we continue to be very pleased with performance of these stores and expect to open another 65 or so BBW stores in the year ahead.
So in summary, despite headwinds from foreign exchange, we made significant progress internationally in 2015, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, which is great execution of our brands wherever we go."

So the B&O deleverage is the bigger part, to answer your question. The fact that we're building a global flagship on Fifth Avenue, we view as a very positive thing. And it certainly puts some short-term pressure in the P&L. But for our business, over the long term, it's a terrific thing. It's going to be a great store. And again, the opportunity to remodel Bath & Body and include White Barn in those remodels is also a very good thing, but it puts some short-term pressure on the P&L."

But there will be year-to-year variation in the number of freestanding PINKs versus growth through remodels. That again is a function of mall-by-mall circumstances that are in front of us.

So just to dimension how VSBA fits into the segment as a whole, there are 4 businesses, reminder, there are 4 businesses within the international segment. So there's the Victoria's Secret full assortment owned stores in the U.K., the full assortment stores into the franchise business, the Bath & Body Works international business and the franchise arrangements, and there's VSBA. 3 of those 4 businesses have very strong year and very strong quarter. As you rightly point out, our problem in the segment was VSBA. And I'd say there are 3 drivers of that difficulty, as I said in the preprepared remarks, and they're about in equal measure. One is FX, which impacts both recognized revenue and operating income. The second is a general softness in travel retail, particularly people from Russia, from China and tourist destinations that are related to the Middle East and security pressures there have been affected. And I think the -- has been written about widely across the travel retail industry. And the third, which we absolutely own and would take responsibility for, is weakness in our Victoria's Secret beauty business, particularly related to the Fantasies relaunch. And that affected our business globally. To the questions about how we feel about the fundamentals of the business and store closures, we feel very, very good about VSBA. It's a very profitable business, has a lot of runway ahead of it. It tees up the brand internationally very well for us. And we will continue to increase our footprint in that business. The closures, and I think there will be maybe 10, we're guessing, we can see about 5 right now, and we're positioning that it may be up to 10, come from a number of things. One is, on occasion, we close the VSBA in order to replace it with a VSFA. So to put a big store where a small store was, that's good news. That's a really good thing. Second is the nature of travel retailers. These leases tend to be 3-year leases. So just by normal course of business, some of our stores that are 5 years old or more will be coming up for renewal. And other times they're just relocations. So there's nothing sinister in the closure numbers. We have a lot of confidence in the business and the foundations are strong."

But with that said, speed has been leveraged in the lingerie business generally and in the beauty business. But Roxanne, in answer to your question, where is the biggest opportunity, it's on the beauty side of the business in terms of getting faster. And there's work happening to get after that opportunity. But PINK is very fast. Lingerie has made substantial progress and is also very fast, and inherently, a little more complicated given the more complicated construction of its bras and things like that versus the PINK assortment. So lingerie has also made very good progress. And to be clear, I think the biggest opportunity -- we think the biggest opportunity in speed at Victoria's is in the beauty side of the business."

If I help to interpret that, the biggest area of growth for us in 2016 will be in the full assortment business. So we will have our biggest year of store openings ever by some distance.

So as I mentioned, we have Russia that already opened earlier this month. We have Mexico coming. We have China. We have Singapore. We're actively looking at real estate in lots of other geographies as well. So I think you'll see a real ramp-up in the full assortment store participation of the business. How you model for that, I recognize it's tricky. You've got 4 businesses and you've got 3 different models owned, royalty and wholesale. It's difficult to do.

Although we delivered first quarter results above our initial expectations, we were not satisfied with our overall results as adjusted operating income declined 4% compared to last year, primarily driven by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
We had a range of performance across the company in the first quarter with PINK and Bath & Body Works delivering strong results and weaker performance at Victoria's Secret lingerie and beauty. 
From a macro perspective, we did experience a deceleration in trend through the quarter, but we are focused on what we can control, and we have opportunities to improve our execution. It's important to note that we have made significant changes in the last couple of months at Victoria's Secret, making organizational and leadership changes, exiting merchandise categories, exiting nearly 300 people from the business and changing our promotional strategy. We're making these changes proactively from a position of strength and following a record fourth quarter and 2015 for the brand.
Our revised outlook for 2016 reflects the impact of the actions at Victoria's Secret, as well as incremental cost related to our plan to develop China as a company owned business. Our brands are strong, and we're energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to maximize profitability.

So I think the only comments I would add from the notes that went out last night is spent a fair amount of time in the stores over the course of the past few weeks, so I'll comment on those observations. 
I think, firstly, we remain pleased with the traffic and the energy that we're seeing in the stores. Secondly, we have been keeping customers pretty engaged through the newness and the compelling stories that we're telling, which is really important for us us when you think about the destination brands. So we really need to continue to keep her engaged. 
Thirdly, for the most part, pretty pleased with customer's response to products and assortments and our collections. I think we can do better, but pretty happy from that perspective. As it relates to speed, really pleased with our ability to have been able to leverage the speed model into our ability to chase in the home business, and that's been important for us, not only because it's the most difficult business to chase into, but also because it's still a very, very healthy business for us. 
We're pretty pleased in terms of what we're seeing from the real estate investment and the type of returns we're getting there. So again, we're relatively pleased with what's happening then we'll continue to monitor that and read-and-react as we would. And then, finally, as we see the marketplace remains pretty dynamic, we'll continue to leverage on those important discipline, which is really the motion of staying as close as we can to the customer and then reading and reacting to her behavior.

I mean, in the rationale, first of all, for the category exits is to focus our energy at all levels of the business, our resources at all levels of our business and our most significant core categories, bras, panties, beauty in the Victoria's Secret business. And we made a conclusion, came to a conclusion that this one business was not one of those core categories, that it had been a flattish business for the last several years, many years. And we're putting our energy against those core categories to accelerate growth in bras, panties and beauty. It is going to put some pressure on the business, along with some of the promotional changes that we're making, less direct mail couponing, et cetera. But as you outlined in your question, we have some expense savings to that we've action as well including the elimination of the catalogs spent in a meaningful reduction in our home, office overhead, which in part, offsets the sales and profit pressure from the category exits and the impact of the promotional changes that we're implementing. But at the end of the day, as outlined in our commentary that we sent out last night and the brief remarks we made this morning, we're making these changes from a position of strength to accelerate growth in these core categories. And there'll be some short-term financial pressure, as outlined in our guidance, both for Q2 and the full year, but we'll then work hard to beat that guidance, as you would imagine. and we're absolutely confident that these changes are the right thing to do for the long-term health of Victoria's Secret, and again, to accelerate growth in that business."

One of the things I love about working for our company and less this point of view more significantly, but the leadership team, our point of view is that while we reset guidance, and I'm not altering that guidance in mindset, this isn't the reset year at all. So we're going to have some challenge in the near term, and we've done our best to outline that in our guidance. But I'll tell you, starting at the top and with some acknowledgment of short-term pressure, we're going to work very hard to exceed that guidance and in no way do we have in our mind that 2016 is a kind of reset year with no growth. Again, the guidance is the guidance. But you should know and known us for a long time, our mindset is we're going to work very hard to drive great expenses for customers, very strong sales growth and resulting profit growth. So I'm glad you asked the question. And obviously, from that, expecting a very good 2016 after some short-term pressure. Again, the guidance is the guidance. And then certainly expect a very, very good 2017. So good question. With a respect to line to the traffic generated from direct mail couponing, we're working hard to replace that volume in that profit. And again, ewr doing it for reasons that I think you appreciate from our earlier remarks in terms of getting promotion that drives trial and key categories. And at the end of the day, it's healthier. We believe for the business. But in the short term, it's challenged, but we're doing a lot of things in terms of tests and rolling different ideas to ensure that we have healthy traffic and good sales results. And that will be a week-to-week, month-to-month exercise, but it's being very actively worked on Mondays and Tuesdays every week and with good test and learning and adjustment. Again, a other thing I really enjoy about the company in respect about the company is that we test, we read, we react, we were agile in our thinking and in our execution.

We think that's an important change in organization that will simplify and focus the business on those 3 broad categories. In terms of guidepost or our objectives, the purpose of all of that is to ensure that we're focused and to accelerate growth in core categories. Obviously, PINK has been our strongest performing business over the last several years and that sales trend, that sales performance has continued in 2016. Beauty has been the weakest of the 3 businesses. And as we shared in our commentary, a new leader joining the business at the beginning of this month. And it will take some time. A logical question we get asked understandably within and outside the business is how long will it take to substantially improve the trend of that business. And it is a bit longer in time and cycle and approach development activities than some of our other categories. But with new leadership and again, a focus through the organizational changes I mentioned, certainly optimistic that we'll see an improvement in trend there. And then the Lingerie business, the core of the core in terms of bras and panties, a new leader coming in at the beginning of September with various substantial experience and an existing strong leadership team. So an additional resource in leadership, leader coming into strengthen that team. But coming from a good base and again, optimistic through these changes that it will accelerate growth. In all of the measures, whether it's customer satisfaction, sales growth, margin improvement, inventory turn, those are all the things that we'll be driving towards."

Separately, and I think importantly for the whole business, in the fourth quarter 2015, we reduced our catalog activity by nominally 40%. And demand in the direct channel was up, if I remember right, about 15%. So both based on 2 markets that we tested in and significant reduction in activity in our fourth quarter last year for the whole business, it made us confident that while there might be some sales pressures certainly, from an operating income standpoint, meaning, did it pay for itself on an OI business, we felt that this was an appropriate change to make in our business. Importantly, one of the things that we try to do is we say if you were starting this business today in current context, 2016, would you start with one of your major ideas being a catalog, a paper-based catalog sent through the mail as one of your key, if not your key marketing activity for a global brand. And as we thought about it in that way, along with the numerical test and financial valuation, very comfortable with the change that we've made. Separately, with respect to your second question on sales guidance and the reduction in comp guidance, I'm glad you asked it. It's important to know that as we outlined in our overall remarks, that we have our range of performance in our business. So in terms of the sales reduction, we haven't changed our assumptions about Bath & Body Works at all. Bath & Body Works grew operating income 15% in the first quarter. There will be some occupancy pressure in that business in the latter half of the year in connection with the remodel activity for the White Barn and Bath & Body remodels. But Bath & Body is running a very good business. As we also outlined, the PINK business, very strong. So I wouldn't want outside analysts or investors to think that L Brands, as a broad-based concerned about sales trends, we actually have important parts of our business, most notably Bath & Body Works and PINK, that are doing very, very well. And we've got some pressure in other parts of our business in part due to changes to that we're making in terms of category exits and a reduction in promotional activity. But some weakness in the beauty business that we've been experiencing now for some time. So a range of performance. Overall, yes, we've taken our numbers down, but it's on -- it's due to very specific things and only certain portions of our business. Thank you."

So in terms of what the Victoria's Secret business looks like in aggregate and by major component 5 years from now. Know that as a mindset and in terms of goals so that we aspire to in our business in many periods we accomplished, we're looking to grow the top line sales in major parts of our business in -- on the low side at 5% per year. And on the high side, when we're really doing well, 10% or 15% per year. So in terms of what are we trying to get done top line wise over the next 5 years, it would be growth ranging from 5% to 15%, depending upon category and frankly, how well we execute. In terms of the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret business, this is one of the best brands in the world. And from that brand, equity, emotional content, leadership position, when we execute really well, with have pricing power. If we deliver emotion, great customer experiences, differentiated from competition. That creates pricing power, which ultimately grades productivity and margin. And so with that belief, and we've got to work hard to continue that leadership position. We believe the operating income rate for Victoria's Secret should absolutely be high-teens, if not 20%, when we think about our own history and the best in the world. So hopefully that gives you some sense of our thinking and what our goals are over the next 5 years. In terms of the exits and their seasonality, the -- we will sell through the swim that we have at the swimsuit business that we have in stores in the spring season. And to the extent that we have some swim inventory remaining after spring, we'll sell that through the fall season 2016 in the direct channel. That's our current thinking in our current plan. With respect to the apparel exit. Again, that's mostly or totally, I should say, in the direct channel. And we'll sell that both in the spring season, and to some extent, into the fall season. So we're looking to particularly in the store side of the business, move through the inventory. This is about swim at pretty reasonable pace to simplify store level execution. And frankly, to free up space for other categories, like core bras and sport and other things. But we won't be as urgent the respect to the same in non-go-forward apparel exit indirect because it doesn't great in the same kind of complexity from an operational standpoint in that channel. So in terms of dollarizing that by quarter, it's going to be more dynamic. But hopefully, that's helpful to you in an overall modeling sense."

And what we're doing now, as I think you appreciate is we are looking to replace that activity, which was -- we call that customer relationship management. What it really was couponing through the mail in many respects. And we're looking to substitute that with various category level promotions in particular that drive trial of key categories. That activity and the results from that new activity are being evaluated every week. And so that will be dynamic. And while the nature of the offers that we utilize through direct mail, which most typically were a free panty and $10 off a bra, we've concluded that, A, we've been running that for a long time. B, a lot of customers came in and got their free panty and didn't buy anything else. And so we think there's a clever way, a smarter way to drive traffic that's helped -- more healthy for the brand. The details of that are being literally worked every week, including test of key promotional ideas in the business. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of it.

Although we delivered first quarter results above our initial expectations, we were not satisfied with our overall results as adjusted operating income declined 4% compared to last year, primarily driven by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
We had a range of performance across the company in the first quarter with PINK and Bath & Body Works delivering strong results and weaker performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and Beauty. 
From a macro perspective, we did experience a deceleration in trend through the quarter, but we are focused on what we can control, and we have opportunities to improve our execution. It's important to note that we have made significant changes in the last couple of months at Victoria's Secret, making organizational and leadership changes, exiting merchandise categories, exiting nearly 300 people from the business and changing our promotional strategy. We're making these changes proactively from a position of strength and following a record fourth quarter and 2015 for the brand.
Our revised outlook for 2016 reflects the impact of the actions at Victoria's Secret as well as incremental cost related to our plan to develop China as a company-owned business. Our brands are strong, and we're energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to maximize profitability. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

I think, firstly, we remain pleased with the traffic and the energy that we're seeing in the stores. Secondly, we have been keeping customers pretty engaged through the newness and the compelling stories that we're telling, which is really important for us when you think about the destination brands. So we really need to continue to keep her engaged. 
Thirdly, for the most part, pretty pleased with customers' response to products and assortments and our collections. I think we can do better, but pretty happy from that perspective. As it relates to speed, really pleased with our ability to have been able to leverage the speed model into our ability to chase in the home business, and that's been important for us, not only because it's the most difficult business to chase into, but also because it's still a very, very healthy business for us. 
We're pretty pleased in terms of what we're seeing from the real estate investments and the type of return that we're getting there. So again, we're relatively pleased with what's happening then we'll continue to monitor that and read and react as we would. And then, finally, as we see the marketplace remains pretty dynamic, we'll continue to leverage on those important discipline, which is really the motion of staying as close as we can to the customer and then reading and reacting to her behavior.

And we made a conclusion -- came to a conclusion that this one business was not one of those core categories that it had been a flattish business for the last several years, many years. And we're putting our energy against those core categories to accelerate growth in bras, panties and beauty. It is going to put some pressure on the business, along with some of the promotional changes that we're making, less direct mail couponing, et cetera. But as you outlined in your question, we have some expense savings to that we've action as well including the elimination of the catalogs spend and a meaningful reduction in our home, office overhead, which, in part, offsets the sales and profit pressure from the category exits and the impact of the promotional changes that we're implementing. But at the end of the day, as outlined in our commentary that we sent out last night and the brief remarks we made this morning, we're making these changes from a position of strength to accelerate growth in these core categories. And there'll be some short-term financial pressure, as outlined in our guidance, both for Q2 and the full year. But we'll then work hard to beat that guidance, as you would imagine, and we're absolutely confident that these changes are the right thing to do for the long-term health of Victoria's Secret, and again, to accelerate growth in that business."

One of the things I love about working for our company and less this point of view most significantly, but the leadership team. Our point of view is that while we reset guidance and I'm not altering that guidance in mindset, this isn't the reset year at all. So we're going to have some challenge in the near term, and we've done our best to outline that in our guidance. But I'll tell you, starting at the top and with some acknowledgment of short-term pressure, we're going to work very hard to exceed that guidance and in no way do we have in our mind that 2016 is a kind of a reset year with no growth. Again, the guidance is the guidance. But you should know and known us for a long time, our mindset is we're going to work very hard to drive great experiences for customers, very strong sales growth and resulting profit growth. So I'm glad you asked the question. And obviously, from that, expecting a very good 2016 after some short-term pressure. Again, the guidance is the guidance. And then certainly expect a very, very good 2017. So good question. With respect, Brian, to the traffic generated from direct mail couponing, we're working hard to replace that volume in that profit. And again, we're doing it for reasons that I think you appreciate from our earlier remarks in terms of do add promotion that drives trial and key categories. And at the end of the day, it's healthier, we believe, for the business. But in the short term, it's challenged, but we're doing a lot of things in terms of tests and rolling different ideas to ensure that we have healthy traffic and good sales results. And that will be a week-to-week, month-to-month exercise, but it's being very actively worked on Mondays and Tuesdays every week and with good test and learning and adjustment. Again, another thing I really enjoy about the company in respect about the company is that we test, we read, we react, we were agile in our thinking and in our execution. And it's more dynamic right now than typical, no doubt about that. But I'm confident that we'll read and react and adjust appropriately."

We think that's an important change in organization that will simplify and focus the business on those 3 broad categories. In terms of guidepost or our objectives, the purpose of all of that is to ensure that we're focused and to accelerate growth in core categories. Obviously, PINK has been our strongest performing business over the last several years, and that sales trend, that sales performance has continued in 2016. Beauty has been the weakest of the 3 businesses. And as we shared in our commentary, a new leader joining the business at the beginning of this month. And it will take some time. A logical question we get asked understandably within and outside the business is how long will it take to substantially improve the trend of that business. And it is a bit longer in lead time and cycle and approach development activities than some of our other categories. But with new leadership and again, the focus through the organizational changes I mentioned, certainly optimistic that we'll see an improvement in trend there. And then the Lingerie business, the core of the core in terms of bras and panties, a new leader coming in at the beginning of September with various substantial experience and an existing strong leadership team. So an additional resource in leadership -- leader coming in to strengthen that team. But coming from a good base and again, optimistic through these changes that it will accelerate growth.

We've been very engaged in the last 12 months with our partner, they've done a terrific job. Really, they did a great job in standing up some 26 VSBA stores. But as we look forward and we think about the sheer scale and opportunity of the market and we combine that with the complexity, the intrinsic complexity that there is in China, particularly around regulatory affairs around how we build our stores, how we operate those stores, it seems to me that we're going to be doing most of the heavy lifting anyway. It makes sense that we should be in it completely. So when can you expect that it should start to make the next contribution? Well, the sales contribution will start at the very end of this year. From a profit point of view, I don't really know. Our experience in the U.K. is that it takes 2 to 3 years to get a business from the investments face -- that the profits will face, and it really depends on the amount of time that we take to build it. Our goal here is to be in it for the very long term rather than to take short-term gains. I hope that gives you some insight."

So with respect to catalog, we did test the elimination of catalog into significant markets for a year and saw a relatively small to no impact on sales. And if one does simple math on it, you need to get a lot of sales or meaningful amount of sales to pay for the catalog. In round numbers, we were spending $125 million to $150 million a year on the catalog. And we ran it again for a year into significant markets and didn't see a significant change in sales. Separately and I think importantly for the whole business in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reduced our catalog activity by nominally 40%. And demand in the direct channel was up, if I remember right, about 15%. So both based on 2 markets that we tested in and significant reduction in activity in our fourth quarter last year for the whole business. It made us confident that while there might be some sales pressure, certainly from an operating income standpoint, meaning did it pay for itself. On an OI basis, we felt that this was an appropriate change to make in our business. Importantly, one of the things that we try to do is we say if we were starting this business today in current context 2016, would you start with one of your major ideas being a catalog, a paper-based catalog sent through the mail as one of your key, if not your key marketing activity for a global brand. And as we thought about it in that way, along with the numerical test and financial evaluation, very comfortable with the change that we've made. Separately, with respect to your second question on sales guidance and the reduction in comp guidance, I'm glad you asked it. It's important to know that as we outlined in our overall remarks, that we have our range of performance in our business. So in terms of the sales reduction, we haven't changed our assumptions about Bath & Body Works at all. Bath & Body Works grew operating income 15% in the first quarter. There will be some occupancy pressure in that business in the latter half of the year in connection with the remodel activity for the White Barn and Bath & Body remodels, but Bath & Body is running a very good business. As we also outlined, the PINK business, very strong. So I wouldn't want outside analysts or investors to think that L Brands as a broad-based concerned about sales trends. We actually have important parts of our business, most notably Bath & Body Works and PINK that are doing very, very well. And we've got some pressure in other parts of our business in part due to changes that we're making in terms of category exits and reduction in promotional activity, but some weakness in the Beauty business that we've been experiencing now for some time. So a range of performance. Overall, yes, we've taken our numbers down, but it's on -- it's due to very specific things and only certain portions of our business. Thank you."

So in terms of what the Victoria's Secret business looks like in aggregate and by major component 5 years from now as a mindset and in terms of goals that we aspire to in our business in many periods we accomplished, we're looking to grow the top line sales in major parts of our business in -- on the low side at 5% per year and on the high side, when we're really doing well, 10% or 15% per year. So in terms of what are we trying to get done top line-wise over the next 5 years, it would be growth ranging from 5% to 15%, depending upon category and frankly, how well we execute. In terms of the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret business, this is one of the best brands in the world. And from that brand, equity, emotional content, leadership position, when we execute really well, we have pricing power. We deliver emotion, great customer experiences, differentiated from competition, and that creates pricing power, which ultimately creates productivity and margin. And so with that belief and we've got to work hard to continue that leadership position. We believe the operating income rate for Victoria's Secret should absolutely be high-teens, if not 20% when we think about our own history and the best in the world. So hopefully that gives you some sense of our thinking and what our goals are over the next 5 years. In terms of the exits and their seasonality, the -- we will sell through the swim that we have at the swimsuit business that we have in stores in the spring season. And to the extent that we have some swim inventory remaining after spring, we'll sell that through the fall season 2016 in the direct channel. That's our current thinking in our current plan. With respect to the apparel exit, again, that's mostly or totally, I should say, in the direct channel. And we'll sell that both in the spring season and to some extent, into the fall season. So we're looking to particularly in the store side of the business, move through the inventory. This is about swim at pretty reasonable pace to simplify store level execution. And frankly, to free up space for other categories, like core bras and sport and other things, but we won't be as urgent with respect to the swim and non-go-forward apparel exit indirect because it doesn't create the same kind of complexity from an operational standpoint in that channel. So in terms of dollarizing that by quarter, it's going to be more dynamic. But hopefully, that's helpful to you in an overall modeling sense."

And we're looking to substitute that with various category level promotions in particular that drive trial of key categories. That activity and the results from that new activity are being evaluated every week. And so that will be dynamic. And while the nature of the offers that we utilize through direct mail, which most typically were a free panty and $10 off a bra, we've concluded that, A, we've been running that for a long time; B, a lot of customers came in and got their free panty and didn't buy anything else.

Although we delivered first quarter results above our initial expectations, we were not satisfied with our overall results as adjusted operating income declined 4% compared to last year, primarily driven by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
We had a range of performance across the company in the first quarter with PINK and Bath & Body Works delivering strong results and weaker performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and Beauty. 
From a macro perspective, we did experience a deceleration in trend through the quarter, but we are focused on what we can control, and we have opportunities to improve our execution. It's important to note that we have made significant changes in the last couple of months at Victoria's Secret, making organizational and leadership changes, exiting merchandise categories, exiting nearly 300 people from the business and changing our promotional strategy. We're making these changes proactively from a position of strength and following a record fourth quarter and 2015 for the brand.
Our revised outlook for 2016 reflects the impact of the actions at Victoria's Secret as well as incremental cost related to our plan to develop China as a company-owned business. Our brands are strong, and we're energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to maximize profitability. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

I think, firstly, we remain pleased with the traffic and the energy that we're seeing in the stores. Secondly, we appear to be keeping customers pretty engaged through the newness and the compelling stories that we're telling, which is really important for us when you think about the destination brands. So we really need to continue to keep her engaged. 
Thirdly, for the most part, pretty pleased with customers' response to products and assortments and our collections. I think we can do better, but pretty happy from that perspective. As it relates to speed, really pleased with our ability to have been able to leverage the speed model into our ability to chase in the home business, and that's been important for us, not only because it's the most difficult business to chase into, but also because it's still a very, very healthy business for us. 
We're pretty pleased in terms of what we're seeing from the real estate investments and the type of return that we're getting there. So again, we're relatively pleased with what's happening then we'll continue to monitor that and read and react as we would. And then, finally, as we see the marketplace remains pretty dynamic, we'll continue to leverage our most important discipline, which is really the notion of staying as close as we can to the customer and then reading and reacting to her behavior.

And we're putting our energy against those core categories to accelerate growth in bras, panties and beauty. It is going to put some pressure on the business, along with some of the promotional changes that we're making, less direct mail couponing, et cetera. But as you outlined in your question, we have some expense savings that we've actioned as well including the elimination of the catalog spend and a meaningful reduction in our home, office overhead, which, in part, offsets the sales and profit pressure from the category exits and the impact of the promotional changes that we're implementing. But at the end of the day, as outlined in our commentary that we sent out last night and the brief remarks we made this morning, we're making these changes from a position of strength to accelerate growth in these core categories. And there'll be some short-term financial pressure, as outlined in our guidance, both for Q2 and the full year. But we'll then work hard to beat that guidance, as you would imagine, and we're absolutely confident that these changes are the right thing to do for the long-term health of Victoria's Secret, and again, to accelerate growth in that business."

One of the things I love about working for our company and Les's point of view most significantly, but the leadership team, our point of view, is that while we've reset guidance and I'm not altering that guidance in mindset, this isn't a reset year at all. So we're going to have some challenge in the near term, and we've done our best to outline that in our guidance. But I'll tell you, starting at the top and with some acknowledgment of short-term pressure, we're going to work very hard to exceed that guidance and in no way do we have in our mind that 2016 is a kind of a reset year with no growth. Again, the guidance is the guidance. But you should know and known us for a long time, our mindset is we're going to work very hard to drive great experiences for customers, very strong sales growth and resulting profit growth. So I'm glad you asked the question. And obviously, from that, expecting a very good 2016 after some short-term pressure. Again, the guidance is the guidance. And then certainly expect a very, very good 2017. So good question. With respect, Brian, to the traffic generated from direct mail couponing, we're working hard to replace that volume and that profit. And again, we're doing it for reasons that I think you appreciate from our earlier remarks in terms of doing promotion that drives trial in key categories. And at the end of the day is healthier, we believe, for the business. But in the short term, it's challenged, but we're doing a lot of things in terms of tests and rolling different ideas to ensure that we have healthy traffic and good sales results. And that will be a week-to-week, month-to-month exercise, but it's being very actively worked on Mondays and Tuesdays every week and with good test and learning and adjustment. Again, another thing I really enjoy about the company and respect about the company is that we test, we read, we react, we are agile in our thinking and in our execution. And it's more dynamic right now than typical, no doubt about that. But I'm confident that we'll read and react and adjust appropriately."

So our thinking about inventory and inventory discipline hasn't changed, and I'm not saying that because it's convenient. It just hasn't changed. With that said, we are experiencing some short-term sales pressure for the reasons described in the context of sales. So Kimberly, it's going to be up mid-single as we outlined. In terms of any significant pockets of inventory that we're concerned about, I'm not -- we're not. And we're very focused on ending the spring season clean and at the right levels, and that's requiring some pretty intensive energy right now. But it's a discipline, it's very important to us. And while mid-single is a little ahead of sales, certainly not dramatically ahead of sales, and we're working it actively to get to that result. But again, not intending to have any significant pockets of inventory in the business that we won't have dealt with through the semiannual sale activity as we wrap up this spring season."

We're making important changes to the business. So just again, to step back and -- in an effort to respond to your question, we think that reorganizing the business into 3 units: Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret PINK and Victoria's Secret Beauty, each of which have the stores and direct activity under common leadership for those 3 businesses. We think that's an important change in organization that will simplify and focus the business on those 3 broad categories. In terms of guidepost or objectives, the purpose of all of it is to ensure that we're focused and to accelerate growth in core categories. Obviously, PINK has been our strongest performing business over the last several years, and that sales trend, that sales performance has continued in 2016. Beauty has been the weakest of the 3 businesses. And as we shared in our commentary, a new leader joining the business at the beginning of this month. And it will take some time. A logical question we get asked, understandably, within and outside the business is how long will it take to substantially improve the trend of that business. And it is a bit longer in lead time and cycle and approach development activities than some of our other categories. But with new leadership and again, the focus through the organizational changes I mentioned, certainly optimistic that we'll see an improvement in trend there. And then the Lingerie business, the core of the core in terms of bras and panties, a new leader coming in at the beginning of September with various substantial experience and an existing strong leadership team. So an additional resource in leadership -- leader coming in to strengthen that team. But coming from a good base and again, optimistic through these changes that it will accelerate growth. In all of the measures, whether it's customer satisfaction, sales growth, margin improvement, inventory turn, those are all the things that we'll be driving towards."

It seems to me that we're going to be doing most of the heavy lifting anyway. And it makes sense that we should be in it completely. So when can you expect that it should start to make a contribution? Well, the sales contribution will start at the very end of this year. From a profit point of view, I don't really know. Our experience in the U.K. is that it takes 2 to 3 years to get a business from the investment phase to the profitable phase, and it really depends on the amount of time that we take to build it.

So with respect to catalog, we did test the elimination of catalog into significant markets for a year and saw a relatively small to no impact on sales. And if one does simple math on it, you need to get a lot of sales or meaningful amount of sales to pay for the catalog. In round numbers, we were spending $125 million to $150 million a year on the catalog. And we ran it again for a year in 2 significant markets and didn't see a significant change in sales. Separately and I think importantly for the whole business, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reduced our catalog activity by nominally 40%. And demand in the direct channel was up, if I remember right, about 15%. So both based on 2 markets that we tested in and significant reduction in activity in our fourth quarter last year for the whole business. It made us confident that while there might be some sales pressure, certainly from an operating income standpoint, meaning did it pay for itself, on an OI basis, we felt that this was an appropriate change to make in our business. Importantly, one of the things that we try to do is we say if we were starting this business today in current context 2016, would you start with one of your major ideas being a catalog, a paper-based catalog sent through the mail as one of your key, if not your key marketing activity for a global brand. And as we thought about it in that way, along with the numerical test and financial evaluation, very comfortable with the change that we've made. Separately, with respect to your second question on sales guidance and the reduction in comp guidance, I'm glad you asked. It's important to know that as we outlined in our overall remarks, that we have a range of performance in our business. So in terms of the sales reduction, we haven't changed our assumptions about Bath & Body Works at all. Bath & Body Works grew operating income 15% in the first quarter. There will be some occupancy pressure in that business in the latter half of the year in connection with the remodel activity for the White Barn and Bath & Body remodels, but Bath & Body is running a very good business. As we also outlined, the PINK business, very strong. So I wouldn't want outside analysts or investors to think that L Brands has a broad-based concern about sales trends. We actually have important parts of our business, most notably, Bath & Body Works and PINK that are doing very, very well. And we've got some pressure in other parts of our business in part due to changes that we're making in terms of category exits and reduction in promotional activity, but some weakness in the Beauty business that we've been experiencing now for some time. So a range of performance. Overall, yes, we've taken our numbers down, but it's on -- it's due to very specific things and only certain portions of our business. Thank you."

So in terms of what the Victoria's Secret business looks like in aggregate and by major component 5 years from now, as a mindset and in terms of goals that we aspire to in our business in many periods we accomplished, we're looking to grow the top line sales in major parts of our business in -- on the low side at 5% per year and on the high side, when we're really doing well, 10% or 15% per year. So in terms of what are we trying to get done top line-wise over the next 5 years, it would be growth ranging from 5% to 15%, depending upon category and frankly, how well we execute. In terms of the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret business, this is one of the best brands in the world. And from that brand, equity, emotional content, leadership position, when we execute really well, we have pricing power. We deliver emotion, great customer experiences, differentiated from competition, and that creates pricing power, which ultimately creates productivity and margin. And so with that belief and we've got to work hard to continue that leadership position, we believe the operating income rate for Victoria's Secret should absolutely be high-teens, if not 20% when we think about our own history and the best in the world. So hopefully that gives you some sense of our thinking and what our goals are over the next 5 years. In terms of the exits and their seasonality, the -- we will sell through the swim that we have at the swimsuit business that we have in stores in the spring season. And to the extent that we have some swim inventory remaining after spring, we'll sell that through the fall season 2016 in the direct channel. That's our current thinking and our current plan. With respect to the apparel exit, again, that's mostly or totally, I should say, in the direct channel. And we'll sell that both in the spring season and to some extent, into the fall season. So we're looking to, particularly in the store side of the business, move through the inventory. This is about swim at pretty reasonable pace to simplify store level execution. And frankly, to free up space for other categories, like core bras and sport and other things, but we won't be as urgent with respect to the swim and non-go-forward apparel exit indirect because it doesn't create the same kind of complexity from an operational standpoint in that channel. So in terms of dollarizing that by quarter, it's going to be more dynamic. But hopefully, that's helpful to you in an overall modeling sense."

Meaning, we have pretty good analytics around what we got from that activity historically. And what we're doing now, as I think you appreciate is, we're looking to replace that activity, which was -- we call that customer relationship management. What it really was, was couponing through the mail in many respects. And we're looking to substitute that with various category level promotions in particular that drive trial of key categories. That activity and the results from that new activity are being evaluated every week. And so that will be dynamic. And while the nature of the offers that we utilize through direct mail, which most typically were a free panty and $10 off a bra, we've concluded that, A, we've been running that for a long time; B, a lot of customers came in and got their free panty and didn't buy anything else. And so we think there's a clever way, a smarter way to drive traffic, that's more healthy for the brand.

Just given your high-level view of the world, I was hoping, Stuart, maybe you could put some perspective on what you think might be going on with the consumer right now."

So with respect to the promotional changes and particularly the direct mail promotions that we've changed, we came to a conclusion about that or a decision about that in late March, which we implemented beginning in April. But as you would appreciate, Lindsay, the specific activity that we're lapping or anniversary-ing from last year varies by month, and there's a meaningful amount of activity in May of 2015 that we're lapping. And again, it does vary some by month. So didn't see a lot of -- saw some, but not a lot of impact in April. We'll see more in May. The other thing going on with May is there is the Memorial Day shift that affects comp. We think between 1 and 2 points as well. But that's -- that would be the color on the timing of our decision around the direct mail pullback. And again, the impact will vary some by month. And then with respect to a big picture view of the consumer, Nick could comment on that from Bath & Body, and his accent's better than mine. So let's listen to him for a while."

I think she continues to want to have a story or a compelling story told to her even though she remains value oriented. But if she sees something that she likes or if she's engaged, clearly, that value price fluctuates, and we can see it in both ways. We see it fluctuates. It's really important when a compelling story isn't told, but we can also see it become significantly less important when the product is good. So from that perspective, I think it's actually pretty consistent behavior. There's a lot of talk about where is the customer, what's she doing. But from that perspective, I think it's a pretty consistent story, and I think that also ties itself to traffic where we've been -- we've seen pretty consistent levels of traffic. Now we're having to work very hard to maintain the traffic, given the mall status. But my overall point of view is that the traffic is there. We're working hard to get it and have behaviors consistent. And at the end of the day when big periods happen, big time frames such as Mother's Day, she's still coming out and she still wants to participate.

Although we delivered first quarter results above our initial expectations, we were not satisfied with our overall results as adjusted operating income declined 4% compared to last year, primarily driven by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
We had a range of performance across the company in the first quarter with PINK and Bath & Body Works delivering strong results and weaker performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and Beauty. 
From a macro perspective, we did experience a deceleration in trend through the quarter, but we are focused on what we can control, and we have opportunities to improve our execution. It's important to note that we have made significant changes in the last couple of months at Victoria's Secret, making organizational and leadership changes, exiting merchandise categories, exiting nearly 300 people from the business and changing our promotional strategy. We're making these changes proactively from a position of strength and following a record fourth quarter and 2015 for the brand.
Our revised outlook for 2016 reflects the impact of the actions at Victoria's Secret as well as incremental cost related to our plan to develop China as a company-owned business. Our brands are strong, and we're energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to maximize profitability.

Secondly, we appear to be keeping customers pretty engaged through the newness and the compelling stories that we're telling, which is really important for us when you think about the destination brands. So we really need to continue to keep her engaged. 
Thirdly, for the most part, pretty pleased with customers' response to products and assortments and our collections. I think we can do better, but pretty happy from that perspective. As it relates to speed, really pleased with our ability to have been able to leverage the speed model into our ability to chase in the home business, and that's been important for us, not only because it's the most difficult business to chase into, but also because it's still a very, very healthy business for us. 
We're pretty pleased in terms of what we're seeing from the real estate investments and the type of return that we're getting there. So again, we're relatively pleased with what's happening then we'll continue to monitor that and read and react as we would. And then, finally, as we see the marketplace remains pretty dynamic, we'll continue to leverage our most important discipline, which is really the notion of staying as close as we can to the customer and then reading and reacting to her behavior.

And we're putting our energy against those core categories to accelerate growth in bras, panties and beauty. It is going to put some pressure on the business, along with some of the promotional changes that we're making, less direct mail couponing, et cetera. But as you outlined in your question, we have some expense savings that we've actioned as well including the elimination of the catalog spend and a meaningful reduction in our home, office overhead, which, in part, offsets the sales and profit pressure from the category exits and the impact of the promotional changes that we're implementing. But at the end of the day, as outlined in our commentary that we sent out last night and the brief remarks we made this morning, we're making these changes from a position of strength to accelerate growth in these core categories. And there'll be some short-term financial pressure, as outlined in our guidance, both for Q2 and the full year. But we'll then work hard to beat that guidance, as you would imagine, and we're absolutely confident that these changes are the right thing to do for the long-term health of Victoria's Secret, and again, to accelerate growth in that business."

One of the things I love about working for our company and Les's point of view most significantly, but the leadership team, our point of view, is that while we've reset guidance and I'm not altering that guidance in mindset, this isn't a reset year at all. So we're going to have some challenge in the near term, and we've done our best to outline that in our guidance. But I'll tell you, starting at the top and with some acknowledgment of short-term pressure, we're going to work very hard to exceed that guidance and in no way do we have in our mind that 2016 is a kind of a reset year with no growth. Again, the guidance is the guidance. But you should know and known us for a long time, our mindset is we're going to work very hard to drive great experiences for customers, very strong sales growth and resulting profit growth. So I'm glad you asked the question. And obviously, from that, expecting a very good 2016 after some short-term pressure. Again, the guidance is the guidance. And then certainly expect a very, very good 2017. So good question. With respect, Brian, to the traffic generated from direct mail couponing, we're working hard to replace that volume and that profit. And again, we're doing it for reasons that I think you appreciate from our earlier remarks in terms of doing promotion that drives trial in key categories. And at the end of the day is healthier, we believe, for the business. But in the short term, it's challenged, but we're doing a lot of things in terms of tests and rolling different ideas to ensure that we have healthy traffic and good sales results. And that will be a week-to-week, month-to-month exercise, but it's being very actively worked on Mondays and Tuesdays every week and with good test and learning and adjustment. Again, another thing I really enjoy about the company and respect about the company is that we test, we read, we react, we are agile in our thinking and in our execution. And it's more dynamic right now than typical, no doubt about that. But I'm confident that we'll read and react and adjust appropriately."

We're making important changes to the business. So just again, to step back and -- in an effort to respond to your question, we think that reorganizing the business into 3 units: Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret PINK and Victoria's Secret Beauty, each of which have the stores and direct activity under common leadership for those 3 businesses. We think that's an important change in organization that will simplify and focus the business on those 3 broad categories. In terms of guidepost or objectives, the purpose of all of it is to ensure that we're focused and to accelerate growth in core categories. Obviously, PINK has been our strongest performing business over the last several years, and that sales trend, that sales performance has continued in 2016. Beauty has been the weakest of the 3 businesses. And as we shared in our commentary, a new leader joining the business at the beginning of this month. And it will take some time. A logical question we get asked, understandably, within and outside the business is how long will it take to substantially improve the trend of that business. And it is a bit longer in lead time and cycle and approach development activities than some of our other categories. But with new leadership and again, the focus through the organizational changes I mentioned, certainly optimistic that we'll see an improvement in trend there. And then the Lingerie business, the core of the core in terms of bras and panties, a new leader coming in at the beginning of September with various substantial experience and an existing strong leadership team. So an additional resource in leadership -- leader coming in to strengthen that team. But coming from a good base and again, optimistic through these changes that it will accelerate growth. In all of the measures, whether it's customer satisfaction, sales growth, margin improvement, inventory turn, those are all the things that we'll be driving towards."

So when can you expect that it should start to make a contribution? Well, the sales contribution will start at the very end of this year. From a profit point of view, I don't really know. Our experience in the U.K. is that it takes 2 to 3 years to get a business from the investment phase to the profitable phase, and it really depends on the amount of time that we take to build it.

So with respect to catalog, we did test the elimination of catalog into significant markets for a year and saw a relatively small to no impact on sales. And if one does simple math on it, you need to get a lot of sales or meaningful amount of sales to pay for the catalog. In round numbers, we were spending $125 million to $150 million a year on the catalog. And we ran it again for a year in 2 significant markets and didn't see a significant change in sales. Separately and I think importantly for the whole business, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reduced our catalog activity by nominally 40%. And demand in the direct channel was up, if I remember right, about 15%. So both based on 2 markets that we tested in and significant reduction in activity in our fourth quarter last year for the whole business. It made us confident that while there might be some sales pressure, certainly from an operating income standpoint, meaning did it pay for itself, on an OI basis, we felt that this was an appropriate change to make in our business. Importantly, one of the things that we try to do is we say if we were starting this business today in current context 2016, would you start with one of your major ideas being a catalog, a paper-based catalog sent through the mail as one of your key, if not your key marketing activity for a global brand. And as we thought about it in that way, along with the numerical test and financial evaluation, very comfortable with the change that we've made. Separately, with respect to your second question on sales guidance and the reduction in comp guidance, I'm glad you asked. It's important to know that as we outlined in our overall remarks, that we have a range of performance in our business. So in terms of the sales reduction, we haven't changed our assumptions about Bath & Body Works at all. Bath & Body Works grew operating income 15% in the first quarter. There will be some occupancy pressure in that business in the latter half of the year in connection with the remodel activity for the White Barn and Bath & Body remodels, but Bath & Body is running a very good business. As we also outlined, the PINK business, very strong. So I wouldn't want outside analysts or investors to think that L Brands has a broad-based concern about sales trends. We actually have important parts of our business, most notably, Bath & Body Works and PINK that are doing very, very well. And we've got some pressure in other parts of our business in part due to changes that we're making in terms of category exits and reduction in promotional activity, but some weakness in the Beauty business that we've been experiencing now for some time. So a range of performance. Overall, yes, we've taken our numbers down, but it's on -- it's due to very specific things and only certain portions of our business. Thank you."

So in terms of what the Victoria's Secret business looks like in aggregate and by major component 5 years from now, as a mindset and in terms of goals that we aspire to in our business in many periods we accomplished, we're looking to grow the top line sales in major parts of our business in -- on the low side at 5% per year and on the high side, when we're really doing well, 10% or 15% per year. So in terms of what are we trying to get done top line-wise over the next 5 years, it would be growth ranging from 5% to 15%, depending upon category and frankly, how well we execute. In terms of the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret business, this is one of the best brands in the world. And from that brand, equity, emotional content, leadership position, when we execute really well, we have pricing power. We deliver emotion, great customer experiences, differentiated from competition, and that creates pricing power, which ultimately creates productivity and margin. And so with that belief and we've got to work hard to continue that leadership position, we believe the operating income rate for Victoria's Secret should absolutely be high-teens, if not 20% when we think about our own history and the best in the world. So hopefully that gives you some sense of our thinking and what our goals are over the next 5 years. In terms of the exits and their seasonality, the -- we will sell through the swim that we have at the swimsuit business that we have in stores in the spring season. And to the extent that we have some swim inventory remaining after spring, we'll sell that through the fall season 2016 in the direct channel. That's our current thinking and our current plan. With respect to the apparel exit, again, that's mostly or totally, I should say, in the direct channel. And we'll sell that both in the spring season and to some extent, into the fall season. So we're looking to, particularly in the store side of the business, move through the inventory. This is about swim at pretty reasonable pace to simplify store level execution. And frankly, to free up space for other categories, like core bras and sport and other things, but we won't be as urgent with respect to the swim and non-go-forward apparel exit indirect because it doesn't create the same kind of complexity from an operational standpoint in that channel. So in terms of dollarizing that by quarter, it's going to be more dynamic. But hopefully, that's helpful to you in an overall modeling sense."

Meaning, we have pretty good analytics around what we got from that activity historically. And what we're doing now, as I think you appreciate is, we're looking to replace that activity, which was -- we call that customer relationship management. What it really was, was couponing through the mail in many respects. And we're looking to substitute that with various category level promotions in particular that drive trial of key categories. That activity and the results from that new activity are being evaluated every week. And so that will be dynamic. And while the nature of the offers that we utilize through direct mail, which most typically were a free panty and $10 off a bra, we've concluded that, A, we've been running that for a long time; B, a lot of customers came in and got their free panty and didn't buy anything else. And so we think there's a clever way, a smarter way to drive traffic, that's more healthy for the brand.

So first of all, our total bra business, Lingerie, PINK and sport, store and direct, grew in the first quarter. So in aggregate, all types of bras across both channels had positive sales growth, high-low single digits in the first quarter. There are clearly some trends in the business, including the Bralette trend that you mentioned, and I think it's well-known and being well covered. And we're participating in that trend in a big way, as you would expect a market leader or the market leader to do. And frankly, that's -- there's nothing new about that. We're in a business that has different fashion trends from time to time. And hopefully, in most cases, we're leading those trends or certainly taking good advantage of those trends in things like sport bras or Bralettes, we think we're participating well with respect to those trends. So again, total bra business, including PINK, up. Certainly, some changes in trend that you comment on, that we're participating in. And we're working -- we're not satisfied with a bra business that -- we want it to grow faster than that and particularly, in the core Lingerie part of it. And it's not a sick business, but it's not growing at the rate we want. And it's so core to this business that, it's in part, why we're making some of the organizational and leadership changes that we've talked about."

By the way, a tough thing to do as a business leader and as business people. But from time to time, we make difficult decisions for the long-term health of the business. That would be an example of one of them. But we'll continue to be tough-minded about expenses.

I think she continues to want to have a story or a compelling story told to her even though she remains value oriented. But if she sees something that she likes or if she's engaged, clearly, that value price fluctuates, and we can see it in both ways. We see it fluctuates. It's really important when a compelling story isn't told, but we can also see it become significantly less important when the product is good. So from that perspective, I think it's actually pretty consistent behavior. There's a lot of talk about where is the customer, what's she doing. But from that perspective, I think it's a pretty consistent story, and I think that also ties itself to traffic where we've been -- we've seen pretty consistent levels of traffic. Now we're having to work very hard to maintain the traffic, given the mall status. But my overall point of view is that the traffic is there. We're working hard to get it and have behaviors consistent.

Although we delivered first quarter results above our initial expectations, we were not satisfied with our overall results as adjusted operating income declined 4% compared to last year, primarily driven by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
We had a range of performance across the company in the first quarter with PINK and Bath & Body Works delivering strong results and weaker performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and Beauty. 
From a macro perspective, we did experience a deceleration in trend through the quarter, but we are focused on what we can control, and we have opportunities to improve our execution. It's important to note that we have made significant changes in the last couple of months at Victoria's Secret, making organizational and leadership changes, exiting merchandise categories, exiting nearly 300 people from the business and changing our promotional strategy. We're making these changes proactively from a position of strength and following a record fourth quarter and 2015 for the brand.
Our revised outlook for 2016 reflects the impact of the actions at Victoria's Secret as well as incremental cost related to our plan to develop China as a company-owned business. Our brands are strong, and we're energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to maximize profitability.

And we're putting our energy against those core categories to accelerate growth in bras, panties and beauty. It is going to put some pressure on the business, along with some of the promotional changes that we're making, less direct mail couponing, et cetera. But as you outlined in your question, we have some expense savings that we've actioned as well including the elimination of the catalog spend and a meaningful reduction in our home, office overhead, which, in part, offsets the sales and profit pressure from the category exits and the impact of the promotional changes that we're implementing. But at the end of the day, as outlined in our commentary that we sent out last night and the brief remarks we made this morning, we're making these changes from a position of strength to accelerate growth in these core categories. And there'll be some short-term financial pressure, as outlined in our guidance, both for Q2 and the full year.

One of the things I love about working for our company and Les' point of view most significantly, but the leadership team, our point of view, is that while we've reset guidance and I'm not altering that guidance in mindset, this isn't a reset year at all. So we're going to have some challenge in the near term, and we've done our best to outline that in our guidance. But I'll tell you, starting at the top and with some acknowledgment of short-term pressure, we're going to work very hard to exceed that guidance and in no way do we have in our mind that 2016 is a kind of a reset year with no growth. Again, the guidance is the guidance. But you should know and known us for a long time, our mindset is we're going to work very hard to drive great experiences for customers, very strong sales growth and resulting profit growth. So I'm glad you asked the question. And obviously, from that, expecting a very good 2016 after some short-term pressure. Again, the guidance is the guidance. And then certainly expect a very, very good 2017. So good question. With respect, Brian, to the traffic generated from direct mail couponing, we're working hard to replace that volume and that profit. And again, we're doing it for reasons that I think you appreciate from our earlier remarks in terms of doing promotion that drives trial in key categories. And at the end of the day is healthier, we believe, for the business. But in the short term, it's challenged, but we're doing a lot of things in terms of tests and rolling different ideas to ensure that we have healthy traffic and good sales results. And that will be a week-to-week, month-to-month exercise, but it's being very actively worked on Mondays and Tuesdays every week and with good test and learning and adjustment. Again, another thing I really enjoy about the company and respect about the company is that we test, we read, we react, we are agile in our thinking and in our execution. And it's more dynamic right now than typical, no doubt about that. But I'm confident that we'll read and react and adjust appropriately."

We're making important changes to the business. So just again, to step back and -- in an effort to respond to your question, we think that reorganizing the business into 3 units: Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret PINK and Victoria's Secret Beauty, each of which have the stores and direct activity under common leadership for those 3 businesses. We think that's an important change in organization that will simplify and focus the business on those 3 broad categories. In terms of guidepost or objectives, the purpose of all of it is to ensure that we're focused and to accelerate growth in core categories. Obviously, PINK has been our strongest performing business over the last several years, and that sales trend, that sales performance has continued in 2016. Beauty has been the weakest of the 3 businesses. And as we shared in our commentary, a new leader joining the business at the beginning of this month. And it will take some time. A logical question we get asked, understandably, within and outside the business is how long will it take to substantially improve the trend of that business. And it is a bit longer in lead time and cycle and approach development activities than some of our other categories. But with new leadership and again, the focus through the organizational changes I mentioned, certainly optimistic that we'll see an improvement in trend there. And then the Lingerie business, the core of the core in terms of bras and panties, a new leader coming in at the beginning of September with various substantial experience and an existing strong leadership team. So an additional resource in leadership -- leader coming in to strengthen that team. But coming from a good base and again, optimistic through these changes that it will accelerate growth. In all of the measures, whether it's customer satisfaction, sales growth, margin improvement, inventory turn, those are all the things that we'll be driving towards."

It seems to me that we're going to be doing most of the heavy lifting anyway. And it makes sense that we should be in it completely. So when can you expect that it should start to make a contribution? Well, the sales contribution will start at the very end of this year. From a profit point of view, I don't really know. Our experience in the U.K. is that it takes 2 to 3 years to get a business from the investment phase to the profitable phase, and it really depends on the amount of time that we take to build it.

So with respect to catalog, we did test the elimination of catalog in 2 significant markets for a year and saw a relatively small to no impact on sales. And if one does simple math on it, you need to get a lot of sales or meaningful amount of sales to pay for the catalog. In round numbers, we were spending $125 million to $150 million a year on the catalog. And we ran it again for a year in 2 significant markets and didn't see a significant change in sales. Separately and I think importantly for the whole business, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reduced our catalog activity by nominally 40%. And demand in the direct channel was up, if I remember right, about 15%. So both based on 2 markets that we tested in and significant reduction in activity in our fourth quarter last year for the whole business. It made us confident that while there might be some sales pressure, certainly from an operating income standpoint, meaning did it pay for itself, on an OI basis, we felt that this was an appropriate change to make in our business. Importantly, one of the things that we try to do is we say if we were starting this business today in current context 2016, would you start with one of your major ideas being a catalog, a paper-based catalog sent through the mail as one of your key, if not your key marketing activity for a global brand. And as we thought about it in that way, along with the numerical test and financial evaluation, very comfortable with the change that we've made. Separately, with respect to your second question on sales guidance and the reduction in comp guidance, I'm glad you asked. It's important to know that as we outlined in our overall remarks, that we have a range of performance in our business. So in terms of the sales reduction, we haven't changed our assumptions about Bath & Body Works at all. Bath & Body Works grew operating income 15% in the first quarter. There will be some occupancy pressure in that business in the latter half of the year in connection with the remodel activity for the White Barn and Bath & Body remodels, but Bath & Body is running a very good business. As we also outlined, the PINK business, very strong. So I wouldn't want outside analysts or investors to think that L Brands has a broad-based concern about sales trends. We actually have important parts of our business, most notably, Bath & Body Works and PINK that are doing very, very well. And we've got some pressure in other parts of our business in part due to changes that we're making in terms of category exits and reduction in promotional activity, but some weakness in the Beauty business that we've been experiencing now for some time. So a range of performance. Overall, yes, we've taken our numbers down, but it's on -- it's due to very specific things and only certain portions of our business. Thank you."

So in terms of what the Victoria's Secret business looks like in aggregate and by major component 5 years from now, as a mindset and in terms of goals that we aspire to in our business in many periods we accomplished, we're looking to grow the top line sales in major parts of our business in -- on the low side at 5% per year and on the high side, when we're really doing well, 10% or 15% per year. So in terms of what are we trying to get done top line-wise over the next 5 years, it would be growth ranging from 5% to 15%, depending upon category and frankly, how well we execute. In terms of the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret business, this is one of the best brands in the world. And from that brand, equity, emotional content, leadership position, when we execute really well, we have pricing power. We deliver emotion, great customer experiences, differentiated from competition, and that creates pricing power, which ultimately creates productivity and margin. And so with that belief and we've got to work hard to continue that leadership position, we believe the operating income rate for Victoria's Secret should absolutely be high-teens, if not 20% when we think about our own history and the best in the world. So hopefully that gives you some sense of our thinking and what our goals are over the next 5 years. In terms of the exits and their seasonality, the -- we will sell through the swim that we have at the swimsuit business that we have in stores in the spring season. And to the extent that we have some swim inventory remaining after spring, we'll sell that through the fall season 2016 in the direct channel. That's our current thinking and our current plan. With respect to the apparel exit, again, that's mostly or totally, I should say, in the direct channel. And we'll sell that both in the spring season and to some extent, into the fall season. So we're looking to, particularly in the store side of the business, move through the inventory. This is about swim at pretty reasonable pace to simplify store level execution. And frankly, to free up space for other categories, like core bras and sport and other things, but we won't be as urgent with respect to the swim and non-go-forward apparel exit indirect because it doesn't create the same kind of complexity from an operational standpoint in that channel. So in terms of dollarizing that by quarter, it's going to be more dynamic. But hopefully, that's helpful to you in an overall modeling sense."

Meaning, we have pretty good analytics around what we got from that activity historically. And what we're doing now, as I think you appreciate is, we're looking to replace that activity, which was -- we call that customer relationship management. What it really was, was couponing through the mail in many respects. And we're looking to substitute that with various category level promotions in particular that drive trial of key categories. That activity and the results from that new activity are being evaluated every week. And so that will be dynamic. And while the nature of the offers that we utilize through direct mail, which most typically were a free panty and $10 off a bra, we've concluded that, A, we've been running that for a long time; B, a lot of customers came in and got their free panty and didn't buy anything else. And so we think there's a clever way, a smarter way to drive traffic, that's more healthy for the brand. The details of that are being literally worked every week, including test of key promotional ideas in the business. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of it. It would be easy to return to the prior approach, and we know what it's worth. So we have a pretty good sense of what it's worth. What's important here is we're making important changes in the promotional approach to the business for the long-term health of the business. It wouldn't be hard to turn that stuff back on in our collective judgment. The right thing to do for this business is to have smarter ideas about driving trial and driving traffic versus get a free panty and $10 off a bra."

But from that perspective, I think it's a pretty consistent story, and I think that also ties itself to traffic where we've been -- we've seen pretty consistent levels of traffic.

All that said, we'll continue to manage corporate overhead with discipline and will continue that mindset. In terms of the Bendel business, we remain optimistic about that concept and that brand, that business, that opportunity.

Second point I would probably register is that through promotional and other activity, changes in pricing and promotion, we certainly try to and did drive a lot on trial in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that in the fall season. So through pricing and promotional activity, driving trial in core categories of beauty to drive business, to drive results. And encouragingly, we're seeing some pretty good repeat, customer repeat, post trial of some of those products. The third thing I'd mention is Greg working with Les and others, developing a point of view and implementing a point of view about rationalizing or narrowing the assortment in a meaningful way this fall season. And then lastly, as you teed up in your question, we, in terms of what we're lapping, the year-on-year pressure in '16 will moderate as we go through the fall season. And maybe last, last is we all recognize the importance of speed in our business, and including through the eyes of new leadership, really working to reduce lead times in that business, make further use of the beauty park that we have for personal care and beauty at Victoria's Secret Beauty, and those changes are beginning. And we'll have some positive impact on the fall season. But -- so we'll see some year-on-year reduction in pressures certainly through fall. And it's such an important category.

So in terms of core lingerie, there are some important trends going on in the business, and we're taking significant action to participate in and frankly, lead with respect to those trends. And what I'm speaking about it, the unconstructed the bralette trend as one and separately, the Sport bra business as a second important development in the bra category. And we've made significant progress and drove meaningful growth in both of those areas in the second quarter, and intend to pursue those segments of the bra business very aggressively in the fall season. One of the important things about the bralette business are around constructed bra business, particularly as we do think it has a higher fashion element to us -- to it. and I think that's a good thing for us. We've been a fashion specialty retailer for a long time. Our abilities in terms of lead times and speed and read-and-react particularly play well into the bralette category. And while the AUR in bralettes is below some of the other categories in bras, we believe that the unit volume or their vacancy of purchase, given the fashion element to it, in part makes up for the lower AURs. So those are 2 important trends in the bra business. Again, we drove very significant growth in both of those trends in Q2 and expect the same or even greater growth in the fall season. In terms of the average unit retail, in total, importantly, in connection with our promotional changes, we had a large number of offers in our history, in our base, that included $10 off a bra. And we've substantially reduce or eliminated those offers. So that provides upside in the AUR. And kind of when you pull it all together, our nonredlined AUR for the second quarter was pretty consistent with prior year or steady with compared to prior year. So the combination of all those things, we didn't have a decline in AUR and nonredline categories the business. PINK continues to also grow its bra business at a very healthy rate. So some changing dynamics for sure. But we had good overall results in the bra business, driving sales growth and very optimistic about the fall season with respect to bras."

And so, as you know, Les Wexner and our company, we're not afraid to invest when we've got a trend and results and the payback, and we're investing record levels of CapEx in our business.

On the first part of your question, in terms of category performance and what's been driving our results, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we specifically called out our home fragrance business, which has been a consistent strong driver of our overall business now for the last several years. In addition to that, obviously, we have our other product categories, such as our Signature Collection fragrant body care business and our soap and sanitizer businesses. And while we do not call those out explicitly in our prepared remarks, those businesses are also growing over last year. And so, in total, I would say we continue to be pleased with our overall results and our overall portfolio of performance. I believe your second question was regarding our remodel strategy. As a reminder, that remodel strategy is one that is focused on touching this year about -- we'll finish this year with about 250 stores in that new remodel that again includes both a remodeled Bath & Body Works store, as well as a White Barn concept, either in a side-by-side location or a shop-in-shop format. And again, our overall results are -- continue to be very positive. We continue to be very pleased with that performance, and we are committed to driving continued investment into that strategy, both for the balance of this year and well into the next several years. And then last, your question on go forward and our thoughts there. Again, as you heard Stuart say, read-and-react is a very, very important lever in our business. And so as we start any new season, we go in with a relatively conservative perspective. We then follow the trends of the business. We're constantly testing whether it's new product categories, whether it's new promotional strategies, whether it's new storytelling strategies in stores, and we use that read-and-react capability to Chase to the upside. So again, as we come into the back half of the year, which is, especially in the Bath & Body Works business, a very important timeframe, we are still very confident in our ability to use that business model to chase to the upside."

I think the way you characterized the numbers is about right, $8 million of sales, about $8 million of loss. Sadly, it's hard to put those 2 things together because they reflect different parts of the business. So the sales reflect the VSBA stores that are up and running and are trading, the loss represents the efforts that are going into building the full assortment business, which will open in February of 2017. So there's 2 parts are not related to each other. In terms of thinking forward and how do we project what's going to happen over the next several months, very, very difficult to do that. What I would tell you is that we're on track to open 2 full assortment stores probably towards the end  of February 2017 and then another flagship store in Beijing around the middle of the year. And we'll continue to trade the VSBA business and add to that selectively probably about 6 doors over the course the next 6 months. And then in addition to the third parts of the business, which is our direct-to-consumer business, where later this fall, we will test a full Chinese language, Chinese currency sites, which will initially be fulfilled out of the USA on test basis ready for full fulfillment out of China in the middle of '17. So there's so many moving parts, Ike, that it really quite difficult to predict. We know, as you know, in terms of the way that we run the business, we don't spend that much time looking into the crystal ball to try and predict what will happen. We try and follow the pattern of test and learn. The most important thing is to get the business with the right brand presentation and the right way, see what happens and then reflects the ball and agile and adapt as necessary. But I'll probably be able to tell you more when we get to our investor conference later in the fall."

The amount of direct mail volume that we're lapping is more significant in Q3 and Q4 in dollars than it was in the second quarter. But Q4, in relation to the total quarter, would be a little less than Q3. Separately, one way that we were able to drive a lot of volume and we're committed to and did drive a lot of volume in the second quarter was clearance activity. We wanted to make sure that we ended the season clean. In particularly, as it relates to exited categories. And so that sales driver, if you will, or that source of sales that existed in the second quarter, we won't really have that opportunity in the third quarter. So able to replace some of the volume. Clearance was also a contributor in Q2. It does represent pressure in Q3 and Q4, but you should know that we have a mindset that we're going to offset that volume.

The other pressure that we had in -- the next because pressure would be related to beauty. And so, as you know, we restage what we referred to as in the fantasies. Last fall, we believe we improved the product quality a lot, the packaging and so on, a fair amount, which drove some increase in costs, which we were fine with. But as we've talked about previously, we needed to make some adjustment in pricing this spring to drive appropriate volume in that business. And so that combination of things, along with some use of beauty giveaways to drive business, bra basis and other business, put pressure on the business. And then going the other way, which you mentioned, but not as significant as the 2 things I just called out, was the benefit of the cessation of the direct mail couponing and promotional offers.

But again, you should know that will be working hard to offset that volume. With respect to the bra launch calendar and key drivers of bra growth in holiday, a couple of thoughts. You mentioned Jen. Jen hasn't started yet. She starts in early September. But that doesn't mean that we don't have a plan. We do have a plan. But given competitive aspects, Brian and so on, and I'm not trying to be in any way, unhelpful, but we'll cost to divest about our bra launch strategy for holiday, given where we are in the calendar, as helpful as I wanted to be in the competition.

So the bralette business and the sport business were very healthy for us and good growth in the second quarter. And the panty business, there's some good results there as well.

Again, in general, the remodels that we do that include a remodel of both of the Bath & Body Works portion of the store, as well as the addition of the White Barn component, whether it's in the shop-in-shop or side-by-side format, is driving total performance the overall box. So we do see a lift in essentially all categories when we do one of those remodels. Under the covers, we do see a slightly higher growth rate in our home fragrance business associated with again, that addition of a unique White Barn component. And so that is something that we do see as a result of that real estate strategy. In terms of different products or new products in those stores. Again, there are more home decor aspects in the White Barn portion of those stores, but that is not a larger material portion of the overall performance of those stores. On your question of whether or not we're seeing that as an incremental purchase, we are absolutely seeing incrementality across all of the aspects of those remodel activities in terms of driving sales across all categories. So yes, we would definitely categorize that as incremental."

So we would create our paper pretty well for the second quarter with high ambition for the fall season in terms of growth of sport and particularly sport bras.

And then when we look on a go-forward basis, that buying and occupancy growth, we do expect to continue, not only in the back half of 2016, but frankly, into 2017, as again, we continue on this initiative.

The most important point I want to register, frankly, in response to the question, I mean it sincerely. But I think its most of what I think for an investor to understand about us is we're not trying to win by being the low-cost player. It's not what we do. And so you're asking about cost input. And I understand, we're a big company, and we do pay attention to cost, whether it's about product cost or other costs inputs in our business. But what this management team is most focused on is delivering emotional content, great customer experiences, great store environments, great digital experiences, great interactions with store associates, et cetera, and we're willing to pay for that. And great product quality as well. So are there material changes in input cost related to merchandise fall '16 versus fall '15? I would say no. Are there some changes related to mix? Yes, sure. But in terms of year-on-year cost input related to merchandise, no significant changes. We got a great sourcing organization that does terrific work. But what their most focus on his product quality and speed that do manage cost, but no big changes. With respect to wage inflation, we are seeing that more in the United States, which is at the end the day, probably a good thing. As you know from prior conversations we've had, we want to make sure that we're attracting and retaining terrific associates, whether it's at the store level, in our distribution centers, in our home office. And so we're not looking to be the low-cost player in those spaes either. We're looking to pay for terrific people, ensure that we're getting productivity from those people in terms of sales productivity in stores or other forms of productivity in other parts of our business. But in terms of cost pressures, the wage piece is affecting store selling. But as you again heard us talk about over time, we believe that through sales growth and other leverage that can come from more productive store associates, we don't -- we believe that we shouldn't have, over time, significant deleverage in store selling cost. Lastly, you mentioned the catalog. We did see producing the catalog this spring.,, A big cost in our business, I think, as part of that are asking, there going to be changes in marketing and Victoria's Secret? There already have been and I'm sure they'll continue to be more. And so -- and I don't mean that in an unsettling way, but that's just clear dynamic aspect of our business. And we've made some good progress in marketing in the second quarter, but there will be more change in fall. And I'm sure there'll be more change in 2017."

He started in May. He's learning about L Brands and Victoria's Secret and is on boarding, but now getting into the business of the business, if you will. Second point I would probably register is that through promotional and other activity, changes in pricing and promotion, we certainly tried to and did drive a lot of trial in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that in the fall season. So through pricing and promotional activity, driving trial in core categories of beauty to drive business, to drive results. And encouragingly, we're seeing some pretty good repeat -- customer repeat post trial with some of those products. The third thing I'd mention is Greg working with Les and others, developing a point of view and implementing a point of view about rationalizing or narrowing the assortment in a meaningful way this fall season. And then lastly, as you teed up in your question, we, in terms of what we're lapping, the year-on-year pressure in '16 will moderate as we go through the fall season. And maybe last, last is we all recognize the importance of speed in our business, and including, through the eyes of new leadership, really working to reduce lead times in that business, make further use of the beauty park that we have for personal care and beauty at Victoria's Secret Beauty. And those changes are beginning, and we'll have some positive impact on the fall season. But -- so we'll see some year-on-year reduction in pressures certainly through fall. And it's such an important category. It's such a strong category for us, that we're very committed to it and optimistic about the growth potential for that business over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months."

Secondly, our investment in China and its impact on SG&A is more significant in the third quarter than it was in the second. And then lastly, as I mentioned in the context of the Other segment, our spring and Q2 specifically, expenses related to short-term incentive comp provided benefit in Q2.

So in terms of core lingerie, there are some important trends going on in the business, and we're taking significant action to participate in and frankly, lead with respect to those trends. And what I'm speaking about is the unconstructed or bralette trend as one and separately, the sport bra business as a second important development in the bra category. And we've made significant progress and drove meaningful growth in both of those areas in the second quarter and intend to pursue those segments of the bra business very aggressively in the fall season. One of the important things about the bralette business or unconstructed bra business, particularly as we do think it has a higher fashion element to us -- to it and I think that's a good thing for us, we've been a fashion specialty retailer for a long time, our abilities in terms of lead times and speed and read-and-react particularly play well into the bralette category. And while the AUR in bralettes is below some of the other categories in bras, we believe that the unit volume or their frequency of purchase, given the fashion element to it, in part makes up for the lower AURs. So those are 2 important trends in the bra business. Again, we drove very significant growth in both of those trends in Q2 and expect the same or even greater growth in the fall season. In terms of the average unit retail, in total, importantly, in connection with our promotional changes, we had a large number of offers in our history, in our base, that included $10 off a bra. And we've substantially reduced or eliminated those offers. So that provides upside in the AUR. And kind of when you pull it all together, our nonredline AUR for the second quarter was pretty consistent with prior year or steady with -- compared to prior year. So the combination of all those things, we didn't have a decline in AUR in nonredline categories of the business. PINK continues to also grow its bra business at a very healthy rate. So some changing dynamics for sure, but we had good overall results in the bra business, driving sales growth and very optimistic about the fall season with respect to bras."

Their ability to execute their business in season and longer term is outstanding. Their use of speed, read-and-react capability is terrific. So they have a very clear customer segment. They're executing very well. They have very deep and strong capabilities. With respect to investing in that business, a lot of the square footage that we're adding and a lot of the capital that we're spending on real estate is positioning and supporting PINK growth. And so, as you know, Les Wexner and our company, we're not afraid to invest when we've got a trend and results and the payback, and we're investing record levels of CapEx in our business. And not suggesting that all that money is going to PINK, but a lot of it is in terms of square footage growth of Victoria's, and again, a lot of that are flowing to PINK. Denise is very optimistic about the fall season. It's off to a good start. And again, their ability to read, react and adjust within the season is very strong.

On the first part of your question, in terms of category performance and what's been driving our results, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we specifically called out our home fragrance business, which has been a consistent strong driver of our overall business now for the last several years. In addition to that, obviously, we have our other product categories, such as our Signature Collection fragrant for our body care business and our soap and sanitizer businesses. And while we did not call those out explicitly in our prepared remarks, those businesses are also growing over the last year. And so, in total, I would say we continue to be pleased with our overall results and our overall portfolio of performance. I believe your second question was regarding our remodel strategy. As a reminder, that remodel strategy is one that is focused on touching this year about -- we'll finish this year with about 250 stores in that new remodel that, again, includes both a remodeled Bath & Body Works store as well as a White Barn concept, either in a side-by-side location or a shop-in-shop format. And again, our overall results are -- continue to be very positive. We continue to be very pleased with that performance, and we are committed to driving continued investment into that strategy, both for the balance of this year and well into the next several years. And then last, your question on go forward and our thoughts there. Again, as you've heard Stuart say, read-and-react is a very, very important lever in our business. And so as we start any new season, we go in with a relatively conservative perspective. We then follow the trends of the business. We're constantly testing whether it's new product categories, whether it's new promotional strategies, whether it's new storytelling strategies in stores, and we use that read-and-react capability to chase to the upside. So again, as we come into the back half of the year, which is, especially in the Bath & Body Works business, a very important time frame, we are still very confident in our ability to use that business model to chase to the upside."

I think the way you characterized the numbers is about right, $8 million of sales, about $8 million of loss. Sadly, it's hard to put those 2 things together because they reflect different parts of the business. So the sales reflect the VSBA stores that are up and running and are trading. The loss represents the efforts that are going into building the full assortment business, which will open in February of 2017. So those 2 parts are not related to each other. In terms of thinking forward and how do we project what's going to happen over the next several months, very, very difficult to do that. What I would tell you is that we're on track to open 2 full assortment stores probably towards the end  of February 2017 and then another flagship store in Beijing around the middle of the year. And we'll continue to trade the VSBA business and add to that selectively, probably about 6 doors over the course the next 6 months. And then in addition to the third part of the business, which is our direct-to-consumer business, where, later this fall, we will test a full Chinese language, Chinese currency site, which will initially be fulfilled out of the USA on a test basis, ready for full fulfillment out of China in the middle of '17. So there's so many moving parts, Ike, that it really is quite difficult to predict. We know, as you know, in terms of the way that we run the business, we don't spend that much time looking into the crystal ball to try and predict what will happen. We try and follow the pattern of test and learn. The most important thing is to get the business stood up with the right brand presentation in the right way, see what happens, and then deflect the ball and agile -- and adapt as necessary.

With that said, and again, as I think you appreciate and we've talked about on the call, we've been able to replace a lot of that volume through our targeted promotions, particularly as it relates to the sport bras and bralettes. The amount of direct mail volume that we're lapping is more significant in Q3 and Q4 in dollars than it was in the second quarter. But Q4, in relation to the total quarter, would be a little less than Q3. Separately, one way that we were able to drive a lot of volume, and we're committed to and did drive a lot of volume in the second quarter, was clearance activity. We wanted to make sure that we ended the season clean, and particularly, as it relates to exited categories. And so that sales driver, if you will, or that source of sales that existed in the second quarter, we won't really have that opportunity in the third quarter. So able to replace some of the volume. Clearance was also a contributor in Q2. It does represent pressure in Q3 and Q4, but you should know that we're of a mindset that we're going to offset that volume, whether that's every month or every week and the right people involved in those discussions, including Les and other leaders the business, we're working hard to replace that volume and do it in a way that's healthier for the brand and that drives trial in business in core categories."

Thanks, Paul. And in terms of the magnitude, the effect of clearance related to exits and just ensuring that we ended the spring season clean, that drag or that pressure, Paul, was the biggest impact of any of the impacts in the margin rate for Victoria's for the second quarter. The other pressure that we had -- the next biggest pressure would be related to beauty. And so, as you know, we restaged what we referred to as the fantasies business. Last fall, we believe we improved the product quality a lot, the packaging and so on, a fair amount, which drove some increase in costs, which we were fine with. But as we've talked about previously, we needed to make some adjustment in pricing this spring to drive appropriate volume in that business. And so that combination of things, along with some use of beauty giveaways to drive business, bra business and other business, put pressure on the business. And then going the other way, which you mentioned, but not as significant as the 2 things I just called out, was the benefit of the cessation of the direct mail couponing and promotional offers. So those would be the main drivers."

And certainly, we'll work to do that next spring. Does the math get harder next spring in terms the dollar impacts of those exits? It does. But again, you should know that we'll be working hard to offset that volume. With respect to the bra launch calendar and key drivers of bra growth in holiday, a couple of thoughts. You mentioned Jan. Jan hasn't started yet. She starts in early September. But that doesn't mean that we don't have a plan. We do have a plan. But given competitive aspects, Brian, and so on, and I'm not trying to be, in any way, unhelpful, but we'll be close to divest about our bra launch strategy for holiday, given where we are in the calendar, as helpful as I want to be at the competition.

But headline answer to your question, some upside related to clearance. And then I would -- the second thought I would register in being repetitive, but it's a theme through the dialogue, is that we drove some good volume in some of these emerging trends in the bra business. So the bralette business and the sport business were very healthy for us and good growth in the second quarter. And the panty business, we've got some good results there as well. So that's what I would call out. And PINK continued to have a very nice business in the second quarter as well.

We think we're well-positioned today, generating very significant -- very substantial growth. But we're working hard to accelerate that growth, and frankly, increase our position and our dominance in that space. And so you're seeing regular flow of new products. You're seeing relatively sharp price points. You're seeing promotion targeted to sport, and we're getting good results. So we would create our paper pretty well for the second quarter with high ambition for the fall season in terms of growth of sport and particularly sport bras. In terms of the comp needed for -- to leverage buying and occupancy, given the benefit of the catalog lap there, low single-digit would be the breakpoint, if you will, to get P&L leverage within gross margin net of the benefit of the catalog elimination."

As you saw in our prepared remarks, obviously, buying and occupancy is a growing expense associated with all the real estate remodel activity that we spent some time discussing today. And if you're looking at the difference between second quarter 2016 versus first quarter 2016, it is that growth in buying and occupancy costs that was the driver of slightly lower total operating income growth in Q2 versus what we experienced in Q1. And then when we look on a go-forward basis, that buying and occupancy growth, we do expect to continue, not only in the back half of 2016, but frankly, into 2017, as again, we continue on this initiative. As I've mentioned earlier on the call, we obviously are seeing very good results associated with the real estate remodel strategy in general. And so we remain very committed to those investments.

The most important point I want to register, frankly, in response to the question, I mean it sincerely. But I think it's the most important thing for an investor to understand about us is we're not trying to win by being the low-cost player. It's not what we do. And so you're asking about cost inputs. And I understand, I mean, we're a big company and we do pay attention to costs, whether it's about product costs or other cost inputs in our business. But what this management team is most focused on is delivering emotional content, great customer experiences, great store environments, great digital experiences, great interactions with store associates, et cetera, and we're willing to pay for that. And great product quality as well. So are there material changes in input costs related to merchandise fall '16 versus fall '15? I would say no. Are there some changes related to mix? Yes, sure. But in terms of year-on-year cost input related to merchandise, no significant changes. We got a great sourcing organization that does terrific work. But what they're most focused on is product quality and speed that do manage cost, but no big changes. With respect to wage inflation, we are seeing that more in the United States, which is, at the end the day, probably a good thing. As you know from prior conversations we've had, we want to make sure that we're attracting and retaining terrific associates, whether it's at the store level, in our distribution centers, in our home office. And so we're not looking to be the low-cost player in those spaces either. We're looking to pay for terrific people, ensure that we're getting productivity from those people in terms of sales productivity in stores or other forms of productivity in other parts of our business. But in terms of cost pressures, the wage piece is affecting store selling. But as you again heard us talk about over time, we believe that through sales growth and other leverage that can come from more productive store associates, we don't -- we believe that we shouldn't have, over time, significant deleverage in store selling costs. Lastly, you mentioned the catalog. We did cease producing the catalog this spring. A big cost in our business, I think, as part of that you're asking, are there going to be changes in marketing at Victoria's Secret? There already have been and I'm sure they'll continue to be more. And so -- and I don't mean that in an unsettling way, but that's just the dynamic aspect of our business. And we've made some good progress in marketing in the second quarter, but there will be more change in fall. And I'm sure there'll be more change in 2017."

He started in May. He's learning about L Brands and Victoria's Secret and is on-boarding, but now getting into the business of the business, if you will. Second point I would probably register is that through promotional and other activity, changes in pricing and promotion, we certainly tried to and did drive a lot of trial in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that in the fall season. So through pricing and promotional activity, driving trial in core categories of beauty to drive business, to drive results. And encouragingly, we're seeing some pretty good repeat -- customer repeat post-trial with some of those products. The third thing I'd mention is Greg working with Les and others, developing a point of view and implementing a point of view about rationalizing or narrowing the assortment in a meaningful way this fall season. And then lastly, as you teed up in your question, we, in terms of what we're lapping, the year-on-year pressure in '16 will moderate as we go through the fall season. And maybe last, last is we all recognize the importance of speed in our business, and including, through the eyes of new leadership, really working to reduce lead times in that business, make further use of the beauty park that we have for personal care and beauty at Victoria's Secret Beauty. And those changes are beginning, and we'll have some positive impact on the fall season. But -- so we'll see some year-on-year reduction in pressures certainly through fall.

But just in terms of the math of it and the impact on rate guidance, we have a more conservative assumption about comp and total sales growth in Q3 versus Q2. Secondly, our investment in China and its impact on SG&A is more significant in the third quarter than it was in the second. And then lastly, as I mentioned in the context of the Other segment, our spring and Q2 specifically, expenses related to short-term incentive comp provided benefit in Q2. And our going-in assumption for Q3 is that, year-on-year, the benefit won't be as significant in the third quarter. So those would be the highlights."

So in terms of core lingerie, there are some important trends going on in the business, and we're taking significant action to participate in and frankly, lead with respect to those trends. And what I'm speaking about is the unconstructed or bralette trend as one and separately, the sport bra business as a second important development in the bra category. And we've made significant progress and drove meaningful growth in both of those areas in the second quarter and intend to pursue those segments of the bra business very aggressively in the fall season. One of the important things about the bralette business or unconstructed bra business, particularly as we do think it has a higher fashion element to us -- to it and we think that's a good thing for us, we've been a fashion specialty retailer for a long time, our abilities in terms of lead times and speed and read-and-react particularly play well into the bralette category. And while the AUR in bralettes is below some of the other categories in bras, we believe that the unit volume or their frequency of purchase, given the fashion element to it, in part makes up for the lower AURs. So those are 2 important trends in the bra business. Again, we drove very significant growth in both of those trends in Q2 and expect the same or even greater growth in the fall season. In terms of the average unit retail, in total, importantly, in connection with our promotional changes, we had a large number of offers in our history, in our base, that included $10 off a bra. And we've substantially reduced or eliminated those offers. So that provides upside in the AUR. And kind of when you pull it all together, our non-redline AUR for the second quarter was pretty consistent with prior year or steady with -- compared to prior year. So the combination of all those things, we didn't have a decline in AUR in non-redline categories of the business. PINK continues to also grow its bra business at a very healthy rate. So some changing dynamics for sure, but we had good overall results in the bra business, driving sales growth and very optimistic about the fall season with respect to bras."

Their ability to execute their business in season and longer term is outstanding. Their use of speed, read-and-react capability is terrific. So they have a very clear customer segment. They're executing very well. They have very deep and strong capabilities. With respect to investing in that business, a lot of the square footage that we're adding and a lot of the capital that we're spending on real estate is positioning and supporting PINK growth. And so, as you know, Les Wexner and our company, we're not afraid to invest when we've got a trend and results and the payback, and we're investing record levels of CapEx in our business. And not suggesting that all that money is going to PINK, but a lot of it is in terms of square footage growth of Victoria's, and again, a lot of that flowing to PINK. Denise is very optimistic about the fall season. It's off to a good start. And again, their ability to read, react and adjust within the season is very strong.

On the first part of your question, in terms of category performance and what's been driving our results, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we specifically called out our home fragrance business, which has been a consistent strong driver of our overall business now for the last several years. In addition to that, obviously, we have our other product categories, such as our Signature Collection fragrant body care business and our soap and sanitizer businesses. And while we did not call those out explicitly in our prepared remarks, those businesses are also growing over the last year. And so, in total, I would say we continue to be pleased with our overall results and our overall portfolio of performance. I believe your second question was regarding our remodel strategy. As a reminder, that remodel strategy is one that is focused on touching this year about -- we'll finish this year with about 250 stores in that new remodel that, again, includes both a remodeled Bath & Body Works store as well as a White Barn concept, either in a side-by-side location or a shop-in-shop format. And again, our overall results are -- continue to be very positive. We continue to be very pleased with that performance, and we are committed to driving continued investment into that strategy, both for the balance of this year and well into the next several years. And then last, your question on go forward and our thoughts there. Again, as you've heard Stuart say, read-and-react is a very, very important lever in our business. And so as we start any new season, we go in with a relatively conservative perspective. We then follow the trends of the business. We're constantly testing, whether it's new product categories, whether it's new promotional strategies, whether it's new storytelling strategies in stores, and we use that read-and-react capability to chase to the upside. So again, as we come into the back half of the year, which is, especially in the Bath & Body Works business, a very important time frame, we are still very confident in our ability to use that business model to chase to the upside."

And that might be trial in beauty, as we've talked about. It might be trial in sport or sharp pricing and promotions related to the bra business and particularly, the unconstructed bra business. I would say we absolutely have shown that we can drive trial in those important categories. We are lapping a lot of this direct-mail volume, and that amount of business that was driven is more significant in Q3 than it was in Q2. But again, our view is we really want to have purposed promotions that are brand-building and drive trial for merchandise that we think is terrific merchandise.

I think the way you characterized the numbers is about right, $8 million of sales, about $8 million of loss. Sadly, it's hard to put those 2 things together because they reflect different parts of the business. So the sales reflect the VSBA stores that are up and running and are trading. The loss represents the efforts that are going into building the full-assortment business, which will open in February of 2017. So those 2 parts are not related to each other. In terms of thinking forward and how do we project what's going to happen over the next several months, very, very difficult to do that. What I would tell you is that we're on track to open 2 full-assortment stores probably towards the end of February 2017 and then another flagship store in Beijing around the middle of the year. And we'll continue to trade the VSBA business and add to that selectively, probably about 6 stores over the course the next 6 months. And then in addition, there's a third part to the business, which is our direct-to-consumer business, where, later this fall, we will test a full Chinese-language, Chinese-currency site, which will initially be fulfilled out of the USA on a test basis, ready for full fulfillment out of China in the middle of '17. So there's just so many moving parts, Ike, that it really is quite difficult to predict. We don't -- as you know, in terms of the way that we run the business, we don't spend that much time looking into the crystal ball to try and predict what will happen. We try and follow the pattern of test and learn. The most important thing is to get the business stood up with the right brand presentation in the right way, see what happens, and then be flexible and agile and adapt as necessary. But I'll probably be able to tell you more when we get to our investor conference later in the fall."

And the good news is through our efforts in unconstructed bras, bralettes, sport bras, we're absolutely seeing a shift to a younger customer, which we view very positively.

With that said, and again, as I think you appreciate and we've talked about on the call, we've been able to replace a lot of that volume through our targeted promotions, particularly as it relates to the sport bras and bralettes. The amount of direct mail volume that we're lapping is more significant in Q3 and Q4 in dollars than it was in the second quarter. But Q4, in relation to the total quarter, would be a little less than Q3. Separately, one way that we were able to drive a lot of volume, and were committed to and did drive a lot of volume in the second quarter, was clearance activity. We wanted to make sure that we ended the season clean, and particularly, as it relates to exited categories. And so that sales driver, if you will, or that source of sales that existed in the second quarter, we won't really have that opportunity in the third quarter. So able to replace some of the volume. Clearance was also a contributor in Q2. It does represent pressure in Q3 and Q4, but you should know that we're of a mindset that we're going to offset that volume, whether that's every month or every week, and the right people involved in those discussions, including Les and other leaders the business. We're working hard to replace that volume and do it in a way that's healthier for the brand and that drives trial and business in core categories."

The other pressure that we had -- the next-biggest pressure would be related to beauty. And so, as you know, we restaged what we referred to as the fantasies business last fall. We believe we improved the product quality a lot, the packaging and so on, a fair amount, which drove some increase in costs, which we were fine with. But as we've talked about previously, we needed to make some adjustment in pricing this spring to drive appropriate volume in that business. And so that combination of things, along with some use of beauty giveaways to drive business, bra business and other business, put pressure on the business. And then going the other way, which you mentioned, but not as significant as the 2 things I just called out, was the benefit of the cessation of the direct-mail couponing and promotional offers. So those would be the main drivers."

But headline answer to your question, some upside related to clearance. And then I would -- the second thought I would register, I'm being repetitive, but it's a theme through the dialogue, is that we drove some good volume in some of these emerging trends in the bra business. So the bralette business and the sport business were very healthy for us and good growth in the second quarter. And the panty business, we've got some good results there as well. So that's what I would call out. And PINK continued to have a very nice business in the second quarter as well.

The most important point I want to register, frankly, in response to the question, and I mean this sincerely, but I think it's the most important thing for an investor to understand about us, is we're not trying to win by being the low-cost player. It's not what we do. And so you're asking about cost inputs. And I understand, I mean, we're a big company and we do pay attention to costs, whether it's about product costs or other cost inputs in our business. But what this management team is most focused on is delivering emotional content, great customer experiences, great store environments, great digital experiences, great interactions with store associates, et cetera, and we're willing to pay for that. And great product quality as well. So are there material changes in input costs related to merchandise fall '16 versus fall '15? I would say no. Are there some changes related to mix? Yes, sure. But in terms of year-on-year cost input related to merchandise, no significant changes. We got a great sourcing organization that does terrific work. But what they're most focused on is product quality and speed. They do manage cost, but no big changes. With respect to wage inflation, we are seeing that more in the United States, which is, at the end the day, probably a good thing. As you know from prior conversations we've had, we want to make sure that we're attracting and retaining terrific associates, whether it's at the store level, in our distribution centers, in our home office. And so we're not looking to be the low-cost player in those spaces either. We're looking to pay for terrific people, ensure that we're getting productivity from those people in terms of sales productivity in stores or other forms of productivity in other parts of our business. But in terms of cost pressures, the wage piece is affecting store selling. But as you again heard us talk about over time, we believe that through sales growth and other levers that can come from more productive store associates, we don't -- we believe that we shouldn't have, over time, significant deleverage in store selling costs. Lastly, you mentioned the catalog. We did cease producing the catalog this spring. A big cost in our business. I think, as part of that, you're asking, are there going to be changes in marketing at Victoria's Secret? There already have been and I'm sure there will continue to be more. And so -- and I don't mean that in an unsettling way, but that's just the dynamic aspect of our business. And we've made some good progress in marketing in the second quarter, but there will be more change in fall. And I'm sure there'll be more change in 2017."

He started in May. He's learning about L Brands and Victoria's Secret and is on-boarding, but now getting into the business of the business, if you will. Second point I would probably register is that through promotional and other activity, changes in pricing and promotion, we certainly tried to and did drive a lot of trial in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that in the fall season. So through pricing and promotional activity, driving trial in core categories of beauty to drive business, to drive results. And encouragingly, we're seeing some pretty good repeat -- customer repeat post-trial with some of those products. The third thing I'd mention is Greg working with Les and others, developing a point of view and implementing a point of view about rationalizing or narrowing the assortment in a meaningful way this fall season. And then lastly, as you teed up in your question, we, in terms of what we're lapping, the year-on-year pressure in '16 will moderate as we go through the fall season. And maybe last, last is we all recognize the importance of speed in our business, and including, through the eyes of new leadership, really working to reduce lead times in that business, make further use of the beauty park that we have for personal care and beauty at Victoria's Secret Beauty. And those changes are beginning, and we'll have some positive impact on the fall season. But -- so we'll see some year-on-year reduction in pressures certainly through fall.

So in terms of core lingerie, there are some important trends going on in the business, and we're taking significant action to participate in and frankly, lead with respect to those trends. And what I'm speaking about is the unconstructed or bralette trend as one and separately, the sport bra business as a second important development in the bra category. And we've made significant progress and drove meaningful growth in both of those areas in the second quarter and intend to pursue those segments of the bra business very aggressively in the fall season. One of the important things about the bralette business or unconstructed bra business, particularly as we do think it has a higher fashion element to us -- to it and we think that's a good thing for us, we've been a fashion specialty retailer for a long time, our abilities in terms of lead times and speed and read-and-react particularly play well into the bralette category. And while the AUR in bralettes is below some of the other categories in bras, we believe that the unit volume or their frequency of purchase, given the fashion element to it, in part makes up for the lower AURs. So those are 2 important trends in the bra business. Again, we drove very significant growth in both of those trends in Q2 and expect the same or even greater growth in the fall season. In terms of the average unit retail, in total, importantly, in connection with our promotional changes, we had a large number of offers in our history, in our base, that included $10 off a bra. And we've substantially reduced or eliminated those offers. So that provides upside in the AUR. And kind of when you pull it all together, our non-redline AUR for the second quarter was pretty consistent with prior year or steady with -- compared to prior year. So the combination of all those things, we didn't have a decline in AUR in non-redline categories of the business. PINK continues to also grow its bra business at a very healthy rate. So some changing dynamics for sure, but we had good overall results in the bra business, driving sales growth and very optimistic about the fall season with respect to bras."

But the -- Denise Landman and the team there are very, very good at what they do. As you know, they have a clear mindset on their target customer. Their ability to execute their business in season and longer term is outstanding. Their use of speed, read-and-react capability is terrific. So they have a very clear customer segment. They're executing very well. They have very deep and strong capabilities. With respect to investing in that business, a lot of the square footage that we're adding and a lot of the capital that we're spending on real estate is positioning and supporting PINK growth. And so as you know, Les Wexner and our company, we're not afraid to invest when we've got a trend and results and the payback, and we're investing record levels of CapEx in our business. And not suggesting that all that money is going to PINK, but a lot of it is in terms of square footage growth of Victoria's, and again, a lot of that flowing to PINK. Denise is very optimistic about the fall season. It's off to a good start. And again, their ability to read, react and adjust within the season is very strong.

On the first part of your question, in terms of category performance and what's been driving our results, as you saw in our prepared remarks, we specifically called out our home fragrance business, which has been a consistent strong driver of our overall business now for the last several years. In addition to that, obviously, we have our other product categories, such as our Signature Collection fragrant body care business and our soap and sanitizer businesses. And while we did not call those out explicitly in our prepared remarks, those businesses are also growing over the last year. And so in total, I would say we continue to be pleased with our overall results and our overall portfolio of performance. I believe your second question was regarding our remodel strategy. As a reminder, that remodel strategy is one that is focused on touching this year about -- we'll finish this year with about 250 stores in that new remodel that, again, includes both a remodeled Bath & Body Works store as well as a White Barn concept, either in a side-by-side location or a shop-in-shop format. And again, our overall results are -- continue to be very positive. We continue to be very pleased with that performance, and we are committed to driving continued investment into that strategy, both for the balance of this year and well into the next several years. And then last, your question on go forward and our thoughts there. Again, as you've heard Stuart say, read-and-react is a very, very important lever in our business. And so as we start any new season, we go in with a relatively conservative perspective. We then follow the trends of the business. We're constantly testing, whether it's new product categories, whether it's new promotional strategies, whether it's new storytelling strategies in stores, and we use that read-and-react capability to chase to the upside. So again, as we come into the back half of the year, which is, especially in the Bath & Body Works business, a very important time frame, we are still very confident in our ability to use that business model to chase to the upside."

I would say we absolutely have shown that we can drive trial in those important categories. We are lapping a lot of this direct mail volume, and that amount of business that was driven is more significant in Q3 than it was in Q2. But again, our view is we really want to have purposed promotions that are brand-building and drive trial for merchandise that we think is terrific merchandise.

I think the way you characterized the numbers is about right, $8 million of sales, about $8 million of loss. Sadly, it's hard to put those 2 things together because they reflect different parts of the business. So the sales reflect the VSBA stores that are up and running and are trading. The loss represents the efforts that are going into building the full-assortment business, which will open in February of 2017. So those 2 parts are not related to each other. In terms of thinking forward and how do we project what's going to happen over the next several months, very, very difficult to do that. What I would tell you is that we're on track to open 2 full-assortment stores probably towards the end of February 2017 and then another flagship store in Beijing around the middle of the year. And we'll continue to trade the VSBA business and add to that selectively, probably about 6 stores over the course the next 6 months. And then in addition, there's a third part to the business, which is our direct-to-consumer business, where, later this fall, we will test a full Chinese-language, Chinese-currency site, which will initially be fulfilled out of the USA on a test basis, ready for full fulfillment out of China in the middle of '17. So there's just so many moving parts, Ike, that it really is quite difficult to predict. We don't -- as you know, in terms of the way that we run the business, we don't spend that much time looking into the crystal ball to try and predict what will happen. We try and follow the pattern of test and learn. The most important thing is to get the business stood up with the right brand presentation in the right way, see what happens, and then be flexible and agile and adapt as necessary. But I'll probably be able to tell you more when we get to our investor conference later in the fall."

I was wondering if, now that you're a few months in, you could talk about how much you think the shift in promotional strategy is weighing on your sort of core lingerie business. So from a comp perspective, what sort of order of magnitude drag it's been? It seems like it's probably been less of a drag than what you were initially thinking about when you talked to us after the first quarter. And as you contemplate your guidance for the full year, what sort of an overhang you think that is to Victoria's into the back half? To the degree that 3Q had more of a year-over-year comparison, is that even more amplified in the fourth quarter?"

With that said, and again, as I think you appreciate and we've talked about on the call, we've been able to replace a lot of that volume through our targeted promotions, particularly as it relates to the sport bras and bralettes. The amount of direct mail volume that we're lapping is more significant in Q3 and Q4 in dollars than it was in the second quarter. But Q4, in relation to the total quarter, would be a little less than Q3. Separately, one way that we were able to drive a lot of volume, and were committed to and did drive a lot of volume in the second quarter, was clearance activity. We wanted to make sure that we ended the season clean, and particularly, as it relates to exited categories. And so that sales driver, if you will, or that source of sales that existed in the second quarter, we won't really have that opportunity in the third quarter. So able to replace some of the volume. Clearance was also a contributor in Q2. It does represent pressure in Q3 and Q4, but you should know that we're of a mindset that we're going to offset that volume, whether that's every month or every week, and the right people involved in those discussions, including Les and other leaders the business. We're working hard to replace that volume and do it in a way that's healthier for the brand and that drives trial and business in core categories."

Thanks, Paul. And in terms of the magnitude, the effect of clearance related to exits and just ensuring that we ended the spring season clean, that drag or that pressure, Paul, was the biggest impact of any of the impacts in the margin rate for Victoria's for the second quarter. The other pressure that we had -- the next biggest pressure would be related to beauty. And so as you know, we restaged what we referred to as the fantasies business last fall. We believe we improved the product quality a lot, the packaging and so on, a fair amount, which drove some increase in costs, which we were fine with. But as we've talked about previously, we needed to make some adjustment in pricing this spring to drive appropriate volume in that business. And so that combination of things, along with some use of beauty giveaways to drive business, bra business and other business, put pressure on the business. And then going the other way, which you mentioned, but not as significant as the 2 things I just called out, was the benefit of the cessation of the direct mail couponing and promotional offers. So those would be the main drivers."

But headline answer to your question, some upside related to clearance. And then I would -- the second thought I would register, I'm being repetitive, but it's a theme through the dialogue, is that we drove some good volume in some of these emerging trends in the bra business. So the bralette business and the sport business were very healthy for us and good growth in the second quarter. And the panty business, we've got some good results there as well. So that's what I would call out. And PINK continued to have a very nice business in the second quarter as well.

But what they're most focused on is product quality and speed. They do manage cost, but no big changes. With respect to wage inflation, we are seeing that more in the United States, which is, at the end the day, probably a good thing. As you know from prior conversations we've had, we want to make sure that we're attracting and retaining terrific associates, whether it's at the store level, in our distribution centers, in our home office. And so we're not looking to be the low-cost player in those spaces either. We're looking to pay for terrific people, ensure that we're getting productivity from those people in terms of sales productivity in stores or other forms of productivity in other parts of our business. But in terms of cost pressures, the wage piece is affecting store selling. But as you again heard us talk about over time, we believe that through sales growth and other levers that can come from more productive store associates, we don't -- we believe that we shouldn't have, over time, significant deleverage in store selling costs. Lastly, you mentioned the catalog. We did cease producing the catalog this spring. A big cost in our business. I think, as part of that, you're asking, are there going to be changes in marketing at Victoria's Secret? There already have been and I'm sure there will continue to be more. And so -- and I don't mean that in an unsettling way, but that's just the dynamic aspect of our business. And we've made some good progress in marketing in the second quarter, but there will be more change in fall. And I'm sure there'll be more change in 2017."

We don't have a point of view, Lindsay, that the core bra business, Victoria's is ""getting worse"" by any stretch. I would say what our guidance reflects. And again, this is dynamic, and we manage it week to week and month to month, is the balance between driving trial and volume, particularly in these 2 new categories of bras that we've talked a lot about, sport bras and bralettes, and balancing that trial and margin pressure -- margin rate pressure with growth in those categories. As you point out, the beauty pressure will diminish, and that will be a benefit in Q4. But just as we laid out a view -- and we're going to work hard to beat this view, obviously, trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that we end the season with clean inventory and really striking a good balance between sales growth and rate. And so as we add that up, there is some -- a little bit of improvement, slight improvement versus the third quarter, but still pretty dynamic in trading those factors off. And again, trying to take a conservative point of view about the rate. And we'll work hard to beat that and will see if we can."

But in terms of offsets, number one is we're looking to drive accelerated growth in other categories; and number two, as you're familiar with and we've talked about before, we took a fair amount of expense out of the business. So pretty meaningful reduction in expenses related to the catalog at Victoria's Secret Direct, a reduction in overhead at Victoria's Secret and rationalization of some other marketing activity at Victoria's Secret. And so working hard to drive volume in core categories and existing businesses to offset that sales pressure and again, took a meaningful expense out of the business as part of the changes that we began implementing in the spring season of this -- of 2016. So a big offset is on the cost side of the business."

So that pressure is a little greater for Victoria's in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter. So that's really the delta that you're asking about or observing in the comp question that you asked. As it relates to special dividend and return of cash, you've also been following us a long, long time. You know what our point of view is about that, which is it's a very important source of return for shareholders and one that we're deeply committed to in a balanced approach between regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases, particularly as it relates to operating cash flow and CapEx and minimum cash levels. We earn a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter, as you know. We generate a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter. And we'll have the right discussions, as we always do, with our board and work to strike the right balance between a lot of interest. And you should know that the planning of any of this stuff, including CapEx, is dynamic. And so we regularly review the performance of our business and make judgments about how to best balance reinvestment in the business, and the results have been very strong to date based on that reinvestment in real estate with IRRs of 20%, 25% or better for both Victoria's and Bath & Body.
And that's where the substantial majority of the CapEx is going. But we also take very seriously managing the business appropriately to ensure that we always have to the right cash and liquidity in the business. We've got a strong balance sheet and a very good maturity profile in our debt and a $1 billion revolver, et cetera. But it's dynamic.

So we have made some clear decisions to eliminate or reduce broad-based promotions like the free panty and $10 off of bra promotion that drove a lot of activity in the history of the business. Obviously, made an important change in terms of the market advertising of the business. You put them in promotion as well grown how we communicate with customers with respect to the catalog, has made very good progress on driving trial through pricing and promotion in sport bras, bralettes and certain of the Victoria's Secret Beauty categories. But it's a big subject, as you're aware. And how do you think about loyalty in loyalty programs, how do you think about proprietary credit? How do you think about the best ways to communicate with customers over time. These various promotional ideas. And I think -- and others, more heavily involved in this, but I'm involved in it point I think we're still relatively early on. And as I think about that, I think that suggests a lot of opportunity for the business. So that would be my sense on that. In terms of some other things that can offset some of the drag, the most important thing for a business like ours, whether it's Victoria's or Bath & Body or [indiscernible], La Senza or any of them is have a great merchandise. They have a very quick point of view of a customers and they have out compelling regular flow of new key items that the just got to have. So that's the most important thing, and we've got a lot of talented people working that on all the major characters of the business at Victoria's. And then of the other thing I would mention because we believe strongly that it is a driver in sales growth and comp growth over time is continuing to improve our in store selling and our in-store customer experience. And we've made some progress on that front that we've been talking about it, as you know, for a number of years. And we laid out our core ideas, if you will. But we would share a view that there is ongoing meaningful opportunity that drive sales growth through continued improvement in the customer experience for our business. So that's just another category of opportunity for us. And maybe lastly, and Nick spoken a lot about this, but in the corollary exist at Victoria's as well, when you get the store environment, and Nick talked about the result of a remodel Bath & Body and Victoria's has some pretty compelling store designs, that aspect of the experience is also very powerful in these categories and another driver of sales growth in these businesses."

We believe we have a lot of sales growth opportunity with the traffic that we have, if you will, with the steady state, amount of traffic even a strong as our conversion rates are. And I think they're among the best in specialty retail. The fact is there are a lot of people that come into our stores that, for whatever reason, we're not able to convert to buyers. And again, our conversion rates are very high. But there's more that we can do with the traffic that we have. So I would start there. Separately, promotionals strategies are about striking balance in a number of fronts and certainly, can and do drive traffic into the store. And through some of the promotional changes that we've implemented at Victoria's, we're continuing to evaluate the interplay between driving trial in key categories and the dynamic you're asking about, which is driving incremental traffic into the store. And I think we're learning more about that. And again, we'll seek to strike the right balance. But the most important thing, as it relates to promotional strategies, is to do things that are healthy for the brand and don't damage the brand over time. But a lot of balances to strike in the short term. With respect to digital, Oliver, in terms of like what's going to be new or different. As you know, you've got terrific digital businesses. The growth for both Victoria's, and Nick can comment about BPL, is very, very strong.
The biggest opportunity for us in digital beyond continuing to grow the existing platforms well that are primarily focused on North America is really go after the region national opportunity for digital. So as opposed to 1 or 2 additional features for consumer experience, the big opportunity for us in digital beyond what we're already doing is to more aggressively go after that business outside of North America."

While we delivered third quarter earnings results that were within our beginning-of-quarter guidance, we're not satisfied with our overall results. Third quarter EPS declined 24% to $0.42. PINK and Bath & Body Works continue to deliver strong results, and the Victoria's Secret business continues to face headwinds related to changes we implemented in the business earlier this year. Results also reflect about $0.09 of pressure related to our investment in China; the Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue flagship store; higher net nonoperating expense, principally interest; and FX. 
The changes we've made within the Victoria's Secret business were proactive, deliver changes that will result in a more streamlined and efficient organization and will accelerate growth in our core categories. We made progress in the quarter on the implementation of these changes, combining our store and direct channels, clearing through merchandise in the exited categories of swim and apparel and making changes to our promotional approach. Our brands are strong, and we are energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to satisfy customers and maximize profitability. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

And in addition to an EPS range that you guys are focused on, understandably, we're trying to make sure that within our thinking is a conservative mindset so that we manage inventories and other aspects of our business appropriately if we end up at the lower end of a range of outcomes. So it's a big quarter, obviously. A lot to play for. We believe we have good plans for the quarter consistent with how we think about the business and run the business. We will read, react and adjust week to week and in some cases, day to day depending upon what we're seeing. And the results of various tests that we always run, that we do have a little bit wider range than we've had in the last few years, reflecting fundamentally a little less predictability given the number of changes at Victoria's Secret. With respect to the legal matters that we -- or expenses that we referenced in our precirculated commentary, those -- we would expect that those would not be of an ongoing nature.

Based on what I see today and what we -- what our thinking is at this point, I wouldn't see meaningful incremental borrowing in 2017, so shouldn't be any additional interest drag, which we had some of this year. So the VS pressure will be there for the first half of '17, some ongoing drag from China, but -- in the first part of the year, but that -- we'll lap that pretty quickly in '17.

As you point out, the beauty pressure will diminish, and that will be a benefit in Q4. But just as we laid out a view -- and we're going to work hard to beat this view, obviously, trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that we end the season with clean inventory and really striking a good balance between sales growth and rate.

As it relates to special dividend and return of cash, you've also been following us a long, long time. You know what our point of view is about that, which is it's a very important source of return for shareholders and one that we're deeply committed to in a balanced approach between regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases, particularly as it relates to operating cash flow and CapEx and minimum cash levels. We earn a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter, as you know. We generate a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter. And we'll have the right discussions, as we always do, with our board and work to strike the right balance between a lot of interest. And you should know that the planning of any of this stuff, including CapEx, is dynamic. And so we regularly review the performance of our business and make judgments about how to best balance reinvestment in the business, and the results have been very strong to date based on that reinvestment in real estate with IRRs of 20%, 25% or better for both Victoria's and Bath & Body.
And that's where the substantial majority of the CapEx is going. But we also take very seriously managing the business appropriately to ensure that we always have to the right cash and liquidity in the business. We've got a strong balance sheet and a very good maturity profile in our debt and a $1 billion revolver, et cetera. But it's dynamic. And a lot of cash generated in the fourth quarter, and we'll have the right discussions with our board as we go through the fourth quarter."

So we have made some clear decisions to eliminate or reduce broad-based promotions like the free panty and $10 off a bra promotion that drove a lot of activity in the history of the business. Obviously, made an important change in terms of -- the marketing advertising of the business you put in promotion as well around how we communicate with customers with respect to the catalog have made very good progress on driving trial through pricing and promotion in sport bras, bralettes and certain of the Victoria's Secret Beauty categories. But it's a big subject, as you're aware. And how do you think about loyalty and loyalty programs, how do you think about proprietary credit, how do you think about the best ways to communicate with customers over time, these various promotional ideas. And I think -- and others are more heavily involved in this, but I'm involved in it. I think we're still relatively early on. And as I think about that, I think that suggests a lot of opportunity for the business. So that would be my sense on that. In terms of some other things that can offset some of the drag, the most important thing for a business like ours, whether it's Victoria's or Bath & Body or Bendel or La Senza, any of them, is to have great merchandise. They have a very clear point of view about customer and to have compelling regular flow of new key items that -- where she says, ""I just got to have that."" So that's the most important thing, and we got a lot of talented people working on that and all the major categories of the business at Victoria's. And then the other thing I would mention because we believe strongly that it is a driver of sales growth and comp growth over time is continuing to improve our in-store selling and our in-store customer experience. And we've made some progress on that front. We've been talking about it, as you know, for a number of years. And we laid out our core ideas, if you will. But we would share a view that there is ongoing meaningful opportunity to drive sales growth through continued improvement in the customer experience for our business. So that's just another category of opportunity for us. And maybe lastly, and Nick has spoken a lot about this, but the corollary exists at Victoria's as well. When you get the store environment right, and Nick has talked about the result of a remodeled Bath & Body, and Victoria's has some pretty compelling store designs, that aspect of the experience is also very powerful in these categories and another driver of sales growth in these businesses."

And as you appreciate, Oliver, a lot of things drive traffic. And I -- we even start with, we believe -- and I'm not trying to avoid your question, I'll get to it, but just trying to show you how we think. We believe we have a lot of sales growth opportunity with the traffic that we have, if you will, with the steady state amount of traffic even as strong as our conversion rates are. And I think they're among the best in specialty retail. The fact is there are a lot of people that come into our stores that, for whatever reason, we're not able to convert to buyers. And again, our conversion rates are very high. But there's more that we can do with the traffic that we have. So I would start there. Separately, promotional strategies are about striking balance on a number of fronts and certainly, can and do drive traffic into the store. And through some of the promotional changes that we've implemented at Victoria's, we're continuing to evaluate the interplay between driving trial in key categories and the dynamic you're asking about, which is driving incremental traffic into the store. And I think we're learning more about that. And again, we'll seek to strike the right balance. But the most important thing as it relates to promotional strategies is to do things that are healthy for the brand and don't damage the brand over time. But a lot of balances to strike in the short term. With respect to digital, Oliver, in terms of like what's going to be new or different, as you know, we've got terrific digital businesses. The growth for both Victoria's, and Nick can comment about BBW, very, very strong. The biggest opportunity for us in digital beyond continuing to grow the existing platforms well in -- that are primarily focused on North America is to really go after the international opportunity for digital. So as opposed to 1 or 2 additional features for consumer experience, the big opportunity for us in digital beyond what we're already doing is to more aggressively go after that business outside of North America."

We drove a lot of unit volume growth, a lot of trial in those segments. And for that reason, pretty pleased with the result. What our company has been able to do pretty consistently over a long period of time is to get to a margin rate and an overall margin architecture that works well for the business over time. And I can think of numerous examples in the business over the years, including a PINK business 5 or 7 years ago that didn't have the same margin rate as the core lingerie business in Victoria's, where through understanding the customer well, great delivery of newness and fashion and leveraging read/react capabilities and speed, we've been able to strike a right balance, an appropriate balance between dollar growth, dollar results and rate. And so we're pleased with our growth, extraordinary growth, frankly, in the bralette and sport bra business intentionally driving trial and unit growth. And as I've mentioned, we're confident that over time, we'll get the right balance as it relates to dollar growth and rate in those categories and in the overall bra business for Victoria's."

And in addition to an EPS range that you guys are focused on, understandably, we're trying to make sure that within our thinking is a conservative mindset so that we manage inventories and other aspects of our business appropriately if we end up at the lower end of a range of outcomes. So it's a big quarter, obviously. A lot to play for. We believe we have good plans for the quarter consistent with how we think about the business and run the business. We will read, react and adjust week to week and in some cases, day to day depending upon what we're seeing. And the results of various tests that we always run, that we do have a little bit wider range than we've had in the last few years, reflecting fundamentally a little less predictability given the number of changes at Victoria's Secret. With respect to the legal matters that we -- or expenses that we referenced in our precirculated commentary, those -- we would expect that those would not be of an ongoing nature.

The driver or the impact from China, we would expect, will decline in 2017 versus the impact in 2016. Fifth Avenue, obviously, was a unique situation, so that should not recur. Based on what I see today and what we -- what our thinking is at this point, I wouldn't see meaningful incremental borrowing in 2017, so shouldn't be any additional interest drag, which we had some of this year. So the VS pressure will be there for the first half of '17, some ongoing drag from China, but -- in the first part of the year, but that -- we'll lap that pretty quickly in '17.

So can you -- as you think about 4Q and why the outlook for margins isn't a little bit better certainly versus what we contemplated even exiting the second quarter, what are the factors that are sustaining that pressure despite some of the things that I highlighted that might be along for some improvement?

As you point out, the beauty pressure will diminish, and that will be a benefit in Q4. But just as we laid out a view -- and we're going to work hard to beat this view, obviously, trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that we end the season with clean inventory and really striking a good balance between sales growth and rate. And so as we add that up, there is some -- a little bit of improvement, slight improvement versus the third quarter, but still pretty dynamic in trading those factors off.

So we have made some clear decisions to eliminate or reduce broad-based promotions like the free panty and $10 off a bra promotion that drove a lot of activity in the history of the business. Obviously, made an important change in terms of -- the marketing advertising of the business you put in promotion as well around how we communicate with customers with respect to the catalog have made very good progress on driving trial through pricing and promotion in sport bras, bralettes and certain of the Victoria's Secret Beauty categories. But it's a big subject, as you're aware. And how do you think about loyalty and loyalty programs, how do you think about proprietary credit, how do you think about the best ways to communicate with customers over time, these various promotional ideas. And I think -- and others are more heavily involved in this, but I'm involved in it. I think we're still relatively early on. And as I think about that, I think that suggests a lot of opportunity for the business. So that would be my sense on that. In terms of some other things that can offset some of the drag, the most important thing for a business like ours, whether it's Victoria's or Bath & Body or Bendel or La Senza, any of them, is to have great merchandise. They have a very clear point of view about customer and to have compelling regular flow of new key items that -- where she says, ""I just got to have that."" So that's the most important thing, and we got a lot of talented people working on that and all the major categories of the business at Victoria's. And then the other thing I would mention because we believe strongly that it is a driver of sales growth and comp growth over time is continuing to improve our in-store selling and our in-store customer experience. And we've made some progress on that front. We've been talking about it, as you know, for a number of years. And we laid out our core ideas, if you will. But we would share a view that there is ongoing meaningful opportunity to drive sales growth through continued improvement in the customer experience for our business. So that's just another category of opportunity for us. And maybe lastly, and Nick has spoken a lot about this, but the corollary exists at Victoria's as well. When you get the store environment right, and Nick has talked about the result of a remodeled Bath & Body, and Victoria's has some pretty compelling store designs, that aspect of the experience is also very powerful in these categories and another driver of sales growth in these businesses."

And as you appreciate, Oliver, a lot of things drive traffic. And I -- we even start with, we believe -- and I'm not trying to avoid your question, I'll get to it, but just trying to share with you how we think. We believe we have a lot of sales growth opportunity with the traffic that we have, if you will, with the steady state amount of traffic even as strong as our conversion rates are. And I think they're among the best in specialty retail. The fact is there are a lot of people that come into our stores that, for whatever reason, we're not able to convert to buyers. And again, our conversion rates are very high. But there's more that we can do with the traffic that we have. So I would start there. Separately, promotional strategies are about striking balance on a number of fronts and certainly, can and do drive traffic into the store. And through some of the promotional changes that we've implemented at Victoria's, we're continuing to evaluate the interplay between driving trial in key categories and the dynamic you're asking about, which is driving incremental traffic into the store. And I think we're learning more about that. And again, we'll seek to strike the right balance. But the most important thing as it relates to promotional strategies is to do things that are healthy for the brand and don't damage the brand over time. But a lot of balances to strike in the short term. With respect to digital, Oliver, in terms of like what's going to be new or different, as you know, we've got terrific digital businesses. The growth for both Victoria's, and Nick can comment about BBW, very, very strong. The biggest opportunity for us in digital beyond continuing to grow the existing platforms well in -- that are primarily focused on North America is to really go after the international opportunity for digital. So as opposed to 1 or 2 additional features for consumer experience, the big opportunity for us in digital beyond what we're already doing is to more aggressively go after that business outside of North America."

So I don't know if you have that level of detail with you, but I'm just wondering, what of the -- what are the pieces that were headwinds in 2016 that go away in 2017? And what were the headwinds in 2016 that you expect to continue going forward?"

So there will be pressure from the changes at Victoria's Secret, as I've commented on at our Investor Day that continue into the first half of 2017. And the specifics of that, we'll provide the best update that we can, Kimberly, in February when we give our guidance for 2017. The driver or the impact from China, we would expect, will decline in 2017 versus the impact in 2016. Fifth Avenue, obviously, was a unique situation, so that should not recur. Based on what I see today and what we -- what our thinking is at this point, I wouldn't see meaningful incremental borrowing in 2017, so shouldn't be any additional interest drag, which we had some of this year. So the VS pressure will be there for the first half of '17, some ongoing drag from China, but -- in the first part of the year, but that -- we'll lap that pretty quickly in '17. In terms of capital structure, it shouldn't be anything meaningful based on what we know at this point. So hopefully, that gives you some flavor for it as -- and you've following us for a long time. As you know, we'll do a lot of work after we get through this fourth quarter, which, again, is about 50% of the year, tightening up our views and frankly, also making operating decisions based on our results as we really get ready for 2017. But broad brush, that's how we'd see it at this point. Thanks."

And it seems as if you have some factors that should actually sequentially be helping you in 4Q, whether it's opening the New York City flagship or lapping the beauty relaunch and also, maybe some of the progress you've made in clearing out some of the excess inventory in structured bras that had been an overhang. So can you -- as you think about 4Q and why the outlook for margins isn't a little bit better certainly versus what we contemplated even exiting the second quarter, what are the factors that are sustaining that pressure despite some of the things that I highlighted that might be along for some improvement? Is the structured bra business or the Victoria's business, the core business, is any aspect of that getting worse versus 3Q? Or maybe just helping me square those numbers."

We don't have a point of view, Lindsay, that the core bra business, Victoria's is ""getting worse"" by any stretch. I would say what our guidance reflects. And again, this is dynamic, and we manage it week to week and month to month, is the balance between driving trial and volume, particularly in these 2 new categories of bras that we've talked a lot about, sport bras and bralettes, and balancing that trial and margin pressure -- margin rate pressure with growth in those categories. As you point out, the beauty pressure will diminish, and that will be a benefit in Q4. But just as we laid out a view -- and we're going to work hard to beat this view, obviously, trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that we end the season with clean inventory and really striking a good balance between sales growth and rate. And so as we add that up, there is some -- a little bit of improvement, slight improvement versus the third quarter, but still pretty dynamic in trading those factors off.

So pretty meaningful reduction in expenses related to the catalog at Victoria's Secret Direct, a reduction in overhead at Victoria's Secret and rationalization of some other marketing activity at Victoria's Secret. And so working hard to drive volume in core categories and existing businesses to offset that sales pressure and again, took a meaningful expense out of the business as part of the changes that we began implementing in the spring season of this -- of 2016.

You know what our point of view is about that, which is it's a very important source of return for shareholders and one that we're deeply committed to in a balanced approach between regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases, particularly as it relates to operating cash flow and CapEx and minimum cash levels. We earn a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter, as you know. We generate a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter. And we'll have the right discussions, as we always do, with our board and work to strike the right balance between a lot of interest. And you should know that the planning of any of this stuff, including CapEx, is dynamic. And so we regularly review the performance of our business and make judgments about how to best balance reinvestment in the business, and the results have been very strong to date based on that reinvestment in real estate with IRRs of 20%, 25% or better for both Victoria's and Bath & Body.
And that's where the substantial majority of the CapEx is going. But we also take very seriously managing the business appropriately to ensure that we always have to the right cash and liquidity in the business. We've got a strong balance sheet and a very good maturity profile in our debt and a $1 billion revolver, et cetera. But it's dynamic.

So we have made some clear decisions to eliminate or reduce broad-based promotions like the free panty and $10 off a bra promotion that drove a lot of activity in the history of the business. Obviously, made an important change in terms of -- the marketing advertising of the business you put in promotion as well around how we communicate with customers with respect to the catalog have made very good progress on driving trial through pricing and promotion in sport bras, bralettes and certain of the Victoria's Secret Beauty categories. But it's a big subject, as you're aware. And how do you think about loyalty and loyalty programs, how do you think about proprietary credit, how do you think about the best ways to communicate with customers over time, these various promotional ideas. And I think -- and others are more heavily involved in this, but I'm involved in it. I think we're still relatively early on. And as I think about that, I think that suggests a lot of opportunity for the business. So that would be my sense on that. In terms of some other things that can offset some of the drag, the most important thing for a business like ours, whether it's Victoria's or Bath & Body or Bendel or La Senza, any of them, is to have great merchandise. They have a very clear point of view about customer and to have compelling regular flow of new key items that -- where she says, ""I just got to have that."" So that's the most important thing, and we got a lot of talented people working on that and all the major categories of the business at Victoria's. And then the other thing I would mention because we believe strongly that it is a driver of sales growth and comp growth over time is continuing to improve our in-store selling and our in-store customer experience. And we've made some progress on that front. We've been talking about it, as you know, for a number of years. And we laid out our core ideas, if you will. But we would share a view that there is ongoing meaningful opportunity to drive sales growth through continued improvement in the customer experience for our business. So that's just another category of opportunity for us. And maybe lastly, and Nick has spoken a lot about this, but the corollary exists at Victoria's as well. When you get the store environment right, and Nick has talked about the result of a remodeled Bath & Body, and Victoria's has some pretty compelling store designs, that aspect of the experience is also very powerful in these categories and another driver of sales growth in these businesses."

And I -- we even start with, we believe -- and I'm not trying to avoid your question, I'll get to it, but just trying to share with you how we think. We believe we have a lot of sales growth opportunity with the traffic that we have, if you will, with the steady state amount of traffic even as strong as our conversion rates are. And I think they're among the best in specialty retail. The fact is there are a lot of people that come into our stores that, for whatever reason, we're not able to convert to buyers. And again, our conversion rates are very high. But there's more that we can do with the traffic that we have. So I would start there. Separately, promotional strategies are about striking balance on a number of fronts and certainly, can and do drive traffic into the store. And through some of the promotional changes that we've implemented at Victoria's, we're continuing to evaluate the interplay between driving trial in key categories and the dynamic you're asking about, which is driving incremental traffic into the store. And I think we're learning more about that. And again, we'll seek to strike the right balance. But the most important thing as it relates to promotional strategies is to do things that are healthy for the brand and don't damage the brand over time. But a lot of balances to strike in the short term. With respect to digital, Oliver, in terms of like what's going to be new or different, as you know, we've got terrific digital businesses. The growth for both Victoria's, and Nick can comment about BBW, very, very strong.

And on the assumption that we fundamentally have the identical assortments online and in stores and the identical pricing strategy, that allows us to really go back to basics, which is the #1 goal for us online is to be able to market the brand, drive traffic, use it for storytelling and really use it for launching an information sharing of new products, especially if you go back to the beginning, which is we're trying to continue to evolve this brand. That doesn't negate our responsibility to figure out how to grow the business. And as you've been able to see, we've continued to see very, very healthy growth in there and will continue to invest in different formats, different models and different testing to ensure that we can do both of those. So it's a really important channel, but it's very much a complementary channel and very much used to market the brand."

Results also reflect about $0.09 of pressure related to our investment in China; the Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue flagship store; higher net nonoperating expense, principally interest; and FX. 
The changes we've made within the Victoria's Secret business were proactive, delivery changes that will result in a more streamlined and efficient organization and will accelerate growth in our core categories. We made progress in the quarter on the implementation of these changes, combining our store and direct channels, clearing through merchandise in the exited categories of swim and apparel and making changes to our promotional approach. Our brands are strong, and we are energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to satisfy customers and maximize profitability.

We will read, react and adjust week to week and in some cases, day to day depending upon what we're seeing.

Based on what I see today and what we -- what our thinking is at this point, I wouldn't see meaningful incremental borrowing in 2017, so shouldn't be any additional interest drag, which we had some of this year. So the VS pressure will be there for the first half of '17, some ongoing drag from China, but -- in the first part of the year, but that -- we'll lap that pretty quickly in '17.

As you point out, the beauty pressure will diminish, and that will be a benefit in Q4.

Total bra and panty sales declined a little bit year-over-year. I think that's driven by AUR. So when you look at the business and consider the growth of the underlying cost in the bralette, should we think that -- along with the sport bra business, should we think that the AUR declines that you're seeing could prevail? Or do you think that this higher AUR structured bra business can gain some momentum as we go through the fourth quarter next year?"

I mean, I would just start with the fact that the bra business is absolutely core to Victoria's Secret. And a growing, healthy, very strong margin dollar growth, bra business is among our highest priorities in our company. And so knowing that, just -- you should know how we think about it, its importance, and what we'll be working towards. There have been some important shifts in merchandise categories. But one of the other benefits is we have -- that offset, at least in part, the lower AURs related to the sport bras and bralettes is we were doing a lot of those $10 off a bra promotions that, as you know, we have stopped doing. And so the timing and specifics of when do we get to meaningful dollar growth in the bra business and the outcomes that are so important to us, we're working through some significant transitions right now. But we're very clear minded about what the goals are, and that's on the line point of view through the organization. And at the end of the day, I'm highly confident that we'll achieve that outcome. But it's a little dynamic right now based on some of the changes in the merchandise assortment and the proactive changes that we've made."

So that pressure is a little greater for Victoria's in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter. So that's really the delta that you're asking about or observing in the comp question that you asked. As it relates to special dividend and return of cash, you've also been following us a long, long time. You know what our point of view is about that, which is it's a very important source of return for shareholders and one that we're deeply committed to in a balanced approach between regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases, particularly as it relates to operating cash flow and CapEx and minimum cash levels. We earn a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter, as you know. We generate a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter. And we'll have the right discussions, as we always do, with our board and work to strike the right balance between a lot of interest. And you should know that the planning of any of this stuff, including CapEx, is dynamic. And so we regularly review the performance of our business and make judgments about how to best balance reinvestment in the business, and the results have been very strong to date based on that reinvestment in real estate with IRRs of 20%, 25% or better for both Victoria's and Bath & Body.
And that's where the substantial majority of the CapEx is going. But we also take very seriously managing the business appropriately to ensure that we always have to the right cash and liquidity in the business. We've got a strong balance sheet and a very good maturity profile in our debt and a $1 billion revolver, et cetera. But it's dynamic. And a lot of cash generated in the fourth quarter, and we'll have the right discussions with our board as we go through the fourth quarter."

So we have made some clear decisions to eliminate or reduce broad-based promotions like the free panty and $10 off a bra promotion that drove a lot of activity in the history of the business. Obviously, made an important change in terms of -- the marketing advertising of the business you put in promotion as well around how we communicate with customers with respect to the catalog have made very good progress on driving trial through pricing and promotion in sport bras, bralettes and certain of the Victoria's Secret Beauty categories. But it's a big subject, as you're aware. And how do you think about loyalty and loyalty programs, how do you think about proprietary credit, how do you think about the best ways to communicate with customers over time, these various promotional ideas. And I think -- and others are more heavily involved in this, but I'm involved in it. I think we're still relatively early on. And as I think about that, I think that suggests a lot of opportunity for the business. So that would be my sense on that. In terms of some other things that can offset some of the drag, the most important thing for a business like ours, whether it's Victoria's or Bath & Body or Bendel or La Senza, any of them, is to have great merchandise. They have a very clear point of view about customer and to have compelling regular flow of new key items that -- where she says, ""I just got to have that."" So that's the most important thing, and we got a lot of talented people working on that and all the major categories of the business at Victoria's. And then the other thing I would mention because we believe strongly that it is a driver of sales growth and comp growth over time is continuing to improve our in-store selling and our in-store customer experience. And we've made some progress on that front. We've been talking about it, as you know, for a number of years. And we laid out our core ideas, if you will. But we would share a view that there is ongoing meaningful opportunity to drive sales growth through continued improvement in the customer experience for our business. So that's just another category of opportunity for us. And maybe lastly, and Nick has spoken a lot about this, but the corollary exists at Victoria's as well. When you get the store environment right, and Nick has talked about the result of a remodeled Bath & Body, and Victoria's has some pretty compelling store designs, that aspect of the experience is also very powerful in these categories and another driver of sales growth in these businesses."

And as you appreciate, Oliver, a lot of things drive traffic. And I -- we even start with, we believe -- and I'm not trying to avoid your question, I'll get to it, but just trying to share with you how we think. We believe we have a lot of sales growth opportunity with the traffic that we have, if you will, with the steady state amount of traffic even as strong as our conversion rates are. And I think they're among the best in specialty retail. The fact is there are a lot of people that come into our stores that, for whatever reason, we're not able to convert to buyers. And again, our conversion rates are very high. But there's more that we can do with the traffic that we have. So I would start there. Separately, promotional strategies are about striking balance on a number of fronts and certainly, can and do drive traffic into the store. And through some of the promotional changes that we've implemented at Victoria's, we're continuing to evaluate the interplay between driving trial in key categories and the dynamic you're asking about, which is driving incremental traffic into the store. And I think we're learning more about that. And again, we'll seek to strike the right balance. But the most important thing as it relates to promotional strategies is to do things that are healthy for the brand and don't damage the brand over time. But a lot of balances to strike in the short term. With respect to digital, Oliver, in terms of like what's going to be new or different, as you know, we've got terrific digital businesses. The growth for both Victoria's, and Nick can comment about BBW, very, very strong. The biggest opportunity for us in digital beyond continuing to grow the existing platforms well in -- that are primarily focused on North America is to really go after the international opportunity for digital. So as opposed to 1 or 2 additional features for consumer experience, the big opportunity for us in digital beyond what we're already doing is to more aggressively go after that business outside of North America."
