I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with a review of our performance in 2015",564,"Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with a review of our performance in 2015 as a whole in addition to providing some forward-looking perspectives.
We delivered solid results this quarter, which is a direct result of the focus we've maintained on executing our primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing capital return to shareholders. 
For the fourth quarter, we recorded $0.91 of earnings per share, which included $0.03 of discrete tax benefits. When adjusting for noncore items, earnings per share were stable compared with prior quarter and the prior year. Continued improvement in net interest income this quarter was offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of challenging market conditions in addition to normal quarterly variability. Capital markets related to income was in line with the prior quarter as the slowdown in fixed income markets was offset by higher equity origination fees and trading income, the latter, which was a result of increased client-driven interest rate hedging activities. 
Overall, we're successfully deepening client relationships within our Wholesale Banking platform and benefiting from our diverse business mix and breadth of capabilities. We achieved our goal of attaining a sub-63% efficiency ratio and ended the year with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 62.7%, 24 basis points better than 2014. 
Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving our long-term goal of the being sub-60% while we continue to diligently manage expenses while also investing in a strategic revenue-generating initiatives throughout the company. We continue to see the benefits of our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts, which drove a 4 basis point improvement in our net interest margin and a $34 million increase in net interest income. This is further realization of a positive shift in our overall earning asset and funding mix.
Average loans were up 2% compared to the third quarter, driven by growth across most sectors, including commercial, consumer direct and residential markets. While loan growth will ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident in our ability to generate growth in segments where returns are appropriate and we can have deeper relationships. However, we are closely manage areas that don't meet those thresholds. 
Average deposits were also up 2%, which is further evidence of the success we're having in deepening client relationships across the company. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability, the latter of which is evidenced by the 35% reduction in long-term debts over the past year. The overall asset quality remains favorable. However, we did see an increase in nonperforming loans as a result of deterioration in our energy-related exposure, which Aleem will provide details on later. Provision expense was a less impacted as we've been building reserves in the previous quarters. The net charge-off ratio was 24 basis points, a strong result but likely unsustainable long term. Lastly, our capital position continues to be strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis.
So with that as a brief overview I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the quarters performance."

Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before I jump into the details, I'd like to call your attention to a new table we're presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past 5 quarters and will help you analyze our financial performance in an efficient manner. As it is year end, we've added this slide to the main presentation and going forward, you'll find this in the appendix. 
Moving to Slide 5, you can see the net interest margin improved by 4 basis points, driven by higher security deals as a result of slower prepayment speeds, further low-cost deposit growth and lower long-term debt, as we received a full quarter benefit of the $1.7 billion debt reduction in the third quarter. Net interest income increased $34 million sequentially, driven by solid 2% loan and deposit growth and the 4 basis points improvement in NIM. As a result of our activity balance sheet management efforts, overall net interest income has been higher since the first quarter, which we had anticipated would be the trough. For the full year, net interest income declined at 2% entirely due to a decline in commercial loan swap income as a result of lower fixed rates. In 2016, commercial loan swap income will decline modestly relative to 2015, largely due to anticipated increase in LIBOR, which would be more than offset by higher net interest income from the core asset sensitivity of the balance sheet.
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter net interest margin to improve further 3 to 5 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. From there, NIM will likely be relatively stable for the remainder of 2016, assuming we only get one additional increase in the federal bonds rate.
We have been and we'll continue to carefully manage the generation of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also insurance our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income declined $32 million sequentially, primarily driven by asset disposition gains in the third quarter and lower Wealth Management-related revenue in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in markets related income.
Wealth Management-related revenue declined to $13 million sequentially, partially due to seasonal trust fees typically earned in the third quarter, but also should to market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. Investment banking income declined $11 million as fixed income originations were negatively impacted by challenging market conditions. Equity originations and M&A, however, remained relatively strong, which is a reflection of the strategic capabilities that we have expanded over the past few years.
Trading income increased $11 million, driven by higher derivative marketing revenue as commercial clients increased their utilization of interest rate swaps to hedge potential changes in rates. Mortgage servicing income improved by $16 million due to higher servicing fees, some of which is seasonal, lower decay expense and better hedge performance. Mortgage production income declined $5 million as lower production was generally offset by improved channel mix.
Service charges on deposits continue to steadily decline, a reflection of the increased transparency and the technology we are providing our clients so they can manage their accounts more effectively. This decline will continue in 2016 in part of driven by enhancements to our hosting ordering process, which once fully implemented will help our clients save more money and reduce our service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter. This transition will occur in the second half of 2016. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, noninterest income was down 4%, driven by declines across most categories, largely due to the challenging market conditions experienced in the second half of 2015. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $35 million sequentially, almost entirely due to $32 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the previous quarter related to the successful resolution of the print reviews mortgage matters. Outside processing and software costs were up $22 million due to higher utilization of certain third-party services in addition to normal quarterly variability. Amortization expense increased by $8 million, similar to last year's increase, as we invested additional capital in low income communities, which was generally offset by a correspondingly lower provision taxes. 
Offsetting these increases was a $35 million declined and personnel costs, driven primarily by lower accruals, uncertain incentive and medical costs as we calibrated expenses to actual performance. While quarterly incentive and benefits cost can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2015, which is consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, driven by a combination of higher personnel expense and outside processing and software costs. For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 1% compared to 2014 and have declined each of the past 4 years. In fact, adjusted expenses are down 15% since 2011, evidence of our efforts to operate more efficiently. Separately, while not a noninterest expense point, I will highlight that the discrete tax benefits we recognized in 2015 resulted in an effective tax rate of 28% for the full year, which is below what we would consider a more normal range in the low 30s. 
As we look to the first quarter of this year, we anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses and also a return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefit costs. In addition, our marketing and customer development costs will weigh more heavily in the first half of the year versus the second half as we're introducing a new campaign to further advance our purposes the company. 
Bigger picture, after 4 consecutive years of declines, we expect 2016 expenses to be higher than 2015 as we expect revenues to improve. We will maintain our focus on the efficiency ratio and if revenues do not materialize, we will have to adjust our explain expense base accordingly. As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.2% in the fourth quarter, up slightly over the prior quarter and year. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.7%, better than our 2015 target and 24 basis points better than 2014.
For 2016, we're targeting revenue growth that exceeds expense growth and thus, tangible efficiency ratio that improves. That being said, the pace of improvement will be significantly lower than the previous years as our core expenses have already declined substantially and the operating environment, while improving in certain areas, remains challenging overall. Nonetheless, we remain firmly committed to our long-term targets of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of a delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 9. Overall asset quality remains solid during the quarter, evidence by a 24 basis points net charge-off ratio and a 49 basis points NPL ratio. We did experience a deterioration in our energy portfolio, which when combined with the proactive NPL sales in prior quarters, resulted in an NPL ratio that was 14 basis points higher sequentially but was very much in line with last year. As it relates to energy, not much has changed with regard to our exposure and mix. The energy portfolio is 2.2% of the total loan portfolio, which is down 11% over the past year. The exploration and production and oilfield services portfolios, which are the most negatively impacted by prolonged low oil prices, represent a little under 40% of the total energy portfolio or slightly under 1% of total loans. Our reserves for the energy portfolio are approximately 4.5% and when isolated to the two most severely impacted sectors, are near 12%. In addition, total reserves of $1.8 billion have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio. Losses in the E&P and oil field services portfolios will be elevated over the next couple of years and will thus costs overall C&I loss rates to rise from their low levels today. However, given all of the factors I mentioned, we believe our energy-related risks remains very manageable in the context of the overall company. 
The provision for credit losses increased $19 million sequentially and the ALLL ratio declined 5 basis points to 1.29%, consistent with overall credit quality trends. Looking ahead, we expect nonperforming loans and net charge-offs to increase, primarily as a result of further stress in the energy portfolio. Despite this, we would still expect the company's overall net charge-off with to be less than 40 basis points in 2016. Provision expense this year will more closely match net charge-offs as the multiyear improvement in asset quality abates.
Ultimately, our results will be determined by a rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in all of our loan portfolios, combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our commercial and consumer portfolios in addition to lower levels of payoffs. Commercial loan growth was broad based and driven by corporate, commercial auto dealer and commercial real estate clients, while consumer loan growth was driven by growth in direct, indirect and guaranteed student loans. The momentum in the consumer direct portfolio continues to be strong, driven by LightStream's, our partnership with GreenSky and further success with our credit card offering. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2 billion or 2%, driven by 3% growth in C&I and 13% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, payoffs and commercial real estate and reductions in indirect consumer loans given our focus on returns. 
In total, we have proactively sold or securitized approximately $5 billion of loans since the middle of 2014. Going forward, we will periodically sell or securitize lower return loans as part of our balance sheet optimization focus, though likely not at the pace of the past 18 months. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.9 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 8% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale sectors. In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within Wholesale Banking, continue to do an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill referenced earlier, our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher cost long-term debt by $4.5 billion or 35% in just the past year. Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher-cost deposits have been gradually declining. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will reverse. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was up 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was stable sequentially and up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings, partially offset by lower AOCIs as a result of higher interest rates. 
For our 2015 capital plan, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the fourth quarter. In addition, we repurchased an incremental $39 million of common stock in December, which reflects our overall commitment to increase capital return to shareholders. We expect to repurchase approximately $350 million of additional common stock in the first half of 2016 to complete our 2015 capital plan. As a result of our capital return program, we're continuing to drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Lastly, as of January 1, the liquidity coverage ratio is now a formal requirement. We have started the year in full compliance and we'll, of course, maintain that status over the course of 2016. 
Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 13.  Net income declined 6% sequentially as elevated market volatility resulted in lower Wealth Management-related revenue. We also had a modest increase in expenses, driven in part by investments in our card offerings as well as various onetime items. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 4% annually, benefiting from continued low costs deposit growth and our balance sheet optimization efforts. The strong growth in our consumer direct portfolios has afforded us the opportunity to sell securitized or reduce production in lower return area. Deposits were up 1% sequentially and the 6% for the full year, with much of this growth coming from the deeper relationships with our mass affluent client base, aided by our investments in Premier Bankers and the SummitView platform. 
On a full year basis, CPWM posted strong net income growth of 8%, which is once again the result of strong deposit growth, our balance sheet optimization efforts and further improvements and credit quality. Loan balances declined 3% in 2015 as we sold or securitized approximately $2 billion of loans. But organic consumer nonproduction was solid and increased 5%. 
Noninterest income declined 1% for the full year, largely due to the headwinds wealth management faced in 2015 but also due to the continued decline in service charges. While current market conditions have made growing Wealth Management revenue more challenging, meeting more of our clients' wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for the company. 
Expenses in CPWM has been well controlled as we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing talent and technology. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments and expect this to increase as mobile adoption rates and digital sales trend upwards. Bigger picture, the progress we've made in optimizing balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. We're optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business, both as it executes against its strategic priorities and as the value of our strong deposit franchise is more fully realized in a normal interest rate environment.
Moving to Wholesale Banking on Slide 14. We had a solid quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions. Revenues were down 3% sequentially but stable relative to the prior year. Much of the decline in revenue was driven by overall market volatility, which not only impacted debt origination activity but also resulted in adverse mark-to-market impacts.
Partially mitigating these impacts was strength in other product areas, such as equity originations, equity sales and trading and derivatives marketing, a reflection of the increasing diversity of our business model. Net interest income was up 1% sequentially as a result of strong strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by margin compression. Overall, net income declined 9% sequentially as a result of declines in noninterest income and increased provision expense. While we have been building reserves for our energy exposure since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prolonged low oil price environment will continue to place pressure on the provision expense in this business. 
On a full year basis, we saw strong performance with a record year for wholesale bank, demonstrated by the 9% increase in net income, driven by broad-based revenue growth, partially offset by energy-related reserve increases. Net interest income was up 6%, driven by 8% loan growth and 16% deposit growth. The loan growth was broad-based across each line of business and most industry verticals, partially offset by intentional reductions in lower-return areas. The deposit momentum within this business also continues to be strong, evidence of the success our liquidity specialists within wholesale are having an the enhancements we've made to our treasury and payment product offerings. 
Noninterest income was up 10% in part due to the 14% growth in investment banking income where we had record years in equity originations, M&A, syndicated and leveraged finance and investment-grade bond originations. The breadth of growth here is reflective of the investments we've made to expand our capabilities and thus, become more of a strategic adviser to all of our wholesale clients. 
The tangible efficiency ratio improved further to 48.6% as we drove further operating leverage while also investing in revenue-generating initiatives. 
In conclusion, while market conditions can be choppy quarter-to-quarter, we're encouraged by our differentiated the business model within Wholesale Banking and are confident in the opportunities we have to expand our client base, meet more of their complex corporate finance and advisory needs and continue to grow our business.
Moving to the mortgage segment. Revenues were stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income. Net income declined $38 million as a result of the $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined by $22 million as a result of lower margins, both in production and our held-for-investment loan portfolio. These declines were partially offset by an increase in servicing income as a result of portfolio acquisitions over the past couple of years. For the full year, we saw $137 million increase in adjusted net income, which is primarily due to the significantly improved credit quality of the loan portfolio, both as a result of the improving housing market and our proactive actions to derisk the book. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in net interest income as a result of $2.3 billion of loan sales in 2014 and lower loan spreads in 2015.
Production volume increased by 38% in 2015 due primarily to higher refinancing activity. New purchase volume also improved in 2015, a broader sign of the continued improvement of the economies in our markets. We also grew the servicing portfolio by 5% as a result of portfolio acquisitions. In both production and servicing, we achieved our objectives of smart, targeted market share growth. I would also like to point out that we successfully switched to a new loan origination system in the second half of 2015, which facilitates a faster and simpler loan process for our clients and teammates but also allowed us to more efficiently meet the new requirements, which became effective October 1. This was a significant and important undertaking, and we have already been able to use our success as a competitive advantage to attract new talent in several of our markets. 
Overall, the mortgage business continues to benefit from improving asset quality and good expense discipline, both of which have allowed this business to become a more steady contributor to the bottom line performance of this company. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill to share some concluding perspectives on our performance in 2015 and our outlook for 2016."

Thanks, Aleem. So coming into last year, we have several key objectives: Continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital returns.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in 2015 as we met each of these objectives. We grew earnings per share by a solid 11%, we met our efficiency ratio goal, we increased ROI by 5 basis points and advanced the revenue growth trajectory of many businesses, all in the context of managing the headwinds associated with the prolonged low interest rate environment.
We also grew tangible book value per share by 6% and returned over 60% of our earnings back to our shareholders, continuing our path of improving capital returns. Our performance is a reflection of the diversity of our business model, where each segment made strong contributions to enhance the financial performance of our company. Within consumer and private wealth, organic production growth and higher return portfolios and continued momentum on the deposit front has allowed us to further optimize the balance sheet. Our investments in digital have allowed us to better identify and meet more client needs while also extracting efficiencies from certain areas. In wholesale, our differentiated business model allowed us to absorb the impact of the more challenging market conditions in the second half of the year and drive strong high single-digit growth in revenue and net income. In particular, I'm pleased with the more integrated One Team approach we delivered to our clients, and that's evidence by a 36% increase in capital markets revenue from the commercial real estate and private wealth businesses.
This increase in client and product diversity will be an important contributor to the long-term growth of Wholesale Banking. And within mortgage, we benefit from the abatement of legacy mortgage-related costs but also from the targeted growth initiatives we have in place to grow production in servicing. The transition to a new origination platform was time-consuming and challenging, but I believe we have the right risk and operational foundation in place to further advance over what gets business. 
So as we look into 2016, we'll remain focused on the same primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency, all with the goal of creating further value for our clients and shareholders. While the revenue environment is expected to improve, we expect critical to normalize in the nonrecurring benefits we had in 2015 will abate. Subsequently, we'll need to deliver positive operating leverage in 2016 in order to achieve our financial objectives and make further progress towards our long-term target of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. So to conclude, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our teammates for their key roles in delivering our 2015 financial results, many of them are on the phone today. Our team is diligently focused on fulfilling our purpose of widening the way to financial well-being for our clients, communities and shareholders. As we look into 2016, we'll further advance this purpose, facilitating a dialogue about money in order to help Americans moved from financial stress to control and ultimately, to confidence. Our team is absolutely ready to go. Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Ankur and we'll begin the Q&A portion."

So you know our energy exposure overall is only 2.2% of our total loan book, first of all. Secondly, within that E&P and oil field services are 40%, so only about 1% of our total loan portfolio is in those two sectors which should probably be the sectors most negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Within that, now you think about, we've got about 4.5% of reserves against the entire energy book. So for those two segments, the reserve levels are closer to 12%. So that starts to feel pretty good. And then thoroughly, of course, we've got a total of $1.8 billion of ALLL in total, which is available to cover all of our loans. So as I think about what might happen here in 2016, '17, '18, we will see some increase in NPLs. We will see some increase in provisioning against our energy portfolio. But in the context of the rest of the book, where our resi mortgage exposure continues to get better and better and as charge-off levels and required reserves continue to come down, I think that our 2016 charge-off levels and provision levels for energy actually are looking very manageable."

On the fee income side, you're right. We're not really expecting growth in consumer service charges. That's not going to be a growth area for us, but the growth that we've seen overall in wholesale will continue, I think, we'll will continue to appear.

The offset to that, so that's -- the rate hike is going to be healthful and we're asset-sensitive. And we're asset sensitive actually at every key rate duration point across the curve. So that will be helpful. The offset to that is competitive pressures are still strong. Spreads continue to be tight if anything, grinding maybe at a bit tighter but sort of kind of stabilizing a little bit relative to the decline we saw in spreads over the last year. And we still have old mortgage and old securities that will continue to roll off the books that will have to reinvest that new lower rates. So there are mitigants to the rate rise, which I think will put a cap on margins. But I do think year-over-year, margin will be higher and Q1 to Q4 margin will be higher."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with a review of our performance in 2015",560,"Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with a review of our performance in 2015 as a whole in addition to providing some forward-looking perspectives.
We delivered solid results this quarter, which is a direct result of the focus we've maintained on executing our primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing capital return to shareholders. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported $0.91 of earnings per share, which included $0.03 of discrete tax benefits. When adjusting for noncore items, earnings per share were stable compared with the prior quarter and prior year. Continued improvement in net interest income this quarter was offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of challenging market conditions in addition to normal quarterly variability. Capital markets-related income was in line with the prior quarter as the slowdown in fixed income markets was offset by higher equity origination fees and trading income, the latter which was a result of increased client-driven interest rate hedging activities.  Overall, we're successfully deepening client relationships within our Wholesale Banking platform and benefiting from our diverse business mix and breadth of capabilities. 
We achieved our goal of attaining a sub-63% efficiency ratio and ended the year with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 62.7%, 24 basis points better than 2014. Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving our long-term goal of being sub-60%, and we'll continue to diligently manage expenses while also investing in strategic revenue-generating initiatives throughout the company. 
We continue to see the benefits of our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts, which drove a 4 basis point improvement in our net interest margin and a $34 million increase in net interest income. This is further realization of a positive shift in our overall earning asset and funding mix.
Average loans were up 2% compared to the third quarter, driven by growth across most sectors, including commercial, consumer direct and residential mortgage. While loan growth will ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident in our ability to generate growth in segments where returns are appropriate and we can have deeper relationships. However, we're closely manage areas that don't meet those thresholds. 
Average deposits were also up 2%, which is further evidence of the success we're having in deepening client relationships across the company. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability, the latter of which is evidenced by the 35% reduction in long-term debt over the past year. 
Over asset -- overall asset quality remains favorable. However, we did see an increase in nonperforming loans as a result of deterioration in our energy-related exposure, which Aleem will provide details on later. 
Provision expense was less impacted as we've been building reserves in the previous quarters. The net charge-off ratio was 24 basis points, a strong result but likely unsustainable long term. 
Lastly, our capital position continues to be strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis.
So with that as a brief overview, I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the quarter's performance."

Before I jump into the details, I'd like to call your attention to a new table we're presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past 5 quarters and will help",3212,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Before I jump into the details, I'd like to call your attention to a new table we're presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past 5 quarters and will help you analyze our financial performance in an efficient manner. As it is year end, we've added this slide to the main presentation. And going forward, you'll find this in the appendix. 
Moving to Slide 5, you can see the net interest margin improved by 4 basis points, driven by higher securities yields as a result of slower prepayment speeds, further low-cost deposit growth and lower long-term debt as we received a full quarter benefit of the $1.7 billion debt reduction in the third quarter. Net interest income increased $34 million sequentially, driven by solid 2% loan and deposit growth and the 4 basis point improvement in NIM. As a result of our active balance sheet management efforts, overall net interest income has been grinding higher since the first quarter, which we had anticipated would be the trough. 
For the full year, net interest income declined 2% entirely due to a decline in commercial loan swap income as a result of lower fixed rates. In 2016, commercial loan swap income will decline modestly relative to 2015 largely due to an anticipated increase in LIBOR, which would be more than offset by higher net interest income from the core asset sensitivity of the balance sheet.
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter net interest margin to improve further 3 to 5 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. From there, NIM will likely be relatively stable for the remainder of 2016, assuming we only get one additional increase in the federal funds rate.
We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income declined $32 million sequentially, primarily driven by asset disposition gains in the third quarter and lower wealth management-related revenue in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in mortgage-related income.
Wealth management-related revenue declined to $13 million sequentially, partially due to seasonal trust fees typically earned in the third quarter but also due to market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. 
Investment banking income declined $11 million as fixed income originations were negatively impacted by challenging market conditions. 
Equity originations and M&A, however, remained relatively strong, which is a reflection of the strategic capability that we have expanded over the past few years.
Trading income increased $11 million, driven by higher derivative marketing revenue as commercial clients increased their utilization of interest rate swaps to hedge potential changes in rates. 
Mortgage servicing income improved by $16 million due to higher servicing fees, some of which is seasonal, lower decay expense and better hedge performance. 
Mortgage production income declined $5 million as lower production was generally offset by improved channel mix.
Service charges on deposits continued to steadily decline, a reflection of the increased transparency and technology we are providing our clients so they can manage their accounts more effectively. This decline will continue in 2016, in part driven by enhancements to our posting order process, which, once fully implemented, will help our clients save more money and reduce our service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter. This transition will occur in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, noninterest income was down 4%, driven by declines across most categories largely due to the challenging market conditions experienced in the second half of 2015. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $35 million sequentially, almost entirely due to $32 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the previous quarter related to the successful resolution of previous mortgage matters. 
Outside processing and software costs were up $22 million due to higher utilization of certain third-party services in addition to normal quarterly variability. 
Amortization expense increased by $8 million, similar to last year's increase, as we invested additional capital in low-income communities, which was generally offset by a correspondingly lower provision for income taxes. 
Offsetting these increases was a $35 million decline in personnel costs, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs as we calibrated expenses to actual performance. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2015, which is consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, driven by a combination of higher personnel expense and outside processing and software costs. 
For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 1% compared to 2014 and have declined each of the past 4 years. In fact, adjusted expenses are down 15% since 2011, evidence of our efforts to operate more efficiently. 
Separately, while not a noninterest expense point, I will highlight that the discrete tax benefits we recognized in 2015 resulted in an effective tax rate of 28% for the full year, which is below what we would consider a more normal range in the low 30s. 
As we look to the first quarter of this year, we anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses and also a return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefit costs. In addition, our marketing and customer development costs will weigh more heavily in the first half of the year versus the second half as we're introducing a new campaign to further advance our purpose as a company. 
Bigger picture, after 4 consecutive years of declines, we expect 2016 expenses to be higher than 2015 as we expect revenues to improve. We will maintain our focus on the efficiency ratio. And if revenues do not materialize, we will have to adjust our expense base accordingly. 
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.2% in the fourth quarter, up slightly over the prior quarter and year. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.7%, better than our 2015 target and 24 basis points better than 2014.
For 2016, we're targeting revenue growth that exceeds expense growth and thus a tangible efficiency ratio that improves. That being said, the pace of improvement will be significantly lower than previous years as our core expenses have already declined substantially and the operating environment, while improving in certain areas, remains challenging overall. Nonetheless, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of a delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 9. Overall asset quality remained solid during the quarter, evidenced by a 24 basis point net charge-off ratio and a 49 basis point NPL ratio. We did experience a deterioration in our energy portfolio, which, when combined with a proactive NPL sales in prior quarters, resulted in an NPL ratio that was 14 basis points higher sequentially but very much in line with last year. 
As it relates to energy, not much has changed with regard to our exposure and mix. The energy portfolio is 2.2% of the total loan portfolio, which is down 11% over the past year. The exploration and production and oilfield services portfolios, which are the most negatively impacted by prolonged low oil prices, represent a little under 40% of the total energy portfolio or slightly under 1% of total loans. 
Our reserves for the energy portfolio are approximately 4.5% and when isolated to the 2 most severely impacted sectors are near 12%. In addition, total reserves of $1.8 billion have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio. Losses in the E&P and oilfield services portfolios will be elevated over the next couple of years and will thus cause overall C&I loss rates to rise from their low levels today. However, given all of the factors I mentioned, we believe our energy-related risk remains very manageable in the context of the overall company. 
The provision for credit losses increased $19 million sequentially and the ALLL ratio declined 5 basis points to 1.29%, consistent with overall credit quality trends. 
Looking ahead, we expect nonperforming loans and net charge-offs to increase primarily as a result of further stress in the energy portfolio. Despite this, we would still expect the company's overall net charge-off rate to be less than 40 basis points in 2016. Provision expense this year will more closely match net charge-offs as the multiyear improvement in asset quality abates.
Ultimately, our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in all of our loan portfolios combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our commercial and consumer portfolios in addition to lower levels of payoffs. Commercial loan growth was broad based and driven by corporate, commercial auto dealer and commercial real estate clients, while consumer loan growth was driven by growth in direct, indirect and guaranteed student loans. The momentum in the consumer direct portfolio continues to be strong, driven by LightStream, our partnership with GreenSky and further success with our credit card offering. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2 billion or 2%, driven by 3% growth in C&I and 13% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, payoffs in commercial real estate and reductions in indirect consumer loans given our focus on returns. 
In total, we have proactively sold or securitized approximately $5 billion of loans since the middle of 2014. Going forward, we will periodically sell or securitize lower-return loans as part of our balance sheet optimization focus, though likely not at the pace of the past 18 months. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.9 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 8% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. 
Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments. 
In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within Wholesale Banking, continue to do an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill referenced earlier, our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher-cost long-term debt by $4.5 billion or 35% in just the past year. 
Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong while higher-cost deposits have been gradually declining. 
As interest rates rise, some of these trends will reverse. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was stable sequentially and up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings, partially offset by a lower AOCI as a result of higher interest rates. 
Per our 2015 capital plan, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the fourth quarter. In addition, we repurchased an incremental $39 million of common stock in December, which reflects our overall commitment to increase capital return to shareholders. We expect to repurchase approximately $350 million of additional common stock in the first half of 2016 to complete our 2015 capital plan. 
As a result of our capital return program, we're continuing to drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. 
Lastly, as of January 1, the liquidity coverage ratio is now a formal requirement. We have started the year in full compliance, and we'll, of course, maintain that status over the course of 2016. 
Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 13.  
Net income declined 6% sequentially as elevated market volatility resulted in lower Wealth Management-related revenue. We also had a modest increase in expenses, driven in part by investments in our card offerings as well as various onetime items. 
Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 4% annually, benefiting from continued low-cost deposit growth and our balance sheet optimization efforts. The strong growth in our consumer direct portfolios has afforded us the opportunity to sell, securitize or reduce production in lower-return areas. 
Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% for the full year with much of this growth coming from deeper relationships with our mass affluent client base, aided by our investments in Premier Bankers and the SummitView platform. 
On a full year basis, CPWM posted a strong net income growth of 8%, which is once again the result of strong deposit growth, our balance sheet optimization efforts and further improvements in credit quality. Loan balances declined 3% in 2015 as we sold or securitized approximately $2 billion of loans. But organic consumer loan production was solid and increased 5%. 
Noninterest income declined 1% for the full year largely due to the headwinds wealth management faced in 2015 but also due to the continued decline in service charges. While current market conditions have made growing wealth management revenue more challenging, meeting more of our clients' wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for our company. 
Expenses in CPWM have been well controlled as we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing talent and technology. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments and expect this to increase as mobile adoption rates and digital sales trend upwards. 
Bigger picture, the progress we have made in optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped to offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. We're optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business, both as it executes against its strategic priorities and as the value of our strong deposit franchise is more fully realized in a normal interest rate environment.
Moving to Wholesale Banking on Slide 14. We had a solid quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions. Revenues were down 3% sequentially but stable relative to the prior year. Much of the decline in revenue was driven by overall market volatility, which not only impacted debt origination activity but also resulted in adverse mark-to-market impacts. Partially mitigating these impacts was strength in other product areas, such as equity originations, equity sales and trading and derivatives marketing, a reflection of the increasing diversity of our business model. 
Net interest income was up 1% sequentially as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by margin compression. 
Overall, net income declined 9% sequentially as a result of the declines in noninterest income and increased provision expense. While we have been building reserves for our energy exposure since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prolonged low oil price environment will continue to place pressure on the provision expense in this business. 
On a full year basis, we saw strong performance with a record year for Wholesale Bank, demonstrated by the 9% increase in net income, driven by broad-based revenue growth, partially offset by energy-related reserve increases. 
Net interest income was up 6%, driven by 8% loan growth and 16% deposit growth. The loan growth was broad based across each line of business and most industry verticals, partially offset by intentional reductions in lower-return areas. The deposit momentum within this business also continues to be strong, evidence of the success our liquidity specialists within wholesale are having and the enhancements we've made to our treasury and payment product offerings. 
Noninterest income was up 10%, in part due to the 14% growth in investment banking income, where we had record years in equity originations, M&A, syndicated and leveraged finance and investment-grade bond originations. The breadth of growth here is reflective of the investments we've made to expand our capabilities and thus become more of a strategic adviser to all of our wholesale clients. 
The tangible efficiency ratio improved further to 48.6% as we drove further operating leverage while also investing in revenue-generating initiatives. 
In conclusion, while market conditions can be choppy quarter-to-quarter, we're encouraged by our differentiated business model within Wholesale Banking and are confident in the opportunities we have to expand our client base, meet more of their complex corporate finance and advisory needs and continue to grow our business.
Moving to the mortgage segment. Revenues were stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income. Net income declined $38 million as a result of the $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined by $22 million as a result of lower margins, both in production and our held-for-investment loan portfolio. These declines were partially offset by an increase in servicing income as a result of portfolio acquisitions over the past couple of years. 
For the full year, we saw a $137 million increase in adjusted net income, which is primarily due to the significantly improved credit quality of the loan portfolio, both as a result of the improving housing market and our proactive actions to derisk the book. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in net interest income as a result of $2.3 billion of loan sales in 2014 and lower loan spreads in 2015.
Production volume increased by 38% in 2015 due primarily to higher refinancing activity. New purchase volume also improved in 2015, a broader sign of the continued improvement of the economies in our markets. We also grew the servicing portfolio by 5% as a result of portfolio acquisitions. In both production and servicing, we achieved our objectives of smart, targeted market share growth. 
I would also like to point out that we successfully switched to a new loan origination system in the second half of 2015, which facilitates a faster and simpler loan process for our clients and teammates but also allowed us to more efficiently meet the new trigger requirements, which became effective October 1. This was a significant and important undertaking, and we have already been able to use our success as a competitive advantage to attract new talent in several of our markets. 
Overall, the mortgage business continues to benefit from improving asset quality and good expense discipline, both of which have allowed this business to become a more steady contributor to the bottom line performance of this company. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill to share some concluding perspectives on our performance in 2015 and our outlook for 2016."
305901,318243527,920329,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Aleem. So coming into last year, we had several key objectives: continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital return.Overall, I'm please",560,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. So coming into last year, we had several key objectives: continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital return.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in 2015 as we met each of these objectives. We grew earnings per share by a solid 11%, we met our efficiency ratio goal, we increased ROA by 5 basis points and advanced the revenue growth trajectory of many businesses, all in the context of managing the headwinds associated with a prolonged low interest rate environment. We also grew tangible book value per share by 6% and returned over 60% of our earnings back to our shareholders, continuing our path of improving capital returns. 
Our performance is a reflection of the diversity of our business model where each segment made strong contributions to enhance the financial performance of our company. Within consumer and private wealth, organic production growth and higher-return portfolios and continued momentum on the deposit front have allowed us to further optimize the balance sheet. Our investments in digital have allowed us to better identify and meet more client needs while also extracting efficiencies from certain areas. In wholesale, our differentiated business model allowed us to absorb the impact of the more challenging market conditions in the second half of the year and drive strong, high single-digit growth in revenue and net income. In particular, I'm pleased with the more integrated One Team approach we delivered to our clients, and that's evidenced by a 36% increase in capital markets revenue from the commercial real estate and private wealth businesses. This increase in client and product diversity will be an important contributor to the long-term growth of Wholesale Banking. 
And within mortgage, we benefited from the abatement of legacy mortgage-related cost but also from the targeted growth initiatives we have in place to grow production and servicing. The transition to a new origination platform was time consuming and challenging, but I believe we have the right risk and operational foundation to place -- to further advance our mortgage business. 
So as we look into 2016, we'll remain focused on the same primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency, all with the goal of creating further value for our clients and shareholders. While the revenue environment is expected to improve, we expect credit costs will normalize and the nonrecurring benefits we had in 2015 will abate. Consequently, we'll be -- we'll need to deliver positive operating leverage in 2016 in order to achieve our financial objectives and make further progress towards our long-term target of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
So to conclude, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our teammates for their key roles in delivering our 2015 financial results. Many of them are on the phone today. Our team is diligently focused on fulfilling our purpose of widening the way to financial well-being for our clients, communities and shareholders. As we look into 2016, we'll further advance this purpose, facilitating a dialogue about money in order to help Americans move from financial stress to control and, ultimately, to confidence. Our team is absolutely ready to go. 
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Ankur and we'll begin the Q&A portion."

So you know our energy exposure overall is only 2.2% of our total loan book, first of all. Secondly, within that, E&P and oilfield services are 40%. So only about 1% of our total loan portfolio is in those 2 sectors, which should probably be the sectors most negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Within that, now you think about we've got about 4.5% of reserves against the entire energy book. So for those 2 segments, our reserve levels are closer to 12%. So that starts to feel pretty good. And then thirdly, of course we've got a total of $1.8 billion of ALLL in total, which is available to cover all of our loans. So as I think about what might happen here in 2016, '17, '18, we will see some increase in NPLs, we will see some increase in provisioning against our energy portfolio. But in the context of the rest of the book, where our resi mortgage exposure continues to get better and better, and as charge-off levels and required reserves continue to come down, I think that our 2016 charge-off levels and provision levels for energy actually are looking very manageable."

If we were to have expenses coming in at $1.35 billion, you imply something like mid-single-digit growth, and, Aleem, given your comments around positive operating leverage, that implies revenue growth should be north of somewhere -- of 5%. I was just wondering, maybe can you talk us through the components of revenue growth? How should we think about NII growth? What does it mean for the net interest margin over the next couple of quarters? And on the fee side, how do we think about the split between wholesale and consumer fees? Clearly, consumer will likely be under pressure as you make some changes. Markets have come down, so maybe that'll hurt the wealth business.

So if you think about NII overall, for the last several years, it's been essentially flat, maybe even coming down a small amount. And that's been the effect of declining NIMs, essentially being offset by production and growth. Now that NIMs are no longer declining and we're looking for NIM to be essentially stable for 2016, that underlying sort of organic loan production and growth on both assets and liabilities is going to start to show through. And as that shows through, I think we'll see NII start to climb in '16, sort of as it started to do in '15 after the first quarter. So I think that'll be where you see the growth in revenue. On the fee income side, you're right, we're not really expecting growth in consumer service charges. That's not going to be a growth area for us. But the growth that we've seen overall in wholesale will continue -- I think, will continue to appear. The One Team approach that we've got, our ability to meet more of our clients' needs across more products and be a bigger, more of a strategic adviser to more clients, I think, continues to show up. So I think that'll be helpful. And I think mortgage will also become a more sort of consistent contributor to the bottom line. So that's where revenue will appear."

The offset to that -- so that's -- the rate hike is going to be helpful, and we're asset sensitive. And we're asset sensitive actually at every key rate duration point across the curve. So that will be helpful. The offset to that is competitive pressures are still strong. Spreads continue to be tight, if anything grinding maybe a little bit tighter but sort of kind of stabilizing a little bit relative to the decline we saw in spreads over the last year. So -- and we still have old mortgages and old securities that will continue to roll off the book that we'll have to reinvest at new lower rates.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with a review of our performance in 2015 as a whole in addition to providing some forward-looking perspectives.
We delivered solid results this quarter, which is a direct result of the focus we've maintained on executing our primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing capital return to shareholders. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported $0.91 of earnings per share, which included $0.03 of discrete tax benefits. When adjusting for noncore items, earnings per share were stable compared with the prior quarter and prior year. Continued improvement in net interest income this quarter was offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of challenging market conditions in addition to normal quarterly variability. Capital markets-related income was in line with the prior quarter as the slowdown in fixed income markets was offset by higher equity origination fees and trading income, the latter which was a result of increased client-driven interest rate hedging activities.  Overall, we're successfully deepening client relationships within our Wholesale Banking platform and benefiting from our diverse business mix and breadth of capabilities. 
We achieved our goal of attaining a sub-63% efficiency ratio and ended the year with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 62.7%, 24 basis points better than 2014. Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving our long-term goal of being sub-60%, and we'll continue to diligently manage expenses while also investing in strategic revenue-generating initiatives throughout the company. 
We continue to see the benefits of our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts, which drove a 4 basis point improvement in our net interest margin and a $34 million increase in net interest income. This is further realization of a positive shift in our overall earning asset and funding mix.
Average loans were up 2% compared to the third quarter, driven by growth across most sectors, including commercial, consumer direct and residential mortgage. While loan growth will ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident in our ability to generate growth in segments where returns are appropriate and we can have deeper relationships. However, we're closely manage areas that don't meet those thresholds. 
Average deposits were also up 2%, which is further evidence of the success we're having in deepening client relationships across the company. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability, the latter of which is evidenced by the 35% reduction in long-term debt over the past year. 
Over asset -- overall asset quality remains favorable. However, we did see an increase in nonperforming loans as a result of deterioration in our energy-related exposure, which Aleem will provide details on later. 
Provision expense was less impacted as we've been building reserves in the previous quarters. The net charge-off ratio was 24 basis points, a strong result but likely unsustainable long term. 
Lastly, our capital position continues to be strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis.
So with that as a brief overview, I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the quarter's performance."

Thank you for joining us this morning. Before I jump into the details, I'd like to call your attention to a new table we're presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past 5 quarters and will help",3208,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Before I jump into the details, I'd like to call your attention to a new table we're presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past 5 quarters and will help you analyze our financial performance in an efficient manner. As it is year end, we've added this slide to the main presentation. And going forward, you'll find this in the appendix. 
Moving to Slide 5, you can see the net interest margin improved by 4 basis points, driven by higher securities yields as a result of slower prepayment speeds, further low-cost deposit growth and lower long-term debt as we received a full quarter benefit of the $1.7 billion debt reduction in the third quarter. Net interest income increased $34 million sequentially, driven by solid 2% loan and deposit growth and the 4 basis point improvement in NIM. As a result of our active balance sheet management efforts, overall net interest income has been grinding higher since the first quarter, which we had anticipated would be the trough. 
For the full year, net interest income declined 2% entirely due to a decline in commercial loan swap income as a result of lower fixed rates. In 2016, commercial loan swap income will decline modestly relative to 2015 largely due to an anticipated increase in LIBOR, which would be more than offset by higher net interest income from the core asset sensitivity of the balance sheet.
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter net interest margin to improve further 3 to 5 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. From there, NIM will likely be relatively stable for the remainder of 2016, assuming we only get one additional increase in the federal funds rate.
We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income declined $32 million sequentially, primarily driven by asset disposition gains in the third quarter and lower wealth management-related revenue in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in mortgage-related income.
Wealth management-related revenue declined $13 million sequentially, partially due to seasonal trust fees typically earned in the third quarter but also due to market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. 
Investment banking income declined $11 million as fixed income originations were negatively impacted by challenging market conditions. 
Equity originations and M&A, however, remained relatively strong, which is a reflection of the strategic capability that we have expanded over the past few years.
Trading income increased $11 million, driven by higher derivative marketing revenue as commercial clients increased their utilization of interest rate swaps to hedge potential changes in rates. 
Mortgage servicing income improved by $16 million due to higher servicing fees, some of which is seasonal, lower decay expense and better hedge performance. 
Mortgage production income declined $5 million as lower production was generally offset by improved channel mix.
Service charges on deposits continued to steadily decline, a reflection of the increased transparency and technology we are providing our clients so they can manage their accounts more effectively. This decline will continue in 2016, in part driven by enhancements to our posting order process, which, once fully implemented, will help our clients save more money and reduce our service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter. This transition will occur in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, noninterest income was down 4%, driven by declines across most categories largely due to the challenging market conditions experienced in the second half of 2015. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $35 million sequentially, almost entirely due to $32 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the previous quarter related to the successful resolution of previous mortgage matters. 
Outside processing and software costs were up $22 million due to higher utilization of certain third-party services in addition to normal quarterly variability. 
Amortization expense increased by $8 million, similar to last year's increase, as we invested additional capital in low-income communities, which was generally offset by a correspondingly lower provision for income taxes. 
Offsetting these increases was a $35 million decline in personnel costs, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs as we calibrated expenses to actual performance. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2015, which is consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, driven by a combination of higher personnel expense and outside processing and software costs. 
For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 1% compared to 2014 and have declined each of the past 4 years. In fact, adjusted expenses are down 15% since 2011, evidence of our efforts to operate more efficiently. 
Separately, while not a noninterest expense point, I will highlight that the discrete tax benefits we recognized in 2015 resulted in an effective tax rate of 28% for the full year, which is below what we would consider a more normal range in the low 30s. 
As we look to the first quarter of this year, we anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses and also a return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefit costs. In addition, our marketing and customer development costs will weigh more heavily in the first half of the year versus the second half as we're introducing a new campaign to further advance our purpose as a company. 
Bigger picture, after 4 consecutive years of declines, we expect 2016 expenses to be higher than 2015 as we expect revenues to improve. We will maintain our focus on the efficiency ratio. And if revenues do not materialize, we will have to adjust our expense base accordingly. 
As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.2% in the fourth quarter, up slightly over the prior quarter and year. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.7%, better than our 2015 target and 24 basis points better than 2014.
For 2016, we're targeting revenue growth that exceeds expense growth and thus a tangible efficiency ratio that improves. That being said, the pace of improvement will be significantly lower than previous years as our core expenses have already declined substantially and the operating environment, while improving in certain areas, remains challenging overall. Nonetheless, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60%, and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 9. Overall asset quality remained solid during the quarter, evidenced by a 24 basis point net charge-off ratio and a 49 basis point NPL ratio. We did experience a deterioration in our energy portfolio, which, when combined with a proactive NPL sales in prior quarters, resulted in an NPL ratio that was 14 basis points higher sequentially but very much in line with last year. 
As it relates to energy, not much has changed with regard to our exposure and mix. The energy portfolio is 2.2% of the total loan portfolio, which is down 11% over the past year. The exploration and production and oilfield services portfolios, which are the most negatively impacted by prolonged low oil prices, represent a little under 40% of the total energy portfolio or slightly under 1% of total loans. 
Our reserves for the energy portfolio are approximately 4.5% and when isolated to the 2 most severely impacted sectors are near 12%. In addition, total reserves of $1.8 billion have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio. Losses in the E&P and oilfield services portfolios will be elevated over the next couple of years and will thus cause overall C&I loss rates to rise from their low levels today. However, given all of the factors I mentioned, we believe our energy-related risk remains very manageable in the context of the overall company. 
The provision for credit losses increased $19 million sequentially and the ALLL ratio declined 5 basis points to 1.29%, consistent with overall credit quality trends. 
Looking ahead, we expect nonperforming loans and net charge-offs to increase primarily as a result of further stress in the energy portfolio. Despite this, we would still expect the company's overall net charge-off rate to be less than 40 basis points in 2016. Provision expense this year will more closely match net charge-offs as the multiyear improvement in asset quality abates.
Ultimately, our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in all of our loan portfolios combined with a view on economic conditions. 
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by continued momentum in our commercial and consumer portfolios in addition to lower levels of payoffs. Commercial loan growth was broad based and driven by corporate, commercial auto dealer and commercial real estate clients, while consumer loan growth was driven by growth in direct, indirect and guaranteed student loans. The momentum in the consumer direct portfolio continues to be strong, driven by LightStream, our partnership with GreenSky and further success with our credit card offering. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2 billion or 2%, driven by 3% growth in C&I and 13% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, payoffs in commercial real estate and reductions in indirect consumer loans given our focus on returns. 
In total, we have proactively sold or securitized approximately $5 billion of loans since the middle of 2014. Going forward, we will periodically sell or securitize lower-return loans as part of our balance sheet optimization focus, though likely not at the pace of the past 18 months. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.9 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 8% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. 
Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client-facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments. 
In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within Wholesale Banking, continue to do an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill referenced earlier, our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher-cost long-term debt by $4.5 billion or 35% in just the past year. 
Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low-cost deposit growth continues to be strong while higher-cost deposits have been gradually declining. 
As interest rates rise, some of these trends will reverse. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.
Slide 12 provides an update on our capital positions, which continues to be strong. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was stable sequentially and up 6% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings, partially offset by a lower AOCI as a result of higher interest rates. 
Per our 2015 capital plan, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the fourth quarter. In addition, we repurchased an incremental $39 million of common stock in December, which reflects our overall commitment to increase capital return to shareholders. We expect to repurchase approximately $350 million of additional common stock in the first half of 2016 to complete our 2015 capital plan. 
As a result of our capital return program, we're continuing to drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. 
Lastly, as of January 1, the liquidity coverage ratio is now a formal requirement. We have started the year in full compliance, and we'll, of course, maintain that status over the course of 2016. 
Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 13.  
Net income declined 6% sequentially as elevated market volatility resulted in lower Wealth Management-related revenue. We also had a modest increase in expenses, driven in part by investments in our card offerings as well as various onetime items. 
Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 4% annually, benefiting from continued low-cost deposit growth and our balance sheet optimization efforts. The strong growth in our consumer direct portfolios has afforded us the opportunity to sell, securitize or reduce production in lower-return areas. 
Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% for the full year with much of this growth coming from deeper relationships with our mass affluent client base, aided by our investments in Premier Bankers and the SummitView platform. 
On a full year basis, CPWM posted strong net income growth of 8%, which is once again the result of strong deposit growth, our balance sheet optimization efforts and further improvements in credit quality. Loan balances declined 3% in 2015 as we sold or securitized approximately $2 billion of loans. But organic consumer loan production was solid and increased 5%. 
Noninterest income declined 1% for the full year largely due to the headwinds wealth management faced in 2015 but also due to the continued decline in service charges. While current market conditions have made growing wealth management revenue more challenging, meeting more of our clients' wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for our company. 
Expenses in CPWM have been well controlled as we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing talent and technology. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments and expect this to increase as mobile adoption rates and digital sales trend upwards. 
Bigger picture, the progress we have made in optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. We're optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business, both as it executes against its strategic priorities and as the value of our strong deposit franchise is more fully realized in a normal interest rate environment.
Moving to Wholesale Banking on Slide 14. We had a solid quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions. Revenues were down 3% sequentially but stable relative to the prior year. Much of the decline in revenue was driven by overall market volatility, which not only impacted debt origination activity but also resulted in adverse mark-to-market impacts. Partially mitigating these impacts was strength in other product areas, such as equity originations, equity sales and trading and derivatives marketing, a reflection of the increasing diversity of our business model. 
Net interest income was up 1% sequentially as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by margin compression. 
Overall, net income declined 9% sequentially as a result of the declines in noninterest income and increased provision expense. While we have been building reserves for our energy exposure since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prolonged low oil price environment will continue to place pressure on the provision expense in this business. 
On a full year basis, we saw strong performance with a record year for Wholesale Bank, demonstrated by the 9% increase in net income, driven by broad-based revenue growth, partially offset by energy-related reserve increases. 
Net interest income was up 6%, driven by 8% loan growth and 16% deposit growth. The loan growth was broad based across each line of business and most industry verticals, partially offset by intentional reductions in lower-return areas. The deposit momentum within this business also continues to be strong, evidence of the success our liquidity specialists within wholesale are having and the enhancements we've made to our treasury and payment product offerings. 
Noninterest income was up 10%, in part due to the 14% growth in investment banking income, where we had record years in equity originations, M&A, syndicated and leveraged finance and investment-grade bond originations. The breadth of growth here is reflective of the investments we've made to expand our capabilities and thus become more of a strategic adviser to all of our wholesale clients. 
The tangible efficiency ratio improved further to 48.6% as we drove further operating leverage while also investing in revenue-generating initiatives. 
In conclusion, while market conditions can be choppy quarter-to-quarter, we're encouraged by our differentiated business model within Wholesale Banking and are confident in the opportunities we have to expand our client base, meet more of their complex corporate finance and advisory needs and continue to grow our business.
Moving to the mortgage segment. Revenues were stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income. Net income declined $38 million as a result of the $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined by $22 million as a result of lower margins, both in production and our held-for-investment loan portfolio. These declines were partially offset by an increase in servicing income as a result of portfolio acquisitions over the past couple of years. 
For the full year, we saw a $137 million increase in adjusted net income, which is primarily due to the significantly improved credit quality of the loan portfolio, both as a result of the improving housing market and our proactive actions to derisk the book. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in net interest income as a result of $2.3 billion of loan sales in 2014 and lower loan spreads in 2015.
Production volume increased by 38% in 2015 due primarily to higher refinancing activity. New purchase volume also improved in 2015, a broader sign of the continued improvement of the economies in our markets. We also grew the servicing portfolio by 5% as a result of portfolio acquisitions. In both production and servicing, we achieved our objectives of smart, targeted market share growth. 
I would also like to point out that we successfully switched to a new loan origination system in the second half of 2015, which facilitates a faster and simpler loan process for our clients and teammates but also allowed us to more efficiently meet the new trigger requirements, which became effective October 1. This was a significant and important undertaking, and we have already been able to use our success as a competitive advantage to attract new talent in several of our markets. 
Overall, the mortgage business continues to benefit from improving asset quality and good expense discipline, both of which have allowed this business to become a more steady contributor to the bottom line performance of this company. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill to share some concluding perspectives on our performance in 2015 and our outlook for 2016."

So coming into last year, we had several key objectives: continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital return.Overall, I'm please",561,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. So coming into last year, we had several key objectives: continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital return.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in 2015 as we met each of these objectives. We grew earnings per share by a solid 11%, we met our efficiency ratio goal, we increased ROA by 5 basis points and advanced the revenue growth trajectory of many businesses, all in the context of managing the headwinds associated with a prolonged low interest rate environment. We also grew tangible book value per share by 6% and returned over 60% of our earnings back to our shareholders, continuing our path of improving capital returns. 
Our performance is a reflection of the diversity of our business model where each segment made strong contributions to enhance the financial performance of our company. Within consumer and private wealth, organic production growth and higher-return portfolios and continued momentum on the deposit front has allowed us to further optimize the balance sheet. Our investments in digital have allowed us to better identify and meet more client needs while also extracting efficiencies from certain areas. In wholesale, our differentiated business model allowed us to absorb the impact of the more challenging market conditions in the second half of the year and drive strong, high single-digit growth in revenue and net income. In particular, I'm pleased with the more integrated One Team approach we delivered to our clients, and that's evidenced by a 36% increase in capital markets revenue from the commercial, commercial real estate and private wealth businesses. This increase in client and product diversity will be an important contributor to the long-term growth of Wholesale Banking. 
And within mortgage, we benefited from the abatement of legacy mortgage-related cost but also from the targeted growth initiatives we have in place to grow production and servicing. The transition to a new origination platform was time consuming and challenging, but I believe we have the right risk and operational foundation to place -- to further advance our mortgage business. 
So as we look into 2016, we'll remain focused on the same primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency, all with the goal of creating further value for our clients and shareholders. While the revenue environment is expected to improve, we expect credit costs will normalize and the nonrecurring benefits we had in 2015 will abate. Consequently, we'll be -- we'll need to deliver positive operating leverage in 2016 in order to achieve our financial objectives and make further progress towards our long-term target of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
So to conclude, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our teammates for their key roles in delivering our 2015 financial results. Many of them are on the phone today. Our team is diligently focused on fulfilling our purpose of widening the way to financial well-being for our clients, communities and shareholders. As we look into 2016, we'll further advance this purpose, facilitating a dialogue about money in order to help Americans move from financial stress to control and, ultimately, to confidence. Our team is absolutely ready to go. 
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Ankur and we'll begin the Q&A portion."

So you know our energy exposure overall is only 2.2% of our total loan book, first of all. Secondly, within that, E&P and oilfield services are 40%. So only about 1% of our total loan portfolio is in those 2 sectors, which should probably be the sectors most negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Within that, now you think about we've got about 4.5% of reserves against the entire energy book. So for those 2 segments, our reserve levels are closer to 12%. So that starts to feel pretty good. And then thirdly, of course we've got a total of $1.8 billion of ALLL in total, which is available to cover all of our loans. So as I think about what might happen here in 2016, '17, '18, we will see some increase in NPLs, we will see some increase in provisioning against our energy portfolio. But in the context of the rest of the book, where our resi mortgage exposure continues to get better and better, and as charge-off levels and required reserves continue to come down, I think that our 2016 charge-off levels and provision levels for energy actually are looking very manageable."

So if you think about NII overall, for the last several years, it's been essentially flat, maybe even coming down a small amount. And that's been the effect of declining NIMs, essentially being offset by production and growth. Now that NIMs are no longer declining and we're looking for NIM to be essentially stable for 2016, that underlying sort of organic loan production and growth on both assets and liabilities is going to start to show through. And as that shows through, I think we'll see NII start to climb in '16, sort of as it started to do in '15 after the first quarter. So I think that'll be where you see the growth in revenue. On the fee income side, you're right, we're not really expecting growth in consumer service charges. That's not going to be a growth area for us. But the growth that we've seen overall in wholesale will continue -- I think, will continue to appear. The One Team approach that we've got, our ability to meet more of our clients' needs across more products and be a bigger, more of a strategic adviser to more clients, I think, continues to show up.

So to be clear on my margin expectations, Marty, I think the first quarter margin will go up from the fourth quarter. And I think that's sort of 3 to 5 basis points or so. And then from there for the rest of the year, I'm expecting it to be generally stable to the first quarter number, to the increased higher-margin level, assuming we get that one rate hike in the middle of the year. The offset to that -- so that's -- the rate hike is going to be helpful, and we're asset sensitive. And we're asset sensitive actually at every key rate duration point across the curve. So that will be helpful. The offset to that is competitive pressures are still strong. Spreads continue to be tight, if anything grinding maybe a little bit tighter but sort of kind of stabilizing a little bit relative to the decline we saw in spreads over the last year. So -- and we still have old mortgages and old securities that will continue to roll off the book that we'll have to reinvest at new lower rates. So there are mitigants to the rate rise, which I think will put a cap on margins. But I do think year-over-year, margin will be higher and Q1 to Q4 margin will be higher."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis. 
This quarter we saw the benefits of our consistent strategic focus and improving execution, the combination of which resulted in revenue growth that exceeded expense growth. As we communicated during the last earnings call, delivering positive operating leverage in 2016 was going to be necessary to overcome our expectation of higher credit costs and to achieve our financial objectives. 
Our performance in the first quarter was a good start towards meeting those objectives for the year. Specifically, we reported $0.84 per share slightly lower than the fourth quarter given typical seasoned  will patterns in our business and more importantly, up a solid 8% compared to year ago. Total revenue was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. This sequential improvement was driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income where we benefited from good performance across both mortgage and capital markets, the latter of which was notable given market conditions in January and February. 
Our net interest margin improved 6 basis points sequentially and is up 21 basis points over the past year, reflecting our continued efforts to optimize our balance sheet, including improving our loan mix, growing deposits and reducing long-term debt, all while carefully managing duration.
Despite a modest increase in our expense base, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.3%, a full 220 basis points better than last year and represents the focus we have maintained on disciplined expense management which has also created additional capacity to invest in our franchise. 
Average loans were up 2% sequentially driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. While loan growth were not likely sustained at this rate, I would characterize the overall economy and client activity levels as healthy, and we will remain focused on generating growth where returns are appropriate and we can create deeper client relationships. 
Average of deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year with the broad-based growth across our consumer private wealth and wholesale businesses. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. 
Asset quality, excluding energy, remains strong as evidenced by a 25 basis point net charge-off ratio, however, the low oil price environment continues to pressure our energy clients, which contributed to the increase in nonperforming loans, our reserves and provision expense. We remain focused on being proactive around energy and therefore have increased the resources and intensity around mitigating our risk and helping our clients navigate to this downturn. However, we continue to review this risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company. 
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increase 5% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Our strong capital position, combined with accumulative actions we've taken to improve our risks and earnings profile should help us further increase capital return to shareholders. 
Our 2016 capital plan is now under review and we'll have more to report on that outcome in late June. 
So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,327146434,961674,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Moving to Slide 4, you can see that the net interest margin improved 6 basis points, primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term ra",2642,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. 
Moving to Slide 4, you can see that the net interest margin improved 6 basis points, primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term rates and partially offset by slightly higher funding costs. 
Net interest income increased 3% sequentially, driven by the 6 basis point improvement in NIM and solid 2% loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin increased 21 basis points due to the same factors as the sequential drivers, but also due to our continuous balance sheet management and optimization efforts. These efforts have resulted in a favorable shift in our loan portfolio mix, a significant reduction in higher cost long-term debt driven by low-cost deposit growth and lower premium amortization expense in our securities portfolio.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, and assuming there are no additional increases in the Fed funds rate, we expect net interest margins to decline by an average of a couple of basis points per quarter.
If there are increases in the Fed funds rates, we would expect our net interest margin to benefit, given our modestly asset-sensitive positions with the amount of benefit dependent on the shape of the yield curve in addition to the broader competitive environment. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment, while also ensuring our balance sheet as structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates.
Moving to Slide 5, noninterest income increased $16 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage-related income resulting from a recent increase in refinancing activity. 
Capital markets-related income was up modestly, a performance that was better than anticipated due to a strong March, but also as a result of our continued long-term investments and market share gains in CIB. 
Wealth Management-related revenue declined $6 million sequentially due to challenging market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. 
Service charges on deposits were relatively flat from both the prior quarter and prior year. As a reminder, those will decline when we enhance our posting order process which will reduce service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter beginning in Q4. And as Bill referenced earlier, the culmination of the trends you saw on slide 4 and slide 5 resulted in total revenue that was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. 
Let's move on to expenses. Noninterest expense increased $30 million relative to the prior quarter, driven entirely by an $84 million increase in personnel expense as a result of the typical seasonal increases in FICA, incentive and 401K costs. Partially offsetting these increase were lower outside processing and software costs and legal and consulting expenses, partially due to normal quarterly variability. 
In comparison to the first quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 3%, largely due to higher marketing expenses in addition to continued and targeted investments in our businesses. Separately, while our FDIC premium expense has been declining modestly over the past 2 years as our risk profile has improved, beginning in the third quarter, this expense category will increase by approximately $10 million per quarter given the FDIC's recently announced surcharge on large depository institutions. This incremental surcharge is anticipated to be effective for approximately 10 quarters. 
As you can see on Slide 7, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.3% in the first quarter, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year as revenue growth exceeded expense growth, which was our goal coming into the year. Our first quarter progress, while early, puts us on pace to meet our objective of improving our efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year and more importantly, demonstrates our intense focus on strong expense discipline and our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio.
Turning to Slide 8. Overall asset quality remains strong during the quarter, as evidenced by net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, excluding the impact of energy that are down 28% and 9%, respectively, year-over-year. However, as anticipated, the NPL ratio increased due to deterioration in the energy portfolio, which when combined with loan growth resulted in an $18 million increase in the total allowance for loan and lease losses. 
With respect to the energy portfolio, we have provided some additional detail on this slide and more information on Slide 18 in the appendix. The energy portfolio remains stable at 2% of loans, with the composition also very similar to the prior quarter. Of note, E&P and oil field services, the 2 sectors most impacted by lower oil prices, represent only 38% of total energy loans, a mix we believe is favorable relative to the industry. 
In addition, we migrated an additional $250 million of energy loans to nonperforming status and also increased our criticize accruing balances by $150 million, the net of which brings our criticized ratio to 29%, up from 19% in the prior quarter. Approximately 90% of this quarter's migration was concentrated in the E&P sector where collateral coverage remains healthy, despite reserve base devaluations. And importantly, the vast majority of these loans were still current as of March 31. This migration and our allowance includes the effects of our internal risk review in addition to the results of the recent shared national credits exam.
Our energy-related provision expense in the quarter was approximately $30 million, half of which covered charge-offs and half of which was a reserve built, resulting in a 4.6% reserve ratio for total energy loans outstanding. 
Our total energy reserves as a percentage of E&P and oil field services are roughly 12%, which we believe is a more relevant measure that is responsive to portfolio mix.
As a reminder, our total reserves of $1.8 billion, which have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio, represent approximately 2x our nonperformers and 3.5x the midpoint of our 30 to 40 basis point net charge-off range for 2016. Big picture, while we have increased the resources and intensity around managing our exposure, we continue to view our energy-related risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.
From here, assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we would expect energy-related NPL formation to moderate as we have already taken significant action over the past few quarters. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016.
We also expect our ALLL to loans ratio to be relatively stable, which when combined with our expectation for loan growth should result in a total provision expense in 2016 that exceeds net charge-offs.
With regard to both charge-offs and provision expense, these are full year expectations and there maybe some quarterly variability given the uncertainty of when certain credits will be resolved and the results of our rigorous allowance process. 
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial real estate clients, while consumer loan growth was generally broad based. Our consumer direct strategy continues to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $4.9 billion or 4%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 20% growth in consumer direct, and was partially offset by declines in home equity, payoffs in commercial real estate and a smaller indirect portfolio following our $1 billion indirect auto securitizations last June. 
Turning to deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year with growth across most products and businesses. Our successful deposit growth strategy is the result of our commitment to meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and ultimately our teammates across all 3 business segments. 
Rates paid on deposits increased 2 basis points sequentially given the increase in short-term rates. If interest rates rise further, this trend will continue, however, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. We've added approximately $700 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and held our estimated the Basel III CET1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis at 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was up 5% sequentially and up 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. In addition, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds regulatory requirements. 
This quarter, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and common stock warrants and paid a $0.24 dividend. We will repurchase an additional $175 million of common stock during the second quarter to complete our 2015 capital plan.
As Bill referenced, we submitted our 2016 capital plans just a couple of weeks ago and we will disclose more on this matter once we are advised of the results.
As a result of our capital return program, we are driving down share counts. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The positive impact of our capital return program can be seen in year-over-year results, where 5% net income growth translated into 8% earnings per share growth as our long-term shareholders received a slightly larger ownership stake every quarter. Over several years, the compounding effect of a lower share count, combined with our steadily increasing dividend, is an important component of our owners' long-term returns.
Moving to the segment overviews, let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income decreased $15 [ph] million sequentially as continued market volatility resulted in lower Wealth Management-related income, but was $30 million higher compared to the prior year as a result of higher net interest income and improved asset quality. Net interest income was stable sequentially and up 5% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, coupled with our continued focus on balance sheet optimization. More specifically, our Direct Consumer Lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum with average balances up to $2 billion or 20% year-over-year as a result of the investments we've made in enhancing both our product offerings and client experience.
In addition, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 2% sequentially and 3% versus the prior year. 
Noninterest income was down 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year as our Wealth Management-related revenue streams have been pressured by market volatility and lower assets under management. Growing our Wealth Management business continues to be a key strategic priority for SunTrust, and we remain focused on retaining and recruiting top talent in efforts to both grow AUM and expand our client base. 
Asset quality remains strong with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. Going forward, we expect the improvements in the home equity portfolio to abate, thus resulting in an increased provision expense associated with loan growth.
Noninterest expense increased 2% year-over-year due to continued investments in technology, higher marketing expenditures and growth in revenue-generating positions. The efficiency ratio was stable as revenue growth and cost-saving initiatives funded these investments. Over time, we continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness within this business as we realize the benefits of our technology investments and work to deepen client relationships and increase teammate productivity.
Moving on to Wholesale Banking, we had another solid quarter. Revenues were up 4% sequentially and [indiscernible] end year-over-year as a result of higher net interest income driven by strong balance sheet growth and higher noninterest income. 
Capital markets related income was up $7 million sequentially and up modestly versus the prior year, despite the decline in industry transaction volume. Our strong performance relative to the market is the direct result of our successful execution of 2 multiyear strategies: Deepening client relationships; and meeting the capital markets needs of all SunTrust clients. 
Across both these fronts we saw evidence of success in the first quarter. First, our average fee per transaction in the first quarter was up 16% compared to 2015, reflective of our increasingly prominent role on client transactions. Second, capital markets-related income generated by commercial, CRE and PWM clients was up $10 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. We expect these trends to continue as we bring our full capabilities and One Team approach to all SunTrust clients. 
Net interest income continues its positive trajectory, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. This is primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth, the latter of which is driven by the increased value that our liquidity specialists are providing our clients and the investments we've made to enhance our Treasury and payment product offerings.
Overall, revenue growth continues to outpace expense growth, resulting in 100 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio versus the prior year. This positive operating leverage has funded strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, including the build out of our industry and corporate finance expertise within commercial banking, enhancements to our Treasury platform, upgrades to our client-facing infrastructure and further talent acquisitions.
Despite the strong revenue growth, net income declined both sequentially and year-over-year as the result of increased provision expense driven by loan growth, increased energy-related reserves and moderating asset quality improvements.
Looking ahead, while market conditions can be choppy and credit costs will normalize, our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated. Our broad product capabilities and industry expertise combined with our One Team approach will continue to bring increasing value to our clients and shareholders.
Moving to the mortgage segment, which has become a more steady contributor to the company's bottom line. Noninterest income increased to [ph] 9% sequentially, driven by both production and servicing. The $7 million increase in production income is largely due to higher refinancing activity in reaction to the decline in rates we saw this quarter, which also enabled higher gain-on-sale margins. 
Servicing income increased by $6 million due to improved net hedge performance and a lower decay expense. With -- relatedly, we purchased $8 billion [ph] of MSRs in the first quarter, $2 billion of which was on our system as of March 31 and $6 billion of which will transfer during the second quarter. This is consistent with our strategy to grow our servicing portfolio as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business. 
Application activity was up 37% sequentially and was strong across both the refinance and purchase clients. Given this, combined with the onset of the Spring selling season, we would expect second quarter mortgage production income to increase from first quarter levels. Some of this will be partially offset by a decline in servicing income as decay expense, which is recorded at loan closing, will increase as the refinance application activity in the first quarter is closed in the second quarter. 
Net interest income declined both sequentially and versus the prior year, driven by the decline in mortgage loan spreads given the low interest rate environment.
Expenses remain well controlled as continued focus on expense discipline and reduced credit-related expenses have funded investments to further improve efficiency and the client experience. 
Net income declined $23 million sequentially entirely due to a lower reserve release, as the improvement in mortgage credit quality, while still ongoing, moderates.
Big picture, while the benefit from reserve releases within this business will decline, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence, delivering an improved client experience and gaining smart market share should continue to contribute to the earnings growth of the company. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

And to conclude I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we've had in place for several years now. 
First, the diversity of our business model helped us to deliver 5% revenue growth despite a challenging market conditions. Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our strategic focus on improving efficiency and optimizing the balance sheet to enhance returns. These 2 strategies, which we have been working on since 2011 are key contributors to the 220 basis point reduction and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio and the 21 basis point improvement in NIM. 
This focus on expense management has also provided us capacity to make consistent investment to the company. As an example, we continue to see the benefits of the investments we've been making in CIB over the last 10 years, and are also encouraged by the results we're seeing from our commercial and CRE businesses. 
Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating good momentum. Also, our digital investments continue to pay off and Consumer Banking with steady increases in mobile usage and self-service deposits. And in mortgage, we continue to make targeted investments for growth across both origination and servicing.
Lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce share count. Our goal is to continue this trend. 
So big picture, our revenue trajectory is improving. Expenses remain well controlled. Credit quality outside of energy remains favorable and our capital position is strong. So I'm pleased with the continued progress and I remain highly optimistic about our company's future. 
And with that, let me turn back to Ankur to begin the Q&A portion."

Well, first of all, on swaps and amortization, yes. I characterize those as small helpers. If I think about 2016 relative to 2015, we're expecting -- because we were able to restructure part of our portfolio in 2015, we are expecting slightly lower levels of premium amortization in '16 relative to '15, but we're talking about sort of single-digit millions per quarter, these aren't big numbers. Likewise, if I think about the swap books '16 relative to '15, most of the changes in our swap will have actually already taken place. So one of the reasons we took that slide out from here, Ken, is that we don't expect to see much change in swaps year-over-year from here. Most of the changes have already occurred. And so, we really ought to be thinking about NIM and NII in total right here than sort of zooming in on one part of our interest rate risk management. that's the reason we took it out. And I don't think that those are sort of large numbers in the context of our overall rate risk and rate management perspective. To your point on NIM from here, the main -- we've got sort of several drivers why we're expecting a small run down in NIM from here. New production yields, still probably slightly lower than current portfolio yields. So as the portfolio turns over, that'll be a slight negative. Remember that the LCR requirement for banks our size goes up at the end of this year. And so as we build out our securities portfolio to meet the higher requirement at the end of this year, that'll be a slight drag on NIM, although it will be actually be a little bit of a help to NII. And so those are a couple of reasons why you'll see probably slightly lower NIM and NIM will grind down a little bit over the course of the year. But in context if you think about the last several years, NIM was coming down at a pretty rapid pace. And we got good loan growth. We got good deposit growth. We were able to hold NII about flat over the last several years, even in the face of all of that declining NIM. So now that the pace of NIM decline is moderating as a result of that first Fed hike, I'm expecting that we'll see some NII improvements over the course of the year."

Irrespective of rates and to the extent that we do get some rate hikes, that growth will accelerate. The industry's ability to grow noninterest income, I think, has been pressured in the past. But I think you're seeing us and other players also look for other businesses and other ways to meet more client needs to grow that. And of course, efficiency. Just improving productivity, improving our overall efficiency, that's all of those things are helping grow ROA, to the extent that we are then able to take that growth in ROA and translate that to accelerated growth in ROE, managing capital as best as we can. Obviously, that is not all in our hands. But you've seen payout ratios grow pretty substantially over the last several years. In our case, last year, yes, we were in the sort of mid-60% payout ratio, still lower than we would like.

What I look at is what you've asked about as I look out pipeline and production. And pipelines and production have been very consistent over the last several quarters. As I said earlier, production was a little higher this quarter and then we did have a some of the offsets and paydowns. So I think you're going to have some give-and-take. So if we go down the portfolio, to your point, I think CRE will be lower production. But that won't necessarily reflect itself in outstandings because we've had good production in the past. A lot of that is construction-related. People are completing their prices. There is less liquidity in the system, so that's liable to stay outstanding from a bit longer than it had it in the past. So there'll be some interesting offsets to CRE specifically. As we go to C&I, pipelines continue to be good. Our strategies are effective. We'll be very focused on return. So we'll be aggressive where we think we can get a lot of return and we won't be as aggressive where we don't think we can get the appropriate return. Consumer, I think that will continue to grow. You've seen the initiatives that we've had in place and investments that we've made in consumer. So as a production business, that will continue to grow sort of on a double-digit side. But again a little bit offset by the run off in home equity. So there are give and takes in all of this, which is again why I'm careful not to say loan growth as a number -- is the thing we want to give guidance around.

I don't think that there's much of a change to that. With stable revenues I would be thinking -- I would continue to think about expenses averaging.

If I think about going forward from here though to the rest of the year, our overall energy reserves, I think can play out a couple of different ways. Assuming there is no oil price shock, right? Assuming that energy prices are relatively stable to where they are now, I think a couple of things are going to happen. One, our energy reserves can be relatively stable. As we have charge-offs, we continue to provide for those and maintain our reserve coverage about where it is. Or two, energy reserves could decline as we work through certain credits, and as the formation of problem credit from here slows. So I think excluding a big decline in energy prices, I can see either of those scenarios from here."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis.
This quarter, we saw the benefits of our consistent strategic focus and improving execution, the combination of which resulted in revenue growth that exceeded expense growth. As we communicated during the last earnings call, delivering positive operating leverage in 2016 was going to be necessary to overcome our expectation of higher credit costs and to achieve our financial objectives.
Our performance in the first quarter was a good start towards meeting those objectives for the year. Specifically, we reported $0.84 per share, slightly lower than the fourth quarter given typical seasoned, well, patterns in our business and, more importantly, up a solid 8% compared to a year ago. Total revenue was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. This sequential improvement was driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income, where we benefited from good performance across both mortgage and capital markets, the latter of which was notable given market conditions in January and February.
Our net interest margin improved 6 basis points sequentially and is up 21 basis points over the past year, reflecting our continued efforts to optimize the balance sheet, including improving our loan mix, growing deposits and reducing long-term debt, all while carefully managing duration.
Despite a modest increase in our expense base, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.3%, a full 220 basis points better than last year and represents the focus we have maintained on disciplined expense management, which has also created additional capacity to invest in our franchise.
Average loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. While loan growth were not likely sustained at this rate, I would characterize the overall economy and client activity levels as healthy, and we will remain focused on generating growth where returns are appropriate and we can create deeper client relationships.
Average deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our consumer private wealth and wholesale businesses. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability.
Asset quality, excluding energy, remains strong as evidenced by a 25 basis point net charge-off ratio. However, the low oil price environment continues to pressure our energy clients, which contributed to the increase in nonperforming loans, our reserves and provision expense. We remain focused on being proactive around energy and, therefore, have increased the resources and intensity around mitigating our risk and helping our clients navigate through this downturn. However, we continue our view of this risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 5% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Our strong capital position, combined with accumulative actions we've taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, should help us further increase capital return to shareholders.
Our 2016 capital plan is now under review, and we'll have more to report on that outcome in late June.
So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,327146434,961833,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning.Moving to Slide 4, you can see that the net interest margin improved 6 basis points, primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term rat",2628,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning.
Moving to Slide 4, you can see that the net interest margin improved 6 basis points, primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term rates and partially offset by slightly higher funding costs.
Net interest income increased 3% sequentially, driven by the 6 basis point improvement in NIM and solid 2% loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin increased 21 basis points due to the same factors as the sequential drivers but also due to our continuous balance sheet management and optimization efforts. These efforts have resulted in a favorable shift in our loan portfolio mix, a significant reduction in higher-cost long-term debt, driven by low-cost deposit growth and lower premium amortization expense in our securities portfolio.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016 and assuming there are no additional increases in the Fed funds rate, we expect net interest margin to decline by an average of a couple of basis points per quarter. If there are increases in the Fed funds rates, we would expect our net interest margin to benefit given our modestly asset-sensitive positions, with the amount of benefit dependent on the shape of the yield curve in addition to the broader competitive environment. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates.
Moving to Slide 5. Noninterest income increased $16 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage-related income resulting from a recent increase in refinancing activity.
Capital markets-related income was up modestly, a performance that was better than anticipated due to a strong March but also as a result of our continued long-term investments and market share gains in CIB.
Wealth management-related revenue declined $6 million sequentially due to challenging market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity.
Service charges on deposits were relatively flat from both the prior quarter and prior year. As a reminder, those will decline when we enhance our posting order process, which will reduce service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter beginning in Q4. And as Bill referenced earlier, the combination of the trends you saw on Slide 4 and Slide 5 resulted in total revenue that was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
Let's move on to expenses. Noninterest expense increased $30 million relative to the prior quarter, driven entirely by an $84 million increase in personnel expense as a result of the typical seasonal increases in FICA, incentive and 401(k) costs. Partially offsetting this increase were lower outside processing and software costs and legal and consulting expenses, partially due to normal quarterly variability.
In comparison to the first quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 3%, largely due to higher marketing expenses in addition to continued and targeted investments in our businesses. Separately, while our FDIC premium expense has been declining modestly over the past 2 years as our risk profile has improved, beginning in the third quarter, this expense category will increase by approximately $10 million per quarter given the FDIC's recently announced surcharge on large depository institutions. This incremental surcharge is anticipated to be effective for approximately 10 quarters.
As you can see on Slide 7, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.3% in the first quarter, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year as revenue growth exceeded expense growth, which was our goal coming into the year. Our first quarter progress, while early, puts us on pace to meet our objective of improving our efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year and, more importantly, demonstrates our intense focus on strong expense discipline and our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio.
Turning to Slide 8. Overall asset quality remained strong during the quarter as evidenced by net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, excluding the impact of energy, that are down 28% and 9%, respectively, year-over-year. However, as anticipated, the NPL ratio increased due to deterioration in the energy portfolio, which, when combined with loan growth, resulted in an $18 million increase in the total allowance for loan and lease losses.
With respect to the energy portfolio, we have provided some additional detail on this slide and more information on Slide 18 in the appendix. The energy portfolio remains stable at 2% of loans, with the composition also very similar to the prior quarter. Of note, E&P and oilfield services, the 2 sectors most impacted by lower oil prices, represent only 38% of total energy loans, a mix we believe is favorable relative to the industry.
In addition, we migrated an additional $250 million of energy loans to nonperforming status and also increased our criticized accruing balances by $150 million, the net of which brings our criticized ratio to 29%, up from 19% in the prior quarter. Approximately 90% of this quarter's migration was concentrated in the E&P sector where collateral coverage remains healthy despite reserve base devaluations. And importantly, the vast majority of these loans were still current as of March 31. This migration and our allowance includes the effect of our internal risk review in addition to the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam.
Our energy-related provision expense in the quarter was approximately $30 million, half of which covered charge-offs and half of which was a reserve build, resulting in a 4.6% reserve ratio for total energy loans outstanding.
Our total energy reserves as a percentage of E&P and oilfield services are roughly 12%, which we believe is a more relevant measure that is responsive to portfolio mix.
As a reminder, our total reserves of $1.8 billion, which have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio, represent approximately 2x our nonperformers and 3.5x the midpoint of our 30 to 40 basis point net charge-off range for 2016. Big picture, while we have increased the resources and intensity around managing our exposure, we continue to view our energy-related risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.
From here, assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we would expect energy-related NPL formation to moderate as we have already taken significant action over the past few quarters. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016.
We also expect our ALLL-to-loans ratio to be relatively stable, which, when combined with our expectation for loan growth, should result in a total provision expense in 2016 that exceeds net charge-offs.
With regard to both charge-offs and provision expense, these are full year expectations and there may be some quarterly variability given the uncertainty of when certain credits will be resolved and the results of our rigorous allowance process.
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial real estate clients, while consumer loan growth was generally broad based. Our consumer direct strategy continues to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $4.9 billion or 4%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 20% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, payoffs in commercial real estate and a smaller indirect portfolio following our $1 billion indirect auto securitizations last June.
Turning to deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year with growth across most products and businesses. Our successful deposit growth strategy is the result of our commitment to meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and, ultimately, our teammates across all 3 business segments.
Rates paid on deposits increased 2 basis points sequentially given the increase in short-term rates. If interest rates rise further, this trend will continue. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. We've added approximately $700 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and held our estimated Basel III CET1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis at 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was up 5% sequentially and up 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. In addition, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds regulatory requirements.
This quarter, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and common stock warrants and paid a $0.24 dividend. We will repurchase an additional $175 million of common stock during the second quarter to complete our 2015 capital plan.
As Bill referenced, we submitted our 2016 capital plans just a couple of weeks ago, and we will disclose more on this matter once we are advised of the results.
As a result of our capital return program, we are driving down share counts. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The positive impact of our capital return program can be seen in year-over-year results, where 5% net income growth translated into 8% earnings per share growth as our long-term shareholders receive a slightly larger ownership stake every quarter. Over several years, the compounding effect of a lower share count, combined with our steadily increasing dividend, is an important component of our owners' long-term returns.
Moving to the segment overviews. Let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income decreased $15 million sequentially as continued market volatility resulted in lower wealth management-related income but was $30 million higher compared to the prior year as a result of higher net interest income and improved asset quality. Net interest income was stable sequentially and up 5% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, coupled with our continued focus on balance sheet optimization. More specifically, our direct consumer lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum, with average balances up to $2 billion or 20% year-over-year as a result of the investments we've made in enhancing both our product offerings and client experience. In addition, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 2% sequentially and 3% versus the prior year.
Noninterest income was down 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year as our wealth management-related revenue streams have been pressured by market volatility and lower assets under management. Growing our wealth management business continues to be a key strategic priority for SunTrust, and we remain focused on retaining and recruiting top talent in efforts to both grow AUM and expand our client base.
Asset quality remains strong, with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. Going forward, we expect the improvements in the home equity portfolio to abate, thus resulting in an increased provision expense associated with loan growth.
Noninterest expense increased 2% year-over-year due to continued investments in technology, higher marketing expenditures and growth in revenue-generating positions. The efficiency ratio was stable as revenue growth and cost-saving initiatives funded these investments. Over time, we continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness within this business as we realize the benefits of our technology investments and work to deepen client relationships and increase teammate productivity.
Moving on to Wholesale Banking, we had another solid quarter. Revenues were up 4% sequentially and year-over-year as a result of higher net interest income, driven by strong balance sheet growth and higher noninterest income.
Capital markets-related income was up $7 million sequentially and up modestly versus the prior year despite the decline in industry transaction volume. Our strong performance relative to the market is the direct result of our successful execution of 2 multiyear strategies: deepening client relationships and meeting the capital markets needs of all SunTrust clients.
Across both these fronts, we saw evidence of success in the first quarter. First, our average fee per transaction in the first quarter was up 16% compared to 2015, reflective of our increasingly prominent role on client transactions. Second, capital markets-related income generated by commercial, CRE and PWM clients was up $10 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. We expect these trends to continue as we bring our full capabilities and One Team approach to all SunTrust clients.
Net interest income continues its positive trajectory, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. This is primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth, the latter of which is driven by the increased value that our liquidity specialists are providing our clients and the investments we've made to enhance our treasury and payment product offerings.
Overall, revenue growth continues to outpace expense growth, resulting in 100 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio versus the prior year. This positive operating leverage has funded strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, including the build-out of our industry and corporate finance expertise within commercial banking, enhancements to our treasury platform, upgrades to our client-facing infrastructure and further talent acquisitions.
Despite the strong revenue growth, net income declined both sequentially and year-over-year as the result of increased provision expense, driven by loan growth, increased energy-related reserves and moderating asset quality improvements.
Looking ahead, while market conditions can be choppy and credit costs will normalize, our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated. Our broad product capabilities and industry expertise, combined with our One Team approach, will continue to bring increasing value to our clients and shareholders.
Moving to the mortgage segment, which has become a more steady contributor to the company's bottom line. Noninterest income increased 9% sequentially, driven by both production and servicing. The $7 million increase in production income is largely due to higher refinancing activity in reaction to the decline in rates we saw this quarter, which also enabled higher gain-on-sale margins.
Servicing income increased by $6 million due to improved net hedge performance and a lower decay expense. With -- relatedly, we purchased $8 billion of MSRs in the first quarter, $2 billion of which was on our system as of March 31 and $6 billion of which will transfer during the second quarter. This is consistent with our strategy to grow our servicing portfolio as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business.
Application activity was up 37% sequentially and was strong across both refinance and purchase clients. Given this, combined with the onset of the spring selling season, we would expect second quarter mortgage production income to increase from first quarter levels. Some of this will be partially offset by a decline in servicing income as decay expense, which is recorded at loan closing, will increase as the refinance application activity in the first quarter is closed in the second quarter.
Net interest income declined both sequentially and versus the prior year, driven by the decline in mortgage loan spreads given the low interest rate environment.
Expenses remain well controlled as continued focus on expense discipline and reduced credit-related expenses have funded investments to further improve efficiency and the client experience.
Net income declined $23 million sequentially, entirely due to a lower reserve release as the improvement in mortgage credit quality, while still ongoing, moderates.
Big picture, while the benefit from reserve releases within this business will decline, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence, delivering an improved client experience and gaining smart market share should continue to contribute to the earnings growth of the company.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

Thanks, Aleem. And to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we've had in place for several years now.
First, the diversity of our business model helped us deliver 5% revenue growth despite challenging market conditions. Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our strategic focus on improving efficiency and optimizing the balance sheet to enhance returns. These 2 strategies, which we've been working on since 2011, are key contributors to the 220 basis point reduction in the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio and the 21 basis point improvement in NIM.
This focus on expense management has also provided us the capacity to make consistent investments of the company. As an example, we continue to see the benefits of the investments we've been making in CIB over the last 10 years and are also encouraged by the results we're seeing from our commercial and CRE businesses.
Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating good momentum. Also, our digital investments continue to pay off in Consumer Banking with steady increases in mobile usage and self-service deposits. And in mortgage, we continue to make targeted investments for growth across both origination and servicing.
Lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce share count. Our goal is to continue this trend.
So big picture, our revenue trajectory is improving. Expenses remain well controlled. Credit quality outside of energy remains favorable, and our capital position is strong. So I'm pleased with the continued progress, and I remain highly optimistic about our company's future.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur to begin the Q&A portion."

Well, first of all, on swaps and amortization, yes, I'd characterize those as small helpers. If I think about 2016 relative to 2015, we're expecting -- because we were able to restructure part of our portfolio in 2015, we are expecting slightly lower levels of premium amortization in '16 relative to '15, but we're talking about sort of single-digit millions per quarter, these aren't big numbers. Likewise, if I think about the swap books, '16 relative to '15, most of the changes in our swap book have actually already taken place. So one of the reasons we took that slide out from here, Ken, is that we don't expect to see much change in swaps year-over-year from here. Most of the changes have already occurred. And so we really ought to be thinking about NIM and NII in total rather than sort of zooming in on one part of our interest rate risk management. That's the reason we took it out. And I don't think that those are sort of large numbers in the context of our overall rate risk and rate management perspective. To your point on NIM from here, the main -- we've got sort of several drivers why we're expecting a small grind-down in NIM from here. New production yields, still probably slightly lower than current portfolio yields. So as the portfolio turns over, that'll be a slight negative. Remember that the LCR requirement for banks our size goes up at the end of this year. And so as we build out our securities portfolio to meet the higher requirement at the end of this year, that'll be a slight drag on NIM, although it will be actually a little bit of a help to NII. And so those are a couple of reasons why you'll see probably slightly lower NIM, and NIM will grind down a little bit over the course of the year. But in context, if you think about the last several years, NIM was coming down at a pretty rapid pace. And we got good loan growth. We got good deposit growth. We were able to hold NII about flat over the last several years, even in the face of all of that declining NIM. So now that the pace of NIM decline is moderating as a result of that first Fed hike, I'm expecting that we'll see some NII improvements over the course of the year."

What I look at, as what you've asked about, is I look at pipelines and production. And pipelines and productions have been very consistent over the last several quarters. As I said earlier, production was a little higher this quarter, and then we didn't have some of the offsets and paydowns. So I think you're going to have some give and takes. So if we saw that go down the portfolio, to your point, I think CRE will be lower production. But that won't necessarily reflect itself on outstandings because we've had good production in the past. A lot of that is construction-related. People are completing their projects. There is less liquidity in the system, so that's liable to stay outstanding for a little bit longer than it had in the past. So there'll be some interesting offsets to CRE specifically. As we go to C&I, pipelines continue to be good. Our strategies are effective. We'll be very focused on return. So we'll be aggressive where we think we can get a lot of return, and we won't be as aggressive where we don't think we can get the appropriate return. Consumer, I can -- I think that'll continue to grow. You've seen the initiatives that we've had in place and the investments that we've made in Consumer. So as a production basis, that'll continue to grow sort of on the double-digit side but, again, a little bit offset by the runoff in home equity. So there are give and takes of all this, which is, again, why I'm sort of careful not to say loan growth as a number is the thing we want to give guidance around. But pipelines are healthy, and the strategies that we have in place are working."

If I think about going forward from here, though, the rest of the year, our overall energy reserves, I think, can play out a couple of different ways. Assuming there is no oil price shock, right, assuming that energy prices are relatively stable to where they are now, I think a couple of things are going to happen. One, our energy reserves can be relatively stable. As we have charge-offs, we continue to provide for those and maintain our reserve coverage about where it is. Or two, energy reserves could decline as we work through certain credits and as the formation of problem credits from here slows. So I think excluding a big decline in energy prices, I can see either of those scenarios from here."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis.
This quarter, we saw the benefits of our consistent strategic focus and improving execution, the combination of which resulted in revenue growth that exceeded expense growth. As we communicated during the last earnings call, delivering positive operating leverage in 2016 was going to be necessary to overcome our expectation of higher credit costs and to achieve our financial objectives.
Our performance in the first quarter was a good start towards meeting those objectives for the year. Specifically, we reported $0.84 per share, slightly lower than the fourth quarter given typical seasonal patterns in our business and, more importantly, up a solid 8% compared to a year ago. Total revenue was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. This sequential improvement was driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income, where we benefited from good performance across both mortgage and capital markets, the latter of which was notable given market conditions in January and February.
Our net interest margin improved 6 basis points sequentially and is up 21 basis points over the past year, reflecting our continued efforts to optimize the balance sheet, including improving our loan mix, growing deposits and reducing long-term debt, all while carefully managing duration.
Despite a modest increase in our expense base, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.3%, a full 220 basis points better than last year and represents the focus we have maintained on disciplined expense management, which has also created additional capacity to invest in our franchise.
Average loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. While loan growth will not likely sustain at this rate, I would characterize the overall economy and client activity levels as healthy, and we will remain focused on generating growth where returns are appropriate and we can create deeper client relationships.
Average deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our consumer, private wealth and wholesale businesses. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability.
Asset quality, excluding energy, remains strong as evidenced by a 25 basis point net charge-off ratio. However, the low oil price environment continues to pressure our energy clients, which contributed to the increase in nonperforming loans, our reserves and provision expense. We remain focused on being proactive around energy and, therefore, have increased the resources and intensity around mitigating our risk and helping our clients navigate through this downturn. However, we continue to view this risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 5% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Our strong capital position, combined with accumulative actions we've taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, should help us further increase capital returns to shareholders.
Our 2016 capital plan is now under review, and we'll have more to report on that outcome in late June.
So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,327146434,962018,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning.Moving to Slide 4, you can see that the net interest margin improved 6 basis points, primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term rat",2626,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning.
Moving to Slide 4, you can see that the net interest margin improved 6 basis points, primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term rates and partially offset by slightly higher funding costs.
Net interest income increased 3% sequentially, driven by the 6 basis point improvement in NIM and solid 2% loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin increased 21 basis points due to the same factors as the sequential drivers but also due to our continuous balance sheet management and optimization efforts. These efforts have resulted in a favorable shift in our loan portfolio mix, a significant reduction in higher-cost long-term debt, driven by low-cost deposit growth, and lower premium amortization expense in our securities portfolio.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016 and assuming there are no additional increases in the Fed funds rate, we expect net interest margin to decline by an average of a couple of basis points per quarter. If there are increases in the Fed funds rate, we would expect our net interest margin to benefit given our modestly asset-sensitive positions, with the amount of benefit dependent on the shape of the yield curve in addition to the broader competitive environment. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates.
Moving to Slide 5. Noninterest income increased $16 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage-related income resulting from a recent increase in refinancing activity.
Capital markets-related income was up modestly, a performance that was better than anticipated due to a strong March but also as a result of our continued long-term investments and market share gains in CIB.
Wealth management-related revenue declined $6 million sequentially due to challenging market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity.
Service charges on deposits were relatively flat from both the prior quarter and prior year. As a reminder, those will decline when we enhance our posting order process, which will reduce service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter beginning in Q4. And as Bill referenced earlier, the combination of the trends you saw on Slide 4 and Slide 5 resulted in total revenue that was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
Let's move on to expenses. Noninterest expense increased $30 million relative to the prior quarter, driven entirely by an $84 million increase in personnel expense as a result of the typical seasonal increases in FICA, incentives and 401(k) costs. Partially offsetting this increase were lower outside processing and software costs and legal and consulting expenses, partially due to normal quarterly variability.
In comparison to the first quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 3%, largely due to higher marketing expenses in addition to continued and targeted investments in our businesses. Separately, while our FDIC premium expense has been declining modestly over the past 2 years as our risk profile has improved, beginning in the third quarter, this expense category will increase by approximately $10 million per quarter given the FDIC's recently announced surcharge on large depository institutions. This incremental surcharge is anticipated to be effective for approximately 10 quarters.
As you can see on Slide 7, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.3% in the first quarter, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year as revenue growth exceeded expense growth, which was our goal coming into the year. Our first quarter progress, while early, puts us on pace to meet our objective of improving our efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year and, more importantly, demonstrates our intense focus on strong expense discipline and our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio.
Turning to Slide 8. Overall asset quality remained strong during the quarter as evidenced by net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, excluding the impact of energy, that are down 28% and 9%, respectively, year-over-year. However, as anticipated, the NPL ratio increased due to deterioration in the energy portfolio, which, when combined with loan growth, resulted in an $18 million increase in the total allowance for loan and lease losses.
With respect to the energy portfolio, we have provided some additional detail on this slide and more information on Slide 18 in the appendix. The energy portfolio remains stable at 2% of loans, with the composition also very similar to the prior quarter. Of note, E&P and oilfield services, the 2 sectors most impacted by low oil prices, represent only 38% of total energy loans, a mix we believe is favorable relative to the industry.
In addition, we migrated an additional $250 million of energy loans to nonperforming status and also increased our criticized accruing balances by $150 million, the net of which brings our criticized ratio to 29%, up from 19% in the prior quarter. Approximately 90% of this quarter's migration was concentrated in the E&P sector where collateral coverage remains healthy despite reserve base devaluations. And importantly, the vast majority of these loans were still current as of March 31. This migration and our allowance includes the effect of our internal risk review in addition to the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam.
Our energy-related provision expense in the quarter was approximately $30 million, half of which covered charge-offs and half of which was a reserve build, resulting in a 4.6% reserve ratio for total energy loans outstanding.
Our total energy reserves as a percentage of E&P and oilfield services are roughly 12%, which we believe is a more relevant measure that is responsive to portfolio mix.
As a reminder, our total reserves of $1.8 billion, which have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio, represent approximately 2x our nonperformers and 3.5x the midpoint of our 30 to 40 basis point net charge-off range for 2016. Big picture, while we have increased the resources and intensity around managing our exposure, we continue to view our energy-related risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.
From here, assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we would expect energy-related NPL formation to moderate as we have already taken significant action over the past few quarters. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016.
We also expect our ALLL-to-loans ratio to be relatively stable, which, when combined with our expectation for loan growth, should result in a total provision expense in 2016 that exceeds net charge-offs.
With regard to both charge-offs and provision expense, these are full year expectations and there may be some quarterly variability given the uncertainty of when certain credits will be resolved and the results of our rigorous allowance process.
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial real estate clients, while consumer loan growth was generally broad based. Our consumer direct strategy continues to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels.
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $4.9 billion or 4%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 20% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, payoffs in commercial real estate and a smaller indirect portfolio following our $1 billion indirect auto securitizations last June.
Turning to deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year with growth across most products and businesses. Our successful deposit growth strategy is the result of our commitment to meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and, ultimately, our teammates across all 3 business segments.
Rates paid on deposits increased 2 basis points sequentially given the increase in short-term rates. If interest rates rise further, this trend will continue. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. We've added approximately $700 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and held our estimated Basel III CET1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis at 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was up 5% sequentially and up 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. In addition, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds regulatory requirements.
This quarter, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and common stock warrants and paid a $0.24 dividend. We will repurchase an additional $175 million of common stock during the second quarter to complete our 2015 capital plan.
As Bill referenced, we submitted our 2016 capital plan just a couple of weeks ago, and we will disclose more on this matter once we are advised of the results.
As a result of our capital return program, we are driving down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The positive impact of our capital return program can be seen in year-over-year results, where 5% net income growth translated into 8% earnings per share growth as our long-term shareholders receive a slightly larger ownership stake every quarter. Over several years, the compounding effect of a lower share count, combined with our steadily increasing dividend, is an important component of our owners' long-term returns.
Moving to the segment overviews. Let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income decreased $15 million sequentially as continued market volatility resulted in lower wealth management-related income but was $30 million higher compared to the prior year as a result of higher net interest income and improved asset quality. Net interest income was stable sequentially and up 5% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, coupled with our continued focus on balance sheet optimization. More specifically, our direct consumer lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum, with average balances up $2 billion or 20% year-over-year as a result of the investments we've made in enhancing both our product offerings and client experience. In addition, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 2% sequentially and 3% versus the prior year.
Noninterest income was down 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year as our wealth management-related revenue streams have been pressured by market volatility and lower assets under management. Growing our wealth management business continues to be a key strategic priority for SunTrust, and we remain focused on retaining and recruiting top talent in efforts to both grow AUM and expand our client base.
Asset quality remains strong, with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. Going forward, we expect the improvements in the home equity portfolio to abate, thus resulting in increased provision expense associated with loan growth.
Noninterest expense increased 2% year-over-year due to continued investments in technology, higher marketing expenditures and growth in revenue-generating positions. The efficiency ratio was stable as revenue growth and cost-saving initiatives funded these investments. Over time, we continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness within this business as we realize the benefits of our technology investments and work to deepen client relationships and increase teammate productivity.
Moving on to Wholesale Banking, we had another solid quarter. Revenues were up 4% sequentially and year-over-year as a result of higher net interest income, driven by strong balance sheet growth and higher noninterest income.
Capital markets-related income was up $7 million sequentially and up modestly versus the prior year despite the decline in industry transaction volume. Our strong performance relative to the market is the direct result of our successful execution of 2 multiyear strategies: deepening client relationships and meeting the capital markets needs of all SunTrust clients.
Across both these fronts, we saw evidence of success in the first quarter. First, our average fee per transaction in the first quarter was up 16% compared to 2015, reflective of our increasingly prominent role on client transactions. Second, capital markets-related income generated by commercial, CRE and PWM clients was up $10 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. We expect these trends to continue as we bring our full capabilities and One Team approach to all SunTrust clients.
Net interest income continues its positive trajectory, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. This is primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth, the latter of which is driven by the increased value that our liquidity specialists are providing our clients and the investments we've made to enhance our treasury and payment product offerings.
Overall, revenue growth continues to outpace expense growth, resulting in 100 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio versus the prior year. This positive operating leverage has funded strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, including the build-out of our industry and corporate finance expertise within commercial banking, enhancements to our treasury platform, upgrades to our client-facing infrastructure and further talent acquisitions.
Despite the strong revenue growth, net income declined both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of increased provision expense, driven by loan growth, increased energy-related reserves and moderating asset quality improvements.
Looking ahead, while market conditions can be choppy and credit costs will normalize, our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated. Our broad product capabilities and industry expertise, combined with our One Team approach, will continue to bring increasing value to our clients and shareholders.
Moving to the mortgage segment, which has become a more steady contributor to the company's bottom line. Noninterest income increased 9% sequentially, driven by both production and servicing. The $7 million increase in production income is largely due to higher refinancing activity in reaction to the decline in rates we saw this quarter, which also enabled higher gain-on-sale margins.
Servicing income increased by $6 million due to improved net hedge performance and a lower decay expense. With -- relatedly, we purchased $8 billion of MSRs in the first quarter, $2 billion of which was on our system as of March 31 and $6 billion of which will transfer during the second quarter. This is consistent with our strategy to grow our servicing portfolio as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business.
Application activity was up 37% sequentially and was strong across both refinance and purchase clients. Given this, combined with the onset of the spring selling season, we would expect second quarter mortgage production income to increase from first quarter levels. Some of this will be partially offset by a decline in servicing income as decay expense, which is recorded at loan closing, will increase as the refinance application activity in the first quarter is closed in the second quarter.
Net interest income declined both sequentially and versus the prior year, driven by the decline in mortgage loan spreads given the low interest rate environment.
Expenses remain well controlled as continued focus on expense discipline and reduced credit-related expenses have funded investments to further improve efficiency and the client experience.
Net income declined $23 million sequentially, entirely due to a lower reserve release as the improvement in mortgage credit quality, while still ongoing, moderates.
Big picture, while the benefit from reserve releases within this business will decline, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence, delivering an improved client experience and gaining smart market share should continue to contribute to the earnings growth of the company.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

Thanks, Aleem. And to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we've had in place for several years now.
First, the diversity of our business model helped us deliver 5% revenue growth despite challenging market conditions. Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our strategic focus on improving efficiency and optimizing the balance sheet to enhance returns. These 2 strategies, which we've been working on since 2011, are key contributors to the 220 basis point reduction in the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio and the 21 basis point improvement in NIM.
This focus on expense management has also provided us the capacity to make consistent investments of the company. As an example, we continue to see the benefits of the investments we've been making in CIB over the last 10 years and are also encouraged by the results we're seeing from our commercial and CRE businesses.
Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating good momentum. Also, our digital investments continue to pay off in Consumer Banking with steady increases in mobile usage and self-service deposits. And in mortgage, we continue to make targeted investments for growth across both origination and servicing.
Lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce share count. Our goal is to continue this trend.
So big picture, our revenue trajectory is improving. Expenses remain well controlled. Credit quality outside of energy remains favorable, and our capital position is strong. So I'm pleased with the continued progress, and I remain highly optimistic about our company's future.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur to begin the Q&A portion."

If I think about 2016 relative to 2015, we're expecting -- because we were able to restructure part of our portfolio in 2015, we are expecting slightly lower levels of premium amortization in '16 relative to '15, but we're talking about sort of single-digit millions per quarter, these aren't big numbers. Likewise, if I think about the swap books, '16 relative to '15, most of the changes in our swap book have actually already taken place. So one of the reasons we took that slide out from here, Ken, is that we don't expect to see much change in swaps year-over-year from here. Most of the changes have already occurred. And so we really ought to be thinking about NIM and NII in total rather than sort of zooming in on one part of our interest rate risk management. That's the reason we took it out. And I don't think that those are sort of large numbers in the context of our overall rate risk and rate management perspective. To your point on NIM from here, the main -- we've got sort of several drivers why we're expecting a small grind-down in NIM from here. New production yields, still probably slightly lower than current portfolio yields. So as the portfolio turns over, that'll be a slight negative. Remember that the LCR requirement for banks our size goes up at the end of this year. And so as we build out our securities portfolio to meet the higher requirement at the end of this year, that'll be a slight drag on NIM, although it will be actually a little bit of a help to NII. And so those are a couple of reasons why you'll see probably slightly lower NIM, and NIM will grind down a little bit over the course of the year. But in context, if you think about the last several years, NIM was coming down at a pretty rapid pace. And we got good loan growth. We got good deposit growth. We were able to hold NII about flat over the last several years, even in the face of all of that declining NIM. So now that the pace of NIM decline is moderating as a result of that first Fed hike, I'm expecting that we'll see some NII improvements over the course of the year."

Net interest income, as I said earlier to Ken, I expect we're actually going to see a -- growth in net interest income, irrespective of rates. And to the extent that we do get some rate hikes, that growth will accelerate. The industry's ability to grow noninterest income, I think, has been pressured in the past. But I think you're seeing us and other players also look for other businesses and other ways to meet more client needs to grow that. And of course, efficiency. Just improving productivity, improving our overall efficiency, that -- all of those things are helping grow ROA to the extent that we are then able to take that growth in ROA and translate that to accelerating growth in ROE, managing capital as best as we can. Obviously, that is not all in our hands. But you've seen payout ratios grow pretty substantially over the last several years. In our case, last year, we were in the sort of mid-60% payout ratio, still lower than we would like. But our ability to grow payout ratio when returned capital will be one of those levers of many that I think -- where we'll be able to grow ROE over time."

What I look at is what you've asked about, is I look at pipelines and production. And pipelines and productions have been very consistent over the last several quarters. As I said earlier, production was a little higher this quarter, and then we didn't have some of the offsets and paydowns. So I think you're going to have some give and take. So if we sort of go down the portfolio, to your point, I think CRE will be lower production. But that won't necessarily reflect itself in outstandings because we've had good production in the past. A lot of that is construction-related. People are completing their projects. There is less liquidity in the system, so that's liable to stay outstanding for a little bit longer than it had in the past. So there'll be some interesting offsets to CRE, specifically. As we go to C&I, pipelines continue to be good. Our strategies are effective. We'll be very focused on return. So we'll be aggressive where we think we can get a lot of return, and we won't be as aggressive where we don't think we can get the appropriate return. Consumer, I can -- I think that'll continue to grow. You've seen the initiatives that we've had in place and the investments that we've made in Consumer. So as a production basis, that'll continue to grow sort of on the double-digit side but, again, a little bit offset by the runoff in home equity. So there are give and takes of all this, which is, again, why I'm sort of careful not to say loan growth as a number is the thing we want to give guidance around. But pipelines are healthy, and the strategies that we have in place are working."

I don't think that there's much of a change to that. With stable revenues, I would be thinking -- I would continue to think about expenses averaging, and I say that carefully, averaging between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion but might get quarters higher or quarters lower.

If I think about going forward from here, though, the rest of the year, our overall energy reserves, I think, can play out a couple of different ways. Assuming there is no oil price shock, right, assuming that energy prices are relatively stable to where they are now, I think a couple of things can happen. One, our energy reserves can be relatively stable. As we have charge-offs, we continue to provide for those and maintain our reserve coverage about where it is. Or two, energy reserves could decline as we work through certain credits and as the formation of problem credits from here slows. So I think excluding a big decline in energy prices, I can see either of those scenarios from here."

Let me begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some p",576,"All right, thank, Ankur, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. To start, I'm pleased with the results we deliver this quarter. For several years, we've been on a path to grow and diversify the business, improve profitability and increase our capital return to shareholders. This quarter, you saw our continued progress in each of these areas, specifically our ongoing commitment to invest in revenue growth opportunities, while also tightly managing expenses resulted in solid improvements in efficiency. Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan, which calls for a 23% increase in total capital return relative to our 2015 plan. This is a result of our strong capital position and improved financial performance and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. 
So getting into the specifics, we reported $0.94 of earnings per share this quarter, which included certain discrete items that netted to a $0.05 benefit to the bottom line but which did not meaningfully impact the current quarter's efficiency ratio. Aleem will provide some more detail on these items later but thematically, they help better position our company for the future, particularly as it relates to optimizing our branch delivery network. Excluding these items and the $0.03 of discrete tax benefits from a year ago, EPS increased 3%, a solid performance, particularly given the $120 million year-over-year increase in loan loss provision. This performance was supported by strong revenue growth, as total revenues grew 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was driven by higher noninterest income and the year-over-year improvement was driven largely by increased net interest income, reflecting the diversity of our business model. This revenue growth, combined with tightly controlled expenses, resulted in a 60.1% tangible efficiency ratio this quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to both prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up slightly compared to the first quarter, as solid loan growth offset the 5 basis point decline in NIM. Noninterest income was up nearly $120 million sequentially, reflecting the strong execution in both favorable and volatile markets by our mortgage and investment banking teams. Average loan and deposit growth this quarter was 2% and 3%, respectively, driven by solid economic conditions in our markets, combined with the onboard investments we've made and continue to make in our businesses. As anticipated, we continue to resolve problem energy credits, which drove the 40 basis point sequential increase in net charge-offs and the 3 basis point decline in the NPL ratio. 
Outside of energy, asset quality remains very strong, as evidenced by only 19 basis points of net charge-offs for the rest of the bank. Tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 12% from the prior year and our fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio declined slightly to 9.7%, all reflective of continued improvements in profitability, combined with effective capital deployment. The course we've set has us performing at a high level and will continue to for propel us into the future. So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over Aleem to provide more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,346347379,1010499,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to slide 4 and taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 basi",2309,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to slide 4 and taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 basis points, primarily due to lower earning asset yields, as the decline in long-term rates increased premium amortization expense and the low level of absolute rates lowered reinvestment rates across multiple asset classes. In addition, increased long-term debt, combined with slightly higher deposit costs contributed to 2 basis points of the sequential decline. However, net interest income increased $6 million from the prior quarter, as a solid 2% average loan growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming the static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline a further 3 to 5 basis points next quarter. This potential decline is more than we previously anticipated, largely due to the significant flattening of the yield curve over the past few months. 
We are continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving to Slide 5. Noninterest income increased $117 million sequentially, driven by mortgage, which benefited from lower rates, other noninterest income and capital markets. Mortgage production income increased $51 million, benefiting from strong increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. In addition, we simplified our product offering to include upfront origination fees in the all-in loan yield rather than as a separate fee. This change modestly impacts the timing of revenue recognition and increased this quarter's mortgage production income by approximately $10 million. Other noninterest income increased $37 million, primarily due to a gain associated with the sale-leaseback of one of our office buildings, which further supports our strategy to reduce our real estate footprint and provides us with increased flexibility in the future.
Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenues increasing $28 million, as we continued to see the combination of our long-term investments and strategy to deliver solid results for our clients and shareholders. Partially offsetting this increase was a $21 million decrease in trading income, which was largely driven by higher CVA costs, due both to a change in our methodology for calculating counterparty reserves for derivatives and as a result of lower rates. Client-related transaction fees, which includes service charges, card fees and other fees, increased $25 million from the prior quarter, not only due to typical seasonal patterns but also due to an increase in loan commitment fees in STRH associated with M&A-related bridge financing. Separately as a reminder, once we fully implement our enhanced posting order process in Q4 of this year, we will see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter. Let's move on to expenses.
Noninterest expense increased $27 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to discrete charges associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives. These charges were recorded in other noninterest expense and are generally associated with our ongoing branch network optimization efforts. While the savings from these efforts will not be material in the context of our total expense base, they will help continue to make us a more effective company. In addition, FDIC premium and regulatory exam expenses increased $8 million due to higher assessment fees, primarily due to a growing deposit base and a higher assessment rate, the latter of which is mostly due to the increase in nonperforming energy loans in recent quarters. As a reminder, assessment costs will increase an additional $10 million in the third quarter as a result of the FDIC's new surcharge. Partially offsetting these increases were lower employee compensation expenses, marketing expenses and net occupancy expenses, the latter of which included $6 million of discrete benefits. In comparison to the second quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 1%, largely due to the same discrete charges.
As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 60.1% in the second quarter, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. While this quarter's performance was strong, we do not believe a 60% efficiency ratio is our new run rate for the remainder of this year. With that said, our year-to-date progress keeps us on track to meet our objective of improving efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year.
The continued low interest rate environment will clearly impact our go-forward trajectory. However, we remain committed to maintaining strong expense discipline and achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Turning to Slide 8, asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters, with the divergence between energy and nonenergy-related performance. Excluding energy, our loan portfolio continues to perform very well, evidenced by charge-offs of only 19 basis points in the second quarter and stable to slightly improving delinquency levels. With respect to energy, we charged off $70 million of loans and our nonperforming loans declined from $420 million to $354 million. The total criticized ratio, which includes nonaccrual loans and criticized accruing loans, remained relatively stable at 30%.
Total ALLL for the company was relatively flat from the prior quarter as growth in the total loan portfolio was offset by continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. Total provision expense increased $45 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the energy charge-offs. From here, and assuming no significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we expect NPL levels to decline as we resolve existing energy NPLs. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect our allowance to be relatively stable in the near term, which should result in a provision expense that approximates net charge-offs. In addition, we expect energy charge-offs to abate as we move through the remainder of 2016 and thus, we do expect the total provision expense to decline relative to the second quarter level.
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial construction, while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our Consumer Lending strategies continued to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels. In addition, our overall lending pipelines and dialogue with clients continue to be solid, which we believe is reflective of a steady U.S. economy. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.1 billion or 6%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 15% growth in total consumer loans and was partially offset by declines in home equity and payoffs in commercial real estate. 
Turning to Slide 10, average client deposits increased 3% compared to the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year, partially due to a large temporary deposit associated with a client-related M&A transaction but largely due to core growth across most products and businesses. Period-end deposits were stable sequentially, given typical seasonal patterns from Q1 to Q2. Over the past 2 years, client deposits are up 15%. This success is the result of our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investment in technology platforms and ultimately, our teammates in both the Consumer and Private Wealth and Wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a lag effect of the December rate increase. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside the rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital positions. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2016 CCAR process, and our relative performance within that bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust's continuing to have amongst the lowest levels of loan losses and capital erosion in a severely adverse economic scenario, relative to other CCAR banks. This progress reflects the significant and cumulative actions we've taken over the past 5 years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of new loan production. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $960 million over the coming 4 quarters. In addition, we will increase our common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.26, subject to board approval. In total, this represents a 23% increase in total capital return to shareholders relative to our previous plan. Alongside our increases in capital return, we've also organically added approximately $500 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially and up 12% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements and we added approximately $1 billion to our securities portfolio and the second quarter to make further progress toward the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving to the segment overviews, we'll, begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income declined $10 million sequentially and $38 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a higher provision expense and discrete expenses recognized in the current quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net income trends were also negatively impacted by lower Wealth Management-related income. Net interest income was stable sequentially and was up 4% versus the prior year, as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, which more than offsets the lower net interest margin. Our consumer direct lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum. Specifically, average balances are up $2.7 billion or 26% year-over-year as a result of the investments we have made, in addition to market share gains we've been able to take in certain businesses resulting from our strong and stable funding base. 
Further, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 4% sequentially and 6% versus the prior year. Some of this growth is due to the large temporary client deposit I mentioned earlier, but the majority of it reflects our emphasis on delivering the bank's full capabilities to all of our clients. 
Both the solid loan and deposit growth trends in CPWM over the past couple of years reflect the increased momentum this business has created in acquiring new clients and deepening existing relationships. Noninterest income was up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction-related fees due to increased consumer activity and normal seasonality. The year-over-year decline was a driven by lower Wealth Management-related revenue, which has been pressured by lower assets under management and heightened market volatility. Noninterest expense increased 2% and 4% on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by discrete charges in the current quarter related to our branch network optimization efforts, which I discussed earlier in the presentation. Optimizing our network continues to be a critical strategic priority so that we continue to serve our clients when, where and how they want to do business.
In conjunction with branch optimization, profitably growing our Consumer Lending and Wealth Management business remains a primary focus in this segment. Executing these priorities should result in steady improvements in both efficiency and the client experience over time. 
Moving to Wholesale Banking, increased credit costs continue to put some downward pressure on net income, but overall client activity levels and market share continue to improve. Revenues were up 1% sequentially, due entirely to higher investment banking income. Within investment banking, we had a record quarter in both investment-grade bonds and equity originations. The growth of both of these businesses is a strong reflection of the continued strategic investments we've made in recent years. As an example, we increased the number of publishing equity research analysts by 30% over the past 2 years. And as a result of our broker rankings, have improved -- as a result, our broker rankings have improved and our equity-related revenue is growing.
Offsetting the increase in investment banking income was a $20 million sequential decline in trading income. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the higher CVA costs I discussed earlier, and excluding this, we would characterize core client trading activity in the second quarter as solid. 
Moving to the Mortgage segment, which was a key contributor to our performance this quarter, noninterest income increased $41 million sequentially and $60 million year-over-year. Sequential increase was driven entirely by production income, which was up $51 million as a result of greater purchase and refinancing activity, in addition to higher gain-on-sale margins. As anticipated, servicing income declined $10 million sequentially, as a result of the increased decay expense related to elevated refinancing activity. This was partially offset by additional servicing fees, driven by growth in the servicing portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, servicing income increased $22 million due to improved hedge performance and a 6% increase in the size of our service for others portfolio. These increases in noninterest income, combined with strong expense management, drove the $19 million sequential and $6 million year-over-year increase in the bottom line.
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity points to continued positive momentum in mortgage production volumes in response to the low rate environment. While we do not expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate meaningful improvement relative to the third quarter of last year. At a higher level, we continue to be pleased with the increased consistency, improved execution and targeted growth the mortgage business is delivering to our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 7% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and across all 3 major business segments. In addition, our businesses are working better to deliver the entire bank to our clients. 
Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our commitment to tightly manage expenses and drive positive operating leverage. We've improved the year-to-date efficiency ratio relative to 2015, putting as well on track to meet our commitment to improve efficiency on an annual basis for the fifth consecutive year. Third, we've been using many of these efficiency gains to fund growth investments in the company. So as an example, this quarter was our second best quarter ever for investment banking. We're particularly encouraged by the growth of our core advisory businesses, which take a long time to develop and are the product of over 10 years of investment. Today, equity and M&A-related revenue account for 39% of investment banking income, which was our highest percentage ever. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology, which has resulted in solid growth and allows us to capitalize on the current market conditions. Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment for the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum. Also, our investments in Consumer Banking, Private Wealth Management and Treasury & Payments Solutions are yielding strong results, with more clients entrusting their deposit and wealth with SunTrust. And lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce our share count, giving our long-term shareholders a higher ownership stake each quarter.
Now, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the continued low-rate environment, which will place pressure on net interest income and profitability trajectory, even though in the near term, it should be a tailwind to mortgage production and capital markets revenue and we are well positioned there. However, the low interest rate pressure is applicable to the entire industry, and I'm confident if we continue to execute our strategy, fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients, SunTrust will continue to sustain our outperformance. Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur and I believe we'll begin the Q&A."

Yes, if you recall at the start of the year, our view on rates overall was that we were only expecting one interest rate hike in 2016. And we expected that in the latter part of the year. Now with the impact of the low -- in the U.K, obviously, that rate hike looks like it's going to be less probable than we had originally anticipated. As a result, if we think about the drivers of NIM from here, we are expecting NIM to grind down a little bit in Q3, perhaps a little bit more in Q4. The main drivers of that would be new production yields across many of our portfolios are still a little bit lower than current portfolio levels. Another driver would be that we continue to build our securities portfolio to prepare for 2017 LCR requirements. So for those two reasons, NIM may continued to decline a little bit. But if you think about the last few years on net interest income, what you've seen with us, John, is that we've been able to use growth in loan and deposits to offset the declines in NIM over the last several years, right? Even though our NIM has dropped about 30, 35 basis points over the last few years, net interest income for us has been until last year, very flat. In the last year, with the growth in NIM, we were able to achieve net interest income really took off and we run a very steep upward sloping trajectory. From here on, with NIM starting to decline again, we do think that with the loan and deposit growth we've got, we will be able to grow net interest again. However, I'd say that it's going to be at a relatively low pace."

Yes, I think ther are several things why the efficiency ratio maybe a little bit higher in the second half than it was in this quarter. One, obviously, the NIM decline is going to put -- is going to have downward pressure on net interest income and we're going to be working hard to grow net interest income from here. But we know we've got some increased expenses coming up in the second half. FDIC assessment fees will go up $10 million a quarter starting in Q3. We've got -- remember we've got our posting order change coming in Q4, which will probably reduce our fee income by about $10 million a quarter starting in Q4. And then typically for us, outside processing and software is on a normal seasonal basis, it's normally a bit higher in the second half than it is in the first half as new applications come online over the course of the year and we start amortizing some of that cost. So for those reasons, I think the overall efficiency ratio maybe a little bit higher in the second half than in Q2, but year-over-year, I think is the big key. We know, and we've always targeted it the last 4 years, targeted improved efficiency year-over-year. So we've not actually focused on it much on an individual quarter basis. Our intent is to continue to make this company more effective and more efficient in the current year than it was in the past year and more effective and more efficient in the next year than it was this year. So this year, we still do expect to beat our efficiency ratio from last year and then we're going to be looking to see how we can continue to improve next year."

So what I look at is I look at production and then I look at loan sales and paydowns and then I look at utilization. So utilization was actually up, just to give a little data point. And generally, I'll talk a lot about utilization because it goes quarter-after-quarter, but this was the highest point in the last 7 yes, almost 8 quarters. So it's worth noting that's not a lot, but it's worth noting. Our production numbers for the quarter were actually really good. As a matter of fact, it was one of our higher quarters from a production standpoint but we also got a little bit of increase in paydowns. So that sort got of the net-net part of that. The C&I portfolio year-over-year has got great growth and again, quarter to quarter, we're sort of careful about that year-over-year as you know, good solid double-digit growth in C&I loans.

I want to with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some per",576,"All right, thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone. I want to with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
So to start, I'm pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. For several years, we've been on a path to grow and diversify the business, improve profitability and increase our capital return to shareholders. This quarter, you saw our continued progress in each of these areas, specifically, our ongoing commitment to invest in revenue growth opportunities while also tightly managing expenses resulted in solid improvements in efficiency. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan, which calls for a 23% increase in total capital return relative to our 2015 plan. This is a result of our strong capital position and improved financial performance and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. 
So getting into the specifics. We reported $0.94 of earnings per share this quarter, which included certain discrete items that netted to a $0.05 benefit to the bottom line, but which did not meaningfully impact the current quarter's efficiency ratio. Aleem will provide some more detail on these items later, but thematically, they help better position our company for the future, particularly as it relates to optimizing our branch delivery network. 
Excluding these items and the $0.03 of discrete tax benefits from a year ago, EPS increased 3%, a solid performance, particularly given the $120 million year-over-year increase in loan loss provision. This performance was supported by strong revenue growth, as total revenues grew 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was driven by higher noninterest income, and the year-over-year improvement was driven largely by increased net interest income, reflecting the diversity of our business model. This revenue growth, combined with tightly controlled expenses, resulted in a 60.1% tangible efficiency ratio this quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to both prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up slightly compared to the first quarter, as solid loan growth offset the 5 basis point decline in NIM. Noninterest income was up nearly $120 million sequentially, reflecting the strong execution in both favorable and volatile markets by our mortgage and investment banking teams. Average loan and deposit growth this quarter was 2% and 3%, respectively, driven by solid economic conditions in our markets, combined with the onboard investments we've made and continue to make in our businesses. 
As anticipated, we continue to resolve problem energy credits, which drove the 14 basis point sequential increase in net charge-offs and a 3 basis point decline in the NPL ratio. 
Outside of energy, asset quality remains very strong, as evidenced by only 19 basis points of net charge-offs for the rest of the bank. Tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 12% from the prior year, and our fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio declined slightly to 9.7%, all reflective of continued improvements in profitability, combined with effective capital deployment. 
The course we've set has us performing at a higher level and will continue to propel us into the future. 
So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over Aleem to provide more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,346347379,1010769,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to slide 4. And taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 b",2308,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. 
Let's move on to slide 4. And taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 basis points, primarily due to lower earning asset yields, as the decline in long-term rates increased premium amortization expense and the low level of absolute rates lowered reinvestment rates across multiple asset classes in addition, increased long-term debt, combined with slightly higher deposit costs contributed to 2 basis points of the sequential decline. However, net interest income increased $6 million from the prior quarter, as solid 2% average loan growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. 
Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline a further 3 to 5 basis points next quarter. This potential decline is more than we previously anticipated, largely due to the significant flattening of the yield curve over the past few months. We're continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving to Slide 5. Noninterest income increased $117 million sequentially, driven by mortgage, which benefited from lower rates, other noninterest income and capital markets. Mortgage production income increased $51 million, benefiting from strong increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. In addition, we simplified our product offering to include upfront origination fees in the all-in loan yield rather than as a separate fee. This change modestly impacts the timing of revenue recognition and increased this quarter's mortgage production income by approximately $10 million. Other noninterest income increased $37 million, primarily due to a gain associated with the sale-leaseback of one of our office buildings, which further supports our strategy to reduce our real estate footprint and provides us with increased flexibility in the future.
Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenues increasing $28 million, as we continue to see the combination of our long-term investments and strategy to deliver solid results for our clients and shareholders. Partially offsetting this increase was a $21 million decrease in trading income, which was largely driven by higher CVA costs, due both to a change in our methodology for calculating counterparty reserves for derivatives and as a result of lower rates. 
Client-related transaction fees, which include service charges, card fees and other fees, increased $25 million from the prior quarter, not only due to typical seasonal patterns but also due to an increase in loan commitment fees in STRH associated with M&A-related bridge financing. Separately as a reminder, once we fully implement our enhanced posting order process in Q4 of this year, we will see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter. 
Let's move on to expenses. Noninterest expense increased $27 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to discrete charges associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives. These charges were recorded in other noninterest expense and are generally associated with our ongoing branch network optimization efforts. While the savings from these efforts will not be material in the context of our total expense base, they will help continue to make us a more effective company. In addition, FDIC premium and regulatory exam expenses increased $8 million due to higher assessment fees, primarily due to a growing deposit base and a higher assessment rate, the latter of which is mostly due to the increase in nonperforming energy loans in recent quarters. As a reminder, assessment costs will increase an additional $10 million in the third quarter as a result of the FDIC's new surcharge. 
Partially offsetting these increases were lower employee compensation expenses, marketing expenses and net occupancy expenses, the latter of which included $6 million of discrete benefits. In comparison to the second quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 1%, largely due to these same discrete charges.
As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 60.1% in the second quarter, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. While this quarter's performance was strong, we do not believe a 60% efficiency ratio is our new run rate for the remainder of this year. With that said, our year-to-date progress keeps us on track to meet our objective of improving the efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year.
The continued low interest rate environment will clearly impact our go-forward trajectory. However, we remain committed to maintaining strong expense discipline and achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Turning to Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters, with a divergence between energy and nonenergy-related performance. Excluding energy, our loan portfolio continues to perform very well, evidenced by charge-offs of only 19 basis points in the second quarter and stable to slightly improving delinquency levels. With respect to energy, we charged off $70 million of loans, and our nonperforming loans declined from $420 million to $354 million. The total criticized ratio, which includes nonaccrual loans and criticized accruing loans, remained relatively stable at 30%.
Total ALLL for the company was relatively flat from the prior quarter, as growth in the total loan portfolio was offset by continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. Total provision expense increased $45 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the energy charge-offs. From here, and assuming no significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we expect NPL levels to decline as we resolve existing energy NPLs. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect our allowance to be relatively stable in the near term, which should result in a provision expense that approximates net charge-offs. In addition, we expect energy charge-offs to abate as we move through the remainder of 2016, and thus, we do expect the total provision expense to decline relative to the second quarter level.
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial construction, while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our Consumer Lending strategies continue to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels. In addition, our overall lending pipelines and dialogue with clients continue to be solid, which we believe is reflective of a steady U.S. economy. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.1 billion or 6%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 15% growth in total consumer loans, and was partially offset by declines in home equity and payoffs in commercial real estate. 
Turning to Slide 10, average client deposits increased 3% compared to the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year, partially due to a large temporary deposit associated with a client-related M&A transaction, but largely due to core growth across most products and businesses. Period-end deposits were stable sequentially, given typical seasonal patterns from Q1 to Q2. Over the past 2 years, client deposits are up 15%. This success is the result of our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms, and ultimately, our teammates, in both the Consumer and Private Wealth and Wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a lagged effect of the December rate increase. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside the rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2016 CCAR process, and our relative performance within that bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust continuing to have amongst the lowest levels of loan losses and capital erosion in a severely adverse economic scenario relative to other CCAR banks. This progress reflects the significant and cumulative actions we have taken over the past 5 years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of new loan production. 
The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $960 million over the coming 4 quarters. In addition, we will increase our common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.26, subject to board approval. In total, this represents a 23% increase in total capital return to shareholders relative to our previous plan. 
Alongside our increases in capital return, we've also organically added approximately $500 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially and up 12% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we added approximately $1 billion to our securities portfolio in the second quarter to make further progress toward the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income declined $10 million sequentially and $38 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a higher provision expense and discrete expenses recognized in the current quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net income trends were also negatively impacted by lower Wealth Management-related income. Net interest income was stable sequentially and was up 4% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth which more than offsets the lower net interest margin. Our consumer direct lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum. Specifically, average balances are up $2.7 billion or 26% year-over-year as a result of the investments we have made in addition to market share gains we've been able to take in certain businesses resulting from our strong and stable funding base. 
Further, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 4% sequentially and 6% versus the prior year. Some of this growth is due to the large temporary client deposit I mentioned earlier, but the majority of it reflects our emphasis on delivering the bank's full capabilities to all of our clients. 
Both the solid loan and deposit growth trends in CPWM over the past couple of years reflect the increased momentum this business has created in acquiring new clients and deepening existing relationships. Noninterest income was up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction-related fees due to increased consumer activity and normal seasonality. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower Wealth Management-related revenue, which has been pressured by lower assets under management and heightened market volatility. Noninterest expense increased 2% and 4% on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by discrete charges in the current quarter related to our branch network optimization efforts, which I discussed earlier in the presentation. 
Optimizing our network continues to be a critical strategic priority so that we continue to serve our clients when, where and how they want to do business. In conjunction with branch optimization, profitably growing our Consumer Lending and Wealth Management business remains a primary focus in this segment. Executing these priorities should result in steady improvements in both efficiency and the client experience over time. 
Moving to Wholesale Banking. Increased credit costs continue to put some downward pressure on net income, but overall client activity levels and market share continue to improve. Revenues were up 1% sequentially, due entirely to higher investment banking income. Within investment banking, we had a record quarter in both investment-grade bonds and equity originations. The growth of both of these businesses is a strong reflection of the continued strategic investments we've made in recent years. As an example, we've increased the number of publishing equity research analysts by 30% over the past 2 years. And as a result of our broker rankings, have improved -- as a result, our broker rankings have improved and our equity-related revenue is growing.
Offsetting the increase in investment banking income was a $20 million sequential decline in trading income. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the higher CVA costs I discussed earlier, and excluding this, we would characterize core client trading activity in the second quarter as solid. 
Moving to the Mortgage segment, which was a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Noninterest income increased $41 million sequentially and $60 million year-over-year. Sequential increase was driven entirely by production income, which was up $51 million as a result of greater purchase and refinancing activity in addition to higher gain-on-sale margins. As anticipated, servicing income declined $10 million sequentially as a result of the increased decay expense related to elevated refinancing activity. This was partially offset by additional servicing fees driven by growth in the servicing portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, servicing income increased $22 million due to improved hedge performance and a 6% increase in the size of our service for others portfolio. These increases in noninterest income, combined with strong expense management, drove the $19 million sequential and $6 million year-over-year increase in the bottom line.
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity points to continued positive momentum in mortgage production volumes in response to the low rate environment. While we do not expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate meaningful improvement relative to the third quarter of last year. At a higher level, we continue to be pleased with the increased consistency, improved execution and targeted growth the mortgage business is delivering to our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

So to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 7% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and across all 3 major business segments. In addition, our businesses are working better to deliver the entire bank to our clients. 
Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our commitment to tightly manage expenses and drive positive operating leverage. We've improved the year-to-date efficiency ratio relative to 2015, putting us well on track to meet our commitment to improve efficiency on an annual basis for the fifth consecutive year. 
Third, we've been using many of these efficiency gains to fund growth investments in the company. So as an example, this quarter was our second best quarter ever for investment banking. We're particularly encouraged by the growth of our core advisory businesses, which take a long time to develop and are the product of over 10 years of investment. Today, equity and M&A-related revenue account for 39% of investment banking income, which was our highest percentage ever. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology, which has resulted in solid growth and allows us to capitalize on the current market conditions. Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment for the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum. Also, our investments in Consumer Banking, Private Wealth Management and Treasury & Payments Solutions are yielding strong results, with more clients entrusting their deposits and wealth with SunTrust. 
And lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce our share count, giving our long-term shareholders a higher ownership stake each quarter.
Now I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the continued low-rate environment, which will place pressure on net interest income and profitability trajectory, even though in the near term, it should be a tailwind to mortgage production and capital markets revenue, and we are well positioned there. However, the low interest rate pressure is applicable to the entire industry, and I'm confident if we continue to execute our strategy, fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients, SunTrust will continue to sustain our outperformance. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur, and I believe we'll believe -- begin the Q&A."

Yes, if you recall at the start of the year, our view on rates overall was that we were only expecting one interest rate hike in 2016, and we expected that in the latter part of the year. Now with the impact of the low -- in the U.K, obviously, that rate hike looks like it's going to be less probable than we had originally anticipated. As a result, if we think about the drivers of NIM from here, we are expecting NIM to grind down a little bit in Q3, perhaps a little bit more in Q4. The main drivers of that would be new production yields across many of our portfolios are still a little bit lower than current portfolio levels. Another driver would be that we continue to build our securities portfolio to prepare for 2017 LCR requirements. So for those 2 reasons, NIM may continue to decline a little bit. But if you think about the last few years on net interest income, what you've seen with us, John, is that we've been able to use growth in loans and deposits to offset the declines in NIM over the last several years, right? Even though our NIM has dropped about 30, 35 basis points over the last few years, net interest income for us has been, until last year, very flat. In the last year, with the growth in NIM we were able to achieve, net interest income really took off, and we run a very steep upward sloping trajectory. From here on, with NIM starting to decline again, we do think that with the loan and deposit growth we've got, we will be able to grow net interest income again. However, I'd say that it's going to be at a relatively low pace."

But we've stressed this portfolio. We've looked at it hard, we've looked at used car values and all the things that could happen to the portfolio and feel good about where we're positioned. Again, we don't do subprime auto, so we sort of stayed at a different place as it relates to that. And then as it relates to the LightStream business and GreenSky, I mean, remember again, superprime business, FICO scores 750 to 770, kind of on the high end of the range. And similarly there, we're seeing continued strong credit performance. Consumer's in good shape, I mean, particularly at the prime and the superprime level.

Yes, I think there's just several things why the efficiency ratio may be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in this quarter. One, obviously, the NIM decline is going to put -- is going to have some downward pressure on net interest income, and we're going to be very -- working hard to grow net interest income from here. But we know we've got some increased expenses coming up in the second half. FDIC assessment fees will go up $10 million a quarter starting in Q3. We've got -- remember, we've got our posting order change coming in Q4, which will probably reduce our fee income by about $10 million a quarter starting in Q4. And then typically for us, outside processing and software is -- on a normal seasonal basis, is normally a little bit higher in the second half than it is in the first half as new applications come online over the course of the year and we start amortizing some of that cost. So for those reasons, I think the overall efficiency ratio may be a little bit higher in the second half than in Q2. But year-over-year, I think, is the big key. We know, and we've always target over the last 4 years, targeted improved efficiency year-over-year. So we've not actually focused on it much on an individual quarter basis. Our intent is to continue to make this company more effective and more efficient in the current year than it was in the past year and more effective and more efficient in the next year than it was this year. So this year, we still do expect to beat our efficiency ratio from last year. And then we're going to be looking to see how we can continue to improve next year."

So what I look at is I look at production and then I look at loan sales and paydowns and then I look at utilization. So utilization was actually up, just to give a little data point. And generally, I don't talk a lot about utilization because it goes quarter-to-quarter, but this was the highest point in the last several -- almost 8 quarters. So it's worth noting. Now it's not a lot, but it's worth noting that that's up. Our production numbers for the quarter were actually really good. Matter of fact, it was one of our higher quarters from a production standpoint, but we also got a little bit of increase in paydowns. So that sort got of the net-net part of that. The C&I portfolio year-over-year has got great growth. And again, quarter to quarter, we're sort of careful about that, but year-over-year as you know, good solid double-digit growth in C&I loans. As it relates to CRE, I think I've said this before, we -- on the production side, we're down. I mean, that's somewhat market-driven and somewhat driven by our own desires. But outstandings are going to go up a little bit, and I think that will trend that way for several quarters as the velocity of construction loans sort of staying on the books a little bit longer, by the way which we're happy with, high-quality, well underwritten. We're happy with, but the velocity of getting those off the books is going to slow a little bit. And part of that, you saw sort of in those production numbers I talked about."

We've been well under our 40 basis point expectation for many quarters and we continue to stay there. And when I take a look at the credit profile of the new loans that are coming on our books across all 3 segments, those credit profiles continue to be very, very strong. Consumer FICOs, consumer lending FICOs continue to come on at well north of 750, in many cases, we're talking about 770, 780. And as you know, we're not a subprime lender.

I'm going to begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with",577,"All right, thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
So to start, I'm pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. For several years, we've been on a path to grow and diversify the business, improve profitability and increase our capital return to shareholders. This quarter, you saw our continued progress in each of these areas, specifically, our ongoing commitment to invest in revenue growth opportunities while also tightly managing expenses resulted in solid improvements in efficiency. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan, which calls for a 23% increase in total capital return relative to our 2015 plan. This is a result of our strong capital position and improved financial performance and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. 
So getting into the specifics. We reported $0.94 of earnings per share this quarter, which included certain discrete items that netted to a $0.05 benefit to the bottom line, but which did not meaningfully impact the current quarter's efficiency ratio. Aleem will provide some more detail on these items later, but thematically, they help better position our company for the future, particularly as it relates to optimizing our branch delivery network. 
Excluding these items and the $0.03 of discrete tax benefits from a year ago, EPS increased 3%, a solid performance, particularly given the $120 million year-over-year increase in loan loss provision. This performance was supported by strong revenue growth, as total revenues grew 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was driven by higher noninterest income, and the year-over-year improvement was driven largely by increased net interest income, reflecting the diversity of our business model. This revenue growth, combined with tightly controlled expenses, resulted in a 60.1% tangible efficiency ratio this quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to both prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up slightly compared to the first quarter as solid loan growth offset the 5 basis point decline in NIM. Noninterest income was up nearly $120 million sequentially reflecting the strong execution in both favorable and volatile markets by our mortgage and investment banking teams. Average loan and deposit growth this quarter was 2% and 3%, respectively, driven by solid economic conditions in our markets combined with the onboard investments we've made and continue to make in our businesses. 
As anticipated, we continue to resolve problem energy credits which drove the 14 basis point sequential increase in net charge-offs and a 3 basis point decline in the NPL ratio. 
Outside of energy, asset quality remains very strong as evidenced by only 19 basis points of net charge-offs for the rest of the bank. Tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 12% from the prior year and our fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio declined slightly to 9.7%, all reflective of continued improvements in profitability combined with effective capital deployment. 
The course we've set has us performing at a higher level and will continue to propel us into the future. 
So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over Aleem to provide more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,346347379,1010924,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to slide 4. And taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 b",2308,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. 
Let's move on to slide 4. And taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 basis points, primarily due to lower earning asset yields, as the decline in long-term rates increased premium amortization expense and the low level of absolute rates lowered reinvestment rates across multiple asset classes in addition, increased long-term debt, combined with slightly higher deposit costs contributed to 2 basis points of the sequential decline. However, net interest income increased $6 million from the prior quarter, as solid 2% average loan growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. 
Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline a further 3 to 5 basis points next quarter. This potential decline is more than we previously anticipated, largely due to the significant flattening of the yield curve over the past few months. We're continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving to Slide 5. Noninterest income increased $117 million sequentially, driven by mortgage, which benefited from lower rates, other noninterest income and capital markets. Mortgage production income increased $51 million, benefiting from strong increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. In addition, we simplified our product offering to include upfront origination fees in the all-in loan yield rather than as a separate fee. This change modestly impacts the timing of revenue recognition and increased this quarter's mortgage production income by approximately $10 million. Other noninterest income increased $37 million, primarily due to a gain associated with the sale-leaseback of one of our office buildings, which further supports our strategy to reduce our real estate footprint and provides us with increased flexibility in the future.
Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenues increasing $28 million, as we continue to see the combination of our long-term investments and strategy to deliver solid results for our clients and shareholders. Partially offsetting this increase was a $21 million decrease in trading income, which was largely driven by higher CVA costs, due both to a change in our methodology for calculating counterparty reserves for derivatives and as a result of lower rates. 
Client-related transaction fees, which include service charges, card fees and other fees, increased $25 million from the prior quarter, not only due to typical seasonal patterns but also due to an increase in loan commitment fees in STRH associated with M&A-related bridge financing. Separately, as a reminder, once we fully implement our enhanced posting order process in Q4 of this year we will see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter. 
Let's move on to expenses. Noninterest expense increased $27 million relative to the prior quarter primarily due to discrete charges associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives. These charges were recorded in other noninterest expense and are generally associated with our ongoing branch network optimization efforts. While the savings from these efforts will not be material in the context of our total expense base, they will help continue to make us a more effective company. In addition, FDIC premium and regulatory exam expenses increased $8 million due to higher assessment fees, primarily due to a growing deposit base and a higher assessment rate, the latter of which is mostly due to the increase in nonperforming energy loans in recent quarters. As a reminder, assessment costs will increase an additional $10 million in the third quarter as a result of the FDIC's new surcharge. 
Partially offsetting these increases were lower employee compensation expenses, marketing expenses and net occupancy expenses, the latter of which included $6 million of discrete benefits. In comparison to the second quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 1%, largely due to these same discrete charges.
As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 60.1% in the second quarter, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. While this quarter's performance was strong, we do not believe a 60% efficiency ratio is our new run rate for the remainder of this year. With that said, our year-to-date progress keeps us on track to meet our objective of improving the efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year.
The continued low interest rate environment will clearly impact our go-forward trajectory. However, we remain committed to maintaining strong expense discipline and achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Turning to Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters, with a divergence between energy and nonenergy-related performance. Excluding energy, our loan portfolio continues to perform very well, evidenced by charge-offs of only 19 basis points in the second quarter and stable to slightly improving delinquency levels. With respect to energy, we charged off $70 million of loans, and our nonperforming loans declined from $420 million to $354 million. The total criticized ratio, which includes nonaccrual loans and criticized accruing loans, remained relatively stable at 30%.
Total ALLL for the company was relatively flat from the prior quarter, as growth in the total loan portfolio was offset by continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. Total provision expense increased $45 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the energy charge-offs. From here, and assuming no significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we expect NPL levels to decline as we resolve existing energy NPLs. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect our allowance to be relatively stable in the near term, which should result in a provision expense that approximates net charge-offs. In addition, we expect energy charge-offs to abate as we move through the remainder of 2016, and thus, we do expect the total provision expense to decline relative to the second quarter level.
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial construction, while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our Consumer Lending strategies continue to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels. In addition, our overall lending pipelines and dialogue with clients continue to be solid, which we believe is reflective of a steady U.S. economy. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.1 billion or 6%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 15% growth in total consumer loans, and was partially offset by declines in home equity and payoffs in commercial real estate. 
Turning to Slide 10, average client deposits increased 3% compared to the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year, partially due to a large temporary deposit associated with a client-related M&A transaction, but largely due to core growth across most products and businesses. Period-end deposits were stable sequentially, given typical seasonal patterns from Q1 to Q2. Over the past 2 years, client deposits are up 15%. This success is the result of our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms, and ultimately, our teammates, in both the Consumer and Private Wealth and Wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a lagged effect of the December rate increase. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2016 CCAR process, and our relative performance within that bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust continuing to have amongst the lowest levels of loan losses and capital erosion in a severely adverse economic scenario relative to other CCAR banks. This progress reflects the significant and cumulative actions we have taken over the past 5 years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of new loan production. 
The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $960 million over the coming 4 quarters. In addition, we will increase our common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.26, subject to board approval. In total, this represents a 23% increase in total capital return to shareholders relative to our previous plan. 
Alongside our increases in capital return, we've also organically added approximately $500 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially and up 12% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we added approximately $1 billion to our securities portfolio in the second quarter to make further progress toward the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income declined $10 million sequentially and $38 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a higher provision expense and discrete expenses recognized in the current quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net income trends were also negatively impacted by lower Wealth Management-related income. Net interest income was stable sequentially and was up 4% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth which more than offsets the lower net interest margin. Our consumer direct lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum. Specifically, average balances are up $2.7 billion or 26% year-over-year as a result of the investments we have made in addition to market share gains we've been able to take in certain businesses resulting from our strong and stable funding base. 
Further, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 4% sequentially and 6% versus the prior year. Some of this growth is due to the large temporary client deposit I mentioned earlier, but the majority of it reflects our emphasis on delivering the bank's full capabilities to all of our clients. 
Both the solid loan and deposit growth trends in CPWM over the past couple of years reflect the increased momentum this business has created in acquiring new clients and deepening existing relationships. Noninterest income was up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction-related fees due to increased consumer activity and normal seasonality. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower Wealth Management-related revenue, which has been pressured by lower assets under management and heightened market volatility. Noninterest expense increased 2% and 4% on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by discrete charges in the current quarter related to our branch network optimization efforts, which I discussed earlier in the presentation. 
Optimizing our network continues to be a critical strategic priority so that we continue to serve our clients when, where and how they want to do business. In conjunction with branch optimization, profitably growing our Consumer Lending and Wealth Management business remains a primary focus in this segment. Executing these priorities should result in steady improvements in both efficiency and the client experience over time. 
Moving to Wholesale Banking. Increased credit costs continue to put some downward pressure on net income, but overall client activity levels and market share continue to improve. Revenues were up 1% sequentially, due entirely to higher investment banking income. Within investment banking, we had a record quarter in both investment-grade bonds and equity originations. The growth of both of these businesses is a strong reflection of the continued strategic investments we've made in recent years. As an example, we've increased the number of publishing equity research analysts by 30% over the past 2 years. And as a result of our broker rankings, have improved -- as a result, our broker rankings have improved and our equity-related revenue is growing.
Offsetting the increase in investment banking income was a $20 million sequential decline in trading income. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the higher CVA costs I discussed earlier, and excluding this, we would characterize core client trading activity in the second quarter as solid. 
Moving to the Mortgage segment, which was a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Noninterest income increased $41 million sequentially and $60 million year-over-year. Sequential increase was driven entirely by production income, which was up $51 million as a result of greater purchase and refinancing activity in addition to higher gain-on-sale margins. As anticipated, servicing income declined $10 million sequentially as a result of the increased decay expense related to elevated refinancing activity. This was partially offset by additional servicing fees driven by growth in the servicing portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, servicing income increased $22 million due to improved hedge performance and a 6% increase in the size of our service for others portfolio. These increases in noninterest income, combined with strong expense management, drove the $19 million sequential and $6 million year-over-year increase in the bottom line.
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to continued positive momentum in mortgage production volumes in response to the low rate environment. While we do not expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate meaningful improvement relative to the third quarter of last year. At a higher level, we continue to be pleased with the increased consistency, improved execution and targeted growth the mortgage business is delivering to our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

So to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. So first, the diversity of our business model help",427,"Okay, great, thanks, Aleem. So to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 7% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and across all 3 major business segments. In addition, our businesses are working better to deliver the entire bank to our clients. 
Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our commitment to tightly manage expenses and drive positive operating leverage. We've improved the year-to-date efficiency ratio relative to 2015, putting us well on track to meet our commitment to improve efficiency on an annual basis for the fifth consecutive year. 
Third, we've been using many of these efficiency gains to fund growth investments in the company. So as an example, this quarter was our second best quarter ever for investment banking. We're particularly encouraged by the growth of our core advisory businesses, which take a long time to develop and are the product of over 10 years of investment. Today, equity and M&A-related revenue account for 39% of investment banking income, which was our highest percentage ever. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology, which has resulted in solid growth and allows us to capitalize on the current market conditions. Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment for the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum. Also, our investments in Consumer Banking, Private Wealth Management and Treasury & Payments Solutions are yielding strong results, with more clients entrusting their deposits and wealth with SunTrust. 
And lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce our share count, giving our long-term shareholders a higher ownership stake each quarter.
Now I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the continued low-rate environment, which will place pressure on net interest income and profitability trajectory, even though in the near term, it should be a tailwind to mortgage production and capital markets revenue, and we are well positioned there. However, the low interest rate pressure is applicable to the entire industry, and I'm confident if we continue to execute our strategy, fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients, SunTrust will continue to sustain our outperformance. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur, and I believe we'll begin the Q&A."

Yes, if you recall at the start of the year, our view on rates overall was that we were only expecting one interest rate hike in 2016, and we expected that in the latter part of the year. Now with the impact of the low -- in the U.K., obviously, that rate hike looks like it's going to be less probable than we had originally anticipated. As a result, if we think about the drivers of NIM from here, we are expecting NIM to grind down a little bit in Q3, perhaps a little bit more in Q4. The main drivers of that would be new production yields across many of our portfolios are still a little bit lower than current portfolio levels. Another driver would be that we continue to build our securities portfolio to prepare for 2017 LCR requirements. So for those 2 reasons, NIM may continue to decline a little bit. But if you think about the last few years on net interest income, what you've seen with us, John, is that we've been able to use growth in loans and deposits to offset the declines in NIM over the last several years, right? Even though our NIM has dropped about 30, 35 basis points over the last few years, net interest income for us has been, until last year, very flat. In the last year, with the growth in NIM we were able to achieve, net interest income really took off, and we were on a very steep upward sloping trajectory. From here on, with NIM starting to decline again, we do think that with the loan and deposit growth we've got, we will be able to grow net interest income again. However, I'd say that it's going to be at a relatively low pace."

One, obviously, the NIM decline is going to put -- is going to have some downward pressure on net interest income, and we're going to be very -- working hard to grow net interest income from here. But we know we've got some increased expenses coming up in the second half. FDIC assessment fees will go up $10 million a quarter starting in Q3. We've got -- remember, we've got our posting order change coming in Q4, which will probably reduce our fee income by about $10 million a quarter starting in Q4. And then typically for us, outside processing and software is -- on a normal seasonal basis, is normally a little bit higher in the second half than it is in the first half as new applications come online over the course of the year and we start amortizing some of that cost. So for those reasons, I think the overall efficiency ratio may be a little bit higher in the second half than in Q2. But year-over-year, I think, is the big key. We know, and we've always targeted -- or for the last 4 years, targeted improved efficiency year-over-year. So we've not actually focused on it much on an individual quarter basis. Our intent is to continue to make this company more effective and more efficient in the current year than it was in the past year and more effective and more efficient in the next year than it was this year. So this year, we still do expect to beat our efficiency ratio from last year. And then we're going to be looking to see how we can continue to improve next year."

Matter of fact, it was one of our higher quarters from a production standpoint, but we also got a little bit of increase in paydowns. So that sort got of the net-net part of that. The C&I portfolio year-over-year has got great growth. And again, quarter to quarter, we're sort of careful about that, but year-over-year is, you know, good solid double-digit growth in C&I loans. 
As it relates to CRE, I think I've said this before, we -- on the production side, we're down. I mean, that's just -- that's somewhat market-driven and somewhat driven by our own desires. But outstandings are going to go up a little bit, and I think that will trend that way for several quarters as the velocity of construction loans sort of staying on the books a little bit longer, by the way which we're happy with -- high-quality, well underwritten. We're happy with, but the velocity of getting those off the books is going to slow a little bit. And part of that, you saw sort of in those production numbers I talked about."

But to your point, and I think this is where you're completely correct. This part has lasted a long time. We've been well under our 40 basis point expectation for many quarters and we continue to stay there. And when I take a look at the credit profile of the new loans that are coming on our books across all 3 segments, those credit profiles continue to be very, very strong. Consumer FICOs -- consumer lending FICOs continue to come on at well north of 750, in many cases, we're talking about 770, 780. And as you know, we're not a subprime lender. So the credit profile of what we're putting on continues to be very strong. I like what we're seeing in Wholesale Banking and what's coming on there.

I'm going to begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with",577,"All right, thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'm going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
So to start, I'm pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. For several years, we've been on a path to grow and diversify the business, improve profitability and increase our capital return to shareholders. This quarter, you saw our continued progress in each of these areas, specifically, our ongoing commitment to invest in revenue growth opportunities while also tightly managing expenses resulted in solid improvements in efficiency. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan, which calls for a 23% increase in total capital return relative to our 2015 plan. This is a result of our strong capital position and improved financial performance and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. 
So getting into the specifics. We reported $0.94 of earnings per share this quarter, which included certain discrete items that netted to a $0.05 benefit to the bottom line, but which did not meaningfully impact the current quarter's efficiency ratio. Aleem will provide some more detail on these items later, but thematically, they help better position our company for the future, particularly as it relates to optimizing our branch delivery network. 
Excluding these items and the $0.03 of discrete tax benefits from a year ago, EPS increased 3%, a solid performance, particularly given the $120 million year-over-year increase in loan loss provision. This performance was supported by strong revenue growth, as total revenues grew 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was driven by higher noninterest income, and the year-over-year improvement was driven largely by increased net interest income, reflecting the diversity of our business model. This revenue growth, combined with tightly controlled expenses, resulted in a 60.1% tangible efficiency ratio this quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to both prior quarter and prior year. 
Net interest income was up slightly compared to the first quarter as solid loan growth offset the 5 basis point decline in NIM. Noninterest income was up nearly $120 million sequentially reflecting the strong execution in both favorable and volatile markets by our mortgage and investment banking teams. Average loan and deposit growth this quarter was 2% and 3%, respectively, driven by solid economic conditions in our markets combined with the onboard investments we've made and continue to make in our businesses. 
As anticipated, we continue to resolve problem energy credits which drove the 14 basis point sequential increase in net charge-offs and a 3 basis point decline in the NPL ratio. 
Outside of energy, asset quality remains very strong as evidenced by only 19 basis points of net charge-offs for the rest of the bank. Tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 12% from the prior year and our fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio declined slightly to 9.7%, all reflective of continued improvements in profitability combined with effective capital deployment. 
The course we've set has us performing at a higher level and will continue to propel us into the future. 
So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over Aleem to provide more details on this quarter's performance."
305901,346347379,1011157,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to slide 4. And taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 b",2308,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. 
Let's move on to slide 4. And taking a look at that slide, you'll see that our net interest margin declined 5 basis points, primarily due to lower earning asset yields, as the decline in long-term rates increased premium amortization expense and the low level of absolute rates lowered reinvestment rates across multiple asset classes in addition, increased long-term debt, combined with slightly higher deposit costs contributed to 2 basis points of the sequential decline. However, net interest income increased $6 million from the prior quarter, as solid 2% average loan growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. 
Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline a further 3 to 5 basis points next quarter. This potential decline is more than we previously anticipated, largely due to the significant flattening of the yield curve over the past few months. We're continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving to Slide 5. Noninterest income increased $117 million sequentially, driven by mortgage, which benefited from lower rates, other noninterest income and capital markets. Mortgage production income increased $51 million, benefiting from strong increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. In addition, we simplified our product offering to include upfront origination fees in the all-in loan yield rather than as a separate fee. This change modestly impacts the timing of revenue recognition and increased this quarter's mortgage production income by approximately $10 million. Other noninterest income increased $37 million, primarily due to a gain associated with the sale-leaseback of one of our office buildings, which further supports our strategy to reduce our real estate footprint and provides us with increased flexibility in the future.
Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenues increasing $28 million, as we continue to see the combination of our long-term investments and strategy to deliver solid results for our clients and shareholders. Partially offsetting this increase was a $21 million decrease in trading income, which was largely driven by higher CVA costs, due both to a change in our methodology for calculating counterparty reserves for derivatives and as a result of lower rates. 
Client-related transaction fees, which include service charges, card fees and other fees, increased $25 million from the prior quarter, not only due to typical seasonal patterns but also due to an increase in loan commitment fees in STRH associated with M&A-related bridge financing. Separately, as a reminder, once we fully implement our enhanced posting order process in Q4 of this year we will see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter. 
Let's move on to expenses. Noninterest expense increased $27 million relative to the prior quarter primarily due to discrete charges associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives. These charges were recorded in other noninterest expense and are generally associated with our ongoing branch network optimization efforts. While the savings from these efforts will not be material in the context of our total expense base, they will help continue to make us a more effective company. In addition, FDIC premium and regulatory exam expenses increased $8 million due to higher assessment fees, primarily due to a growing deposit base and a higher assessment rate, the latter of which is mostly due to the increase in nonperforming energy loans in recent quarters. As a reminder, assessment costs will increase an additional $10 million in the third quarter as a result of the FDIC's new surcharge. 
Partially offsetting these increases were lower employee compensation expenses, marketing expenses and net occupancy expenses, the latter of which included $6 million of discrete benefits. In comparison to the second quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 1%, largely due to these same discrete charges.
As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 60.1% in the second quarter, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. While this quarter's performance was strong, we do not believe a 60% efficiency ratio is our new run rate for the remainder of this year. With that said, our year-to-date progress keeps us on track to meet our objective of improving the efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year.
The continued low interest rate environment will clearly impact our go-forward trajectory. However, we remain committed to maintaining strong expense discipline and achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Turning to Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters, with a divergence between energy and nonenergy-related performance. Excluding energy, our loan portfolio continues to perform very well, evidenced by charge-offs of only 19 basis points in the second quarter and stable to slightly improving delinquency levels. With respect to energy, we charged off $70 million of loans, and our nonperforming loans declined from $420 million to $354 million. The total criticized ratio, which includes nonaccrual loans and criticized accruing loans, remained relatively stable at 30%.
Total ALLL for the company was relatively flat from the prior quarter, as growth in the total loan portfolio was offset by continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. Total provision expense increased $45 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the energy charge-offs. From here, and assuming no significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we expect NPL levels to decline as we resolve existing energy NPLs. We continue to expect the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect our allowance to be relatively stable in the near term, which should result in a provision expense that approximates net charge-offs. In addition, we expect energy charge-offs to abate as we move through the remainder of 2016, and thus, we do expect the total provision expense to decline relative to the second quarter level.
Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter, with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial construction, while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our Consumer Lending strategies continue to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels. In addition, our overall lending pipelines and dialogue with clients continue to be solid, which we believe is reflective of a steady U.S. economy. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.1 billion or 6%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 15% growth in total consumer loans, and was partially offset by declines in home equity and payoffs in commercial real estate. 
Turning to Slide 10, average client deposits increased 3% compared to the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year, partially due to a large temporary deposit associated with a client-related M&A transaction, but largely due to core growth across most products and businesses. Period-end deposits were stable sequentially, given typical seasonal patterns from Q1 to Q2. Over the past 2 years, client deposits are up 15%. This success is the result of our increased focus on meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms, and ultimately, our teammates, in both the Consumer and Private Wealth and Wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a lagged effect of the December rate increase. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2016 CCAR process, and our relative performance within that bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust continuing to have amongst the lowest levels of loan losses and capital erosion in a severely adverse economic scenario relative to other CCAR banks. This progress reflects the significant and cumulative actions we have taken over the past 5 years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of new loan production. 
The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $960 million over the coming 4 quarters. In addition, we will increase our common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.26, subject to board approval. In total, this represents a 23% increase in total capital return to shareholders relative to our previous plan. 
Alongside our increases in capital return, we've also organically added approximately $500 million of Common Equity Tier 1 over the past year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially and up 12% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI as a result of lower long-term interest rates. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we added approximately $1 billion to our securities portfolio in the second quarter to make further progress toward the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income declined $10 million sequentially and $38 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a higher provision expense and discrete expenses recognized in the current quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net income trends were also negatively impacted by lower Wealth Management-related income. Net interest income was stable sequentially and was up 4% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth which more than offsets the lower net interest margin. Our consumer direct lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum. Specifically, average balances are up $2.7 billion or 26% year-over-year as a result of the investments we have made in addition to market share gains we've been able to take in certain businesses resulting from our strong and stable funding base. 
Further, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 4% sequentially and 6% versus the prior year. Some of this growth is due to the large temporary client deposit I mentioned earlier, but the majority of it reflects our emphasis on delivering the bank's full capabilities to all of our clients. 
Both the solid loan and deposit growth trends in CPWM over the past couple of years reflect the increased momentum this business has created in acquiring new clients and deepening existing relationships. Noninterest income was up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction-related fees due to increased consumer activity and normal seasonality. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower Wealth Management-related revenue, which has been pressured by lower assets under management and heightened market volatility. Noninterest expense increased 2% and 4% on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by discrete charges in the current quarter related to our branch network optimization efforts, which I discussed earlier in the presentation. 
Optimizing our network continues to be a critical strategic priority so that we continue to serve our clients when, where and how they want to do business. In conjunction with branch optimization, profitably growing our Consumer Lending and Wealth Management business remains a primary focus in this segment. Executing these priorities should result in steady improvements in both efficiency and the client experience over time. 
Moving to Wholesale Banking. Increased credit costs continue to put some downward pressure on net income, but overall client activity levels and market share continue to improve. Revenues were up 1% sequentially, due entirely to higher investment banking income. Within investment banking, we had a record quarter in both investment-grade bonds and equity originations. The growth of both of these businesses is a strong reflection of the continued strategic investments we've made in recent years. As an example, we've increased the number of publishing equity research analysts by 30% over the past 2 years. And as a result of our broker rankings, have improved -- as a result, our broker rankings have improved and our equity-related revenue is growing.
Offsetting the increase in investment banking income was a $20 million sequential decline in trading income. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the higher CVA costs I discussed earlier, and excluding this, we would characterize core client trading activity in the second quarter as solid. 
Moving to the Mortgage segment, which was a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Noninterest income increased $41 million sequentially and $60 million year-over-year. Sequential increase was driven entirely by production income, which was up $51 million as a result of greater purchase and refinancing activity in addition to higher gain-on-sale margins. As anticipated, servicing income declined $10 million sequentially as a result of the increased decay expense related to elevated refinancing activity. This was partially offset by additional servicing fees driven by growth in the servicing portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, servicing income increased $22 million due to improved hedge performance and a 6% increase in the size of our service for others portfolio. These increases in noninterest income, combined with strong expense management, drove the $19 million sequential and $6 million year-over-year increase in the bottom line.
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to continued positive momentum in mortgage production volumes in response to the low rate environment. While we do not expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate meaningful improvement relative to the third quarter of last year. At a higher level, we continue to be pleased with the increased consistency, improved execution and targeted growth the mortgage business is delivering to our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives."

So to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 7% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and across all 3 major business segments. In addition, our businesses are working better to deliver the entire bank to our clients. 
Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our commitment to tightly manage expenses and drive positive operating leverage. We've improved the year-to-date efficiency ratio relative to 2015, putting us well on track to meet our commitment to improve efficiency on an annual basis for the fifth consecutive year. 
Third, we've been using many of these efficiency gains to fund growth investments in the company. So as an example, this quarter was our second best quarter ever for investment banking. We're particularly encouraged by the growth of our core advisory businesses, which take a long time to develop and are the product of over 10 years of investment. Today, equity and M&A-related revenue account for 39% of investment banking income, which was our highest percentage ever. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology, which has resulted in solid growth and allows us to capitalize on the current market conditions. Similarly, Consumer Lending has been another key area of investment for the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum. Also, our investments in Consumer Banking, Private Wealth Management and Treasury & Payments Solutions are yielding strong results, with more clients entrusting their deposits and wealth with SunTrust. 
And lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce our share count, giving our long-term shareholders a higher ownership stake each quarter.
Now I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the continued low-rate environment, which will place pressure on net interest income and profitability trajectory, even though in the near term, it should be a tailwind to mortgage production and capital markets revenue, and we are well positioned there. However, the low interest rate pressure is applicable to the entire industry, and I'm confident if we continue to execute our strategy, fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients, SunTrust will continue to sustain our outperformance. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ankur, and I believe we'll begin the Q&A."

Yes, if you recall at the start of the year, our view on rates overall was that we were only expecting one interest rate hike in 2016, and we expected that in the latter part of the year. Now with the impact of the low -- in the U.K., obviously, that rate hike looks like it's going to be less probable than we had originally anticipated. As a result, if we think about the drivers of NIM from here, we are expecting NIM to grind down a little bit in Q3, perhaps a little bit more in Q4. The main drivers of that would be new production yields across many of our portfolios are still a little bit lower than current portfolio levels. Another driver would be that we continue to build our securities portfolio to prepare for 2017 LCR requirements. So for those 2 reasons, NIM may continue to decline a little bit. But if you think about the last few years on net interest income, what you've seen with us, John, is that we've been able to use growth in loans and deposits to offset the declines in NIM over the last several years, right? Even though our NIM has dropped about 30, 35 basis points over the last few years, net interest income for us has been, until last year, very flat. In the last year, with the growth in NIM we were able to achieve, net interest income really took off, and we were on a very steep upward sloping trajectory. From here on, with NIM starting to decline again, we do think that with the loan and deposit growth we've got, we will be able to grow net interest income again. However, I'd say that it's going to be at a relatively low pace."

One, obviously, the NIM decline is going to put -- is going to have some downward pressure on net interest income, and we're going to be very -- working hard to grow net interest income from here. But we know we've got some increased expenses coming up in the second half. FDIC assessment fees will go up $10 million a quarter starting in Q3. We've got -- remember, we've got our posting order change coming in Q4, which will probably reduce our fee income by about $10 million a quarter starting in Q4. And then typically for us, outside processing and software is -- on a normal seasonal basis, is normally a little bit higher in the second half than it is in the first half as new applications come online over the course of the year and we start amortizing some of that cost. So for those reasons, I think the overall efficiency ratio may be a little bit higher in the second half than in Q2. But year-over-year, I think, is the big key. We know, and we've always targeted -- or for the last 4 years, targeted improved efficiency year-over-year. So we've not actually focused on it much on an individual quarter basis. Our intent is to continue to make this company more effective and more efficient in the current year than it was in the past year and more effective and more efficient in the next year than it was this year. So this year, we still do expect to beat our efficiency ratio from last year. And then we're going to be looking to see how we can continue to improve next year."

The C&I portfolio year-over-year has got great growth. And again, quarter to quarter, we're sort of careful about that, but year-over-year is, you know, good solid double-digit growth in C&I loans.

There's not a lot of crazy stuff going on, there's not a lot of land accumulation, there's not a lot of 2 guys and a truck and all the things that we got worried about. But our relative exposure is well-managed within that geography."

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
We reported $0.91 of earnings this quarter, which represents a 2% increase relative to the core earnings of the prior quarter and prior year. Overall, I'd characterize this as a good quarter. Revenue growth in particular was very strong, up 8% compared to the prior year and reflects the ongoing investments we've made in each of our businesses over the past 2 [ph] years. Noninterest income was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in mortgage and another record quarter in capital markets, which is clear that we are increasingly becoming a preferred strategic adviser to our clients. Net interest income was up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Our businesses remained focus on managing the balance sheet in a strategic profitable manner, which has allowed us to overcome much of the margin compression. The $1 billion auto loan sale we executed this quarter is fully consistent with our commitment to meet our clients' needs, while also optimizing the balance sheet by staying disciplined on returns. 
Overall, our strong revenue growth helped to offset the increase in expenses and keeps us on track to meet our goal of improving the efficiency of the company, evidenced by the fact that our year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to all of 2015. 
Now with that said, absolute expenses this quarter came in higher than I feel is acceptable. Some of this was related to revenue and some were anticipated increases, but overall, we did not fully demonstrate the strong expense control I think we're capable of. 
Asset quality improved as we made further progress in working through certain energy credits. The net charge-off ratio declined to 35 basis points, nonperforming loans were stable and provision expense declined. I consider our overall asset quality to be strong, which is a testament of the solid economic conditions in our markets and businesses and our continued underwriting discipline. 
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.7% on a BASEL III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Additionally, we began executing our 2016 capital plan this quarter, of which we will return 23% more capital to our shareholders relative to the previous plan. 
In addition, I'll highlight the acquisition of Pillar Financial, which was announced yesterday. As you've heard us say in the past, the types of acquisitions we're focused on today are businesses that complement and leverage our existing capabilities while also being accretive to our return profile. Pillar Financial does just that. They're a multifamily agency lending and servicing company that holds Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA licenses, which they [ph] originate to distribute focus. This acquisition broadens the capabilities of our commercial real estate team, increases the velocity of our balance sheet and allows us to meet more of our clients' permanent financing needs. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to provide an update regarding our onUp movement, which is focused on sparking a conversation with all Americans about money and giving them the tools and resources they need to move from financial stress to financial confidence. We formally launched this movement with our Super Bowl ad back in February, but it truly is an extension of our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial wellbeing. I'm pleased to announce that over 700,000 people have joined the movement by taking a first step towards financial confidence. This is just one symbol of our commitment to put our purpose in action every day. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem."
305901,382898384,1058520,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued",2181,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment, which negatively impacted both residential mortgage loan and security yields. In addition, the full effect of last quarter's subordinated debt issuance, along with slightly higher deposit costs, also contributed to the sequential decline. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR and further favorable mix shift in our loan portfolio as a result of our continuous balance sheet optimization efforts. 
Net interest income increased $19 million from prior quarter as solid 1% average loan and deposit growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline 2 to 3 basis points next quarter. We are continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving on to Slide 5. You can see that despite the recognition of $44 million in net asset-related gains last quarter, noninterest income declined only $9 million due to strength in both capital markets and mortgage. Capital markets-related income had another record quarter, increasing $52 million sequentially and exhibiting strong returns on the strategic investments we have made in this business over many years. In addition, as a reminder, we had $17 million [ph] in CVA-related charges last quarter, which suppressed the income. 
Mortgage production income increased $7 million from an already strong second quarter, benefiting from increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. As a reminder, we are now fully implementing our enhanced posting order process and expect to see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter starting now. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 6. Noninterest expense increased $64 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance-related costs, higher costs associated with increased revenue and business activity and increased net occupancy expenses. In terms of the specific expense categories, outside processing and software costs increased $23 million sequentially, primarily due to increased technology investments, higher regulatory-related costs, higher levels of business activity and normal quarterly variability. 
Net occupancy expense increased from the prior quarter due to a $6 million discrete benefit in the second quarter and a reduction in amortized gains from prior sale-leaseback transactions. Over time, these amortized gains will further dissipate. However, we will be able to offset most of this with a more efficient branch network, resulting in net occupancy costs that are generally stable from here on. Lastly, the improved levels of revenue and business activity resulted in increased incentive compensation and also partially impacted the growth in outside processing, as I noted earlier. 
In comparison to the third quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 11%, not only due to the same reasons as the sequential increase, but also due to roughly $30 million of discrete mortgage-related recoveries and roughly $30 million of lower incentive and benefit costs in the prior year. Overall, while a portion of the expense growth this quarter was related to revenue and a portion was anticipated increases, we do not view the absolute level of expenses we reported this quarter to be our new run rate, and we will continue to work diligently to improve our execution and effectiveness. 
On Slide 7, as we had discussed last quarter, the tangible efficiency ratio increased and was 62.5% for the third quarter. Year to date, the tangible efficiency ratio is 61.6%, 100 basis points better than the full year 2015, and we are well on track to meet our 2016 commitment. Going forward, we continue to remain focused on continuous improvement towards achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Moving on Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters, and we saw visible improvement in energy-related charge-offs, which drove the 4 basis point reduction in the total net charge-off ratio. Assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we still expect a remaining $40 million to $60 million of energy-related charge-offs over the coming 2 or 3 quarters. 
Nonperforming loans were flat from the prior quarter at 67 basis points as slightly lower energy NPLs were offset by modest increases in other categories. 
The ALLL ratio decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter as a result of continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. This improvement, combined with slower loan growth and a lower energy-related provision, resulted in total provision expense that declined $49 million compared to the second quarter. Given good progress so far, we are now able to tighten our expected range for the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 35 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect a relatively stable allowance ratio in the near to medium term, which should result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, although there will always be some level of quarterly variability. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased 1% from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in consumer banking as our lending strategies continued to produce growth through each of our major channels. In addition, we completed the $1 billion auto loan sale consistent with our strategic goals to optimize the balance sheet and increase velocity while also allowing us to continue to meet the financing needs of our auto dealer clients. Separately, we reclassified approximately $1 billion of loans from commercial real estate to commercial construction this quarter in accordance with the revised interpretation of regulatory classification requirements. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.9 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth in C&I, CRE, residential and consumer loans. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in NOW, DDA and money market accounts. More impressively, average client deposits are up a full 17% over the past 2 years, amongst the highest of our peers. This success reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more client deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and teammates in each of our 3 operating segments. 
Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a reflection of a slight mix shift towards wholesale banking versus consumer banking clients. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. We commenced our 2016 capital plan this quarter, which included an increase in our quarterly share buyback amount from $175 million to $240 million and an increase in our dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.26, the combination of which was a 23% increase in total capital return. Despite this increase in capital return and lower AOCI as a result of higher long-term rates in the quarter, we still grew tangible book value per share 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio. 
Separately, we have reviewed the Federal Reserve's notice of proposed rulemaking regarding capital and stress test rules. And while there are still details to be ironed out next year, we believe the new rules and comments are a positive development in tailoring regulations towards actual risk profile and complexity. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we expect to add approximately $1 billion of high-quality liquid securities in the fourth quarter to finalize our progress toward the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving on to the segment overviews, let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income increased $14 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue and lower credit costs, but was $21 million lower compared to the prior year as higher noninterest expense and provision expense offset a 3% increase in revenue. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 5% versus the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth. More specifically, our investments in direct consumer lending continued to yield positive results. Consumer loans are up 20% year-over-year as our product offerings and strong plan experience have driven continued market share gains. 
Noninterest income was up 6% sequentially as a result of discrete items in the current quarter and prior quarter in addition to seasonally higher trust and investment management fees. Retail investment income is down sequentially and year-over-year, as reduced transaction-related activity has been partially offset by growth in our retail brokerage managed money product, a strategic shift we've been working on for over a year now and one that will continue over the medium term. While this is negative for near-term retail investment income growth trends, it is positive for our clients and the long-term health of our business. 
Overall asset quality remained strong with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. The sequential decline in provision expense was primarily due to improvements in the home equity portfolio. 
Noninterest expense increased 4% sequentially and 8% compared to the prior year, generally driven by higher FDIC and regulatory costs, higher occupancy costs and other discrete costs and investments. 
We continue to see opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our Consumer Banking business as we make further investments in talent and technology while also realizing the benefits of a reduced physical real estate footprint. 
Moving on to Wholesale Banking on Slide 13, we had another strong quarter, in part due to strong market conditions, but more reflective of the continued strategic momentum we are having with our clients. Revenues were up 4% both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to capital markets record performance where we continue to see the results of our consistent focus on expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital market needs of all Wholesale Banking clients. More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter, another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic adviser. Additionally, capital markets income from non-CIB clients is up 34% year-to-date and we feel confident that this will become a more meaningful contributor to the bottom line as we work together as a team to become the preferred adviser to our commercial, CRE and Private Wealth clients. 
Net interest income was up 2% sequentially as a result of modest increases in loan spreads and continued deposit growth. Net income was up sequentially and down year-over-year, largely due to the variance in provision expense, which decreased sequentially as a result of the decline in energy net charge-offs, but increased on a year-over-year basis, also driven by energy. 
Overall, we believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and we'll capitalize on this positive momentum to deliver profitable growth. Additionally, with the acquisition of Pillar Financial, Wholesale's annual revenue should increase by roughly $90 million beginning in 2017. Pillar's efficiency ratio is roughly 80% to 85%, and while this will be dilutive to the overall efficiency ratio, the acquisition of Pillar will be accretive to our capabilities, ROA, ROE and net income. 
Moving to Mortgage on Slide 14. Mortgage was once again a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Revenue was up 1% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, driven by higher noninterest income. As you may remember last quarter, mortgage production income had a $10 million benefit from a product offering change, which altered the timing of revenue recognition. Despite this benefit in the second quarter, production income increased another $7 million sequentially as a result of higher volumes. Compared to the prior year, production income increased $60 million driven by higher volumes and higher gain on sale margins. Servicing income decreased sequentially as a result of anticipated increases in decay expense, but increased by $9 million compared to the prior year as a result of improved hedge performance and portfolio acquisitions. Our servicing UPB is up 2% year-over-year and we have purchased an additional $3 billion, which will transfer in the fourth quarter. 
Net income was down $12 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year. The sequential decrease was driven by higher noninterest expense while the year-over-year decrease was due to approximately $15 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2015. At a high level, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence and gaining smart market share has positively benefited both our clients and our shareholders. 
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to softening, albeit still good momentum in mortgage production volumes. While we don't expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate improvement relative to the fourth quarter of last year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill for some concluding remarks."

And to conclude, I'll point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieved 8% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and in each business segment. 
Second, while we had an increase in expenses this quarter, some of which was tied to revenue growth, the year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to 2015, and we remain absolutely steadfast in our commitment to achieving our long-term sub 60% efficiency ratio target. 
Third, the revenue growth we produced this quarter is a reflection of the consistent strategic investments we've been making in each of our businesses for now many years. As an example, this quarter was another record quarter for capital markets, an area where we've been making investments in talent, technology and resources for over 10 years. More recently, we've also been investing in corporate finance and industry specialists within commercial banking. These investments, combined with our heightened focus on working better together to meet the capital markets needs of all of our Wholesale banking clients continue to contribute to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's success. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology across both origination and servicing. Our origination market share has increased, and we continue to make servicing acquisitions. 
Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum evidenced by the 20% year-over-year increase in consumer loans. This growth has also resulted in a positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, helping to offset some of the margin compression in other areas. 
And fourth, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and make targeted acquisitions like Pillar Financial. Pillar is accretive to SunTrust's capabilities and our financial position and is also fully consistent with our purpose by helping finance critically needed affordable housing and senior housing for the communities we serve. 
So to conclude, I'm pleased with our company's performance in the third quarter, but as always, there are other [ph] things we can improve upon. Our strategic consistency has helped us improve execution and financial performance across the organization. Remaining focused on purpose of moving clients from financial stress to financial confidence will continue to be our guiding principle, and living this principle daily will result in improved financial wellbeing for our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course, our shareholders.

So it's fall in the Southeast, so I'm going to use a football analogy. So we didn't overspike the ball in the second quarter. And similarly, we're not conceding our ability to get in the end zone based on the third quarter, and the end zone being improved efficiency ratio for the year. There were things that were positive from the expense side, so obviously expense tied to revenue. There were things that were strategic investments from the technology side that we wanted to make sure that we continue to do to support our businesses. There were investments in people and other resources. And then there were things like -- there were some -- you saw the increase in operating losses, some small legal components as part of that. And those are consistent things, but if they're disappointing, yes, absolutely, they're disappointing. And I want to make sure that we continue to keep, and I'm confident we've got it, the stringent focus on achieving the overall efficiency ratio. Remember, it's not the expense target. I think the good news, I think the expense target so that what we talked about in the beginning of the year probably is going to go up a little bit, but the good news is it's going up for the right reasons. It's going up because we've got more revenue, we've got more capability. And the efficiency ratio target improvement this year over last year and improvement next year over this year is a consistent theme that we've done for 5 years and I don't plan on breaking it."

Well, let me take that one. So as Bill said, look, we're not happy about the expense level this quarter in and of itself and we are working on ways to bring that down, but I do want to take a step back and look at expenses overall in the context of the company. You recall at the beginning of this year, we thought that expenses could be around $5.4 billion for the year if we had good revenue growth and if we were able to also deliver some operating leverage. I think when you look now 9 months through the year, we can probably say that revenue growth is actually ahead of expectations, and thus, so our expenses, and you can see the improvement in the overall efficiency ratio for the year so far and we expect that to continue for this year. From an operating leverage perspective, our revenues this year are up, north of $400 million, and compared to expense growth of about $200 million. So we've delivered $200 million more PPNR and the business that's about 100 basis points more efficient overall. As I think about now Q4 and looking at next year, I don't think that we are going to consistently operate with an expense base that's north of $1.4 billion per quarter, although it is, to some extent, going to be revenue-dependent. If we continue to deliver revenue growth the way we have this year, obviously, our expense base is going to climb for comp, outside processing and other volume-related costs. We've also had some step-ups in expenses, things like the new FDIC assessment, and we continue to make investments in technology and talent to help grow revenue. But as I look to next year, we have delivered, I think, Matt, counting this year, 5 years of continued efficiency ratio improvements. We expect to be able to do that again next year. And we also very consistently said that it takes $1.00 of expense to generate $2 of revenue. That is -- that's going to be a trade we're willing to make. You can see we did that pretty well exactly in the 9 months this year relative to last year, right. We had $200 million more expenses and $400 million more revenue. So that -- we've done that, we're going to try to continue to grow revenue more than expenses and we're going to continue to try to make this company more efficient and look to bring our efficiency ratio down next year relative to this year."

So that volume inevitably is going to grind into NIM and bring margins down just a little bit.

And if we continue to get solid loan growth the way that we have been and expect -- we do expect that we'll be able to bring net interest income up somewhat.

I think the part that I mentioned also in my comments that we're starting to see, and I'm excited about for the future, is what we built in the commercial side really sort of to try to really replicate what we're doing in CIB and get that same advisory-type primary positioning in the commercial market anwe made a lot of investments there.

Think about overall Consumer Banking and Private Wealth, there's pluses and minuses in there. With the effect of the posting order, that will be a little bit of a negative. But as we continue to bring in more clients into our Private Wealth business and move them into an asset management model, there are very good long-term fees that I think are going to be generated as we help that set of clients mortgage overall. As you know, seasonally, Q2 and Q3 are the best seasons for mortgage. Q4 and Q1 are typically slower. So as we move into Q4, mortgage fees probably come off. But looking out over the course of the next year or 2, we've built a terrific mortgage business and we're gaining market share. And as we do that, I feel good about where our mortgage business is going over all. Within the Wholesale banking business, we have talked a fair bit of about the growth in capital markets, about our business model that brings big bank capabilities and expertise to our core commercial client base. And as we continue to work more with that client base, I think you're going to see fees in Wholesale banking grow as we gain market share there. So if I try to put whole of those things together over time, Jason, the net fees for us, even excluding Pillar, I think, are going up to be over time. Adding Pillar to that is only a positive. And as I said earlier about Pillar specifically, I think in 2017, we'll see about $90 million of fee revenue from Pillar."

And then you talked about in the fourth quarter adding $1 billion in liquid assets for finalizing your liquidity coverage ratio, which would also be punitive to your net interest margin while not as effective on your net interest income.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
We reported $0.91 of earnings this quarter, which represents a 2% increase relative to the core earnings of the prior quarter and prior year. Overall, I'd characterize this as a good quarter. Revenue growth in particular was very strong, up 8% compared to the prior year and reflects the ongoing investments we've made in each of our businesses over the past 2 years. Noninterest income was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in Mortgage and another record quarter in capital markets, which is clear that we are increasingly becoming a preferred strategic adviser to our clients. Net interest income was up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Our businesses remained focus on managing the balance sheet in a strategic profitable manner, which has allowed us to overcome much of the margin compression. The $1 billion auto loan sale we executed this quarter is fully consistent with our commitment to meet our clients' needs, while also optimizing the balance sheet by staying disciplined on returns. 
Overall, our strong revenue growth helped offset the increase in expenses and keeps us on track to meet our goal of improving the efficiency of the company, evidenced by the fact that our year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to all of 2015. 
Now with that said, absolute expenses this quarter came in higher than I feel is acceptable. Some of this was related to revenue and some were anticipated increases, but overall, we did not fully demonstrate the strong expense control I think we're capable of. 
Asset quality improved as we made further progress in working through certain energy credits. The net charge-off ratio declined to 35 basis points, nonperforming loans were stable and provision expense declined. I consider our overall asset quality to be strong, which is a testament of the solid economic conditions in our markets and businesses and our continued underwriting discipline. 
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.7% on a BASEL III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Additionally, we began executing our 2016 capital plan this quarter, of which we will return 23% more capital to our shareholders relative to the previous plan. 
In addition, I'll highlight the acquisition of Pillar Financial, which was announced yesterday. As you've heard us say in the past, the types of acquisitions we're focused on today are businesses that complement and leverage our existing capabilities while also being accretive to our return profile. Pillar Financial does just that. They're a multifamily agency lending and servicing company that holds Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA licenses, which they originate to distribute focus. This acquisition broadens the capabilities of our commercial real estate team, increases the velocity of our balance sheet and allows us to meet more of our clients' permanent financing needs. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to provide an update regarding our onUp movement, which is focused on sparking a conversation with all Americans about money and giving them the tools and resources they need to move from financial stress to financial confidence. We formally launched this movement with our Super Bowl ad back in February, but it truly is an extension of our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. I'm pleased to announce that over 700,000 people have joined the movement by taking a first step towards financial confidence. This is just one symbol of our commitment to put our purpose in action every day. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem."

Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued",2180,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment, which negatively impacted both residential mortgage loan and security yields. In addition, the full effect of last quarter's subordinated debt issuance, along with slightly higher deposit costs, also contributed to the sequential decline. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR and further favorable mix shift in our loan portfolio as a result of our continuous balance sheet optimization efforts. 
Net interest income increased $19 million from prior quarter as solid 1% average loan and deposit growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline 2 to 3 basis points next quarter. We are continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving on to Slide 5. You can see that despite the recognition of $44 million in net asset-related gains last quarter, noninterest income declined only $9 million due to strength in both capital markets and mortgage. Capital markets-related income had another record quarter, increasing $52 million sequentially and exhibiting strong returns on the strategic investments we have made in this business over many years. In addition, as a reminder, we had $17 million in CVA-related charges last quarter, which suppressed the income. Mortgage production income increased $7 million from an already strong second quarter, benefiting from increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. As a reminder, we are now fully implementing our enhanced posting order process and expect to see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter starting now. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 6. Noninterest expense increased $64 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance-related costs, higher costs associated with increased revenue and business activity and increased net occupancy expenses. In terms of the specific expense categories, outside processing and software costs increased $23 million sequentially, primarily due to increased technology investments, higher regulatory-related costs, higher levels of business activity and normal quarterly variability. 
Net occupancy expense increased from the prior quarter due to a $6 million discrete benefit in the second quarter and a reduction in amortized gains from prior sale-leaseback transactions. Over time, these amortized gains will further dissipate. However, we will be able to offset most of this with a more efficient branch network, resulting in net occupancy costs that are generally stable from here on. Lastly, the improved levels of revenue and business activity resulted in increased incentive compensation and also partially impacted the growth in outside processing, as I noted earlier. 
In comparison to the third quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 11%, not only due to the same reasons as the sequential increase, but also due to roughly $30 million of discrete mortgage-related recoveries and roughly $30 million of lower incentive and benefit costs in the prior year. 
Overall, while a portion of the expense growth this quarter was related to revenue and a portion was anticipated increases, we do not view the absolute level of expenses we reported this quarter to be our new run rate, and we will continue to work diligently to improve our execution and effectiveness. 
On Slide 7, as we had discussed last quarter, the tangible efficiency ratio increased and was 62.5% for the third quarter. Year to date, the tangible efficiency ratio is 61.6%, 100 basis points better than the full year 2015, and we are well on track to meet our 2016 commitment. Going forward, we continue to remain focused on continuous improvement towards achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Moving on Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters and we saw visible improvement in energy-related charge-offs, which drove the 4 basis point reduction in the total net charge-off ratio. Assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we still expect a remaining $40 million to $60 million of energy-related charge-offs over the coming 2 or 3 quarters. 
Nonperforming loans were flat from the prior quarter at 67 basis points as slightly lower energy NPLs were offset by modest increases in other categories. 
The ALLL ratio decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter as a result of continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. This improvement, combined with slower loan growth and a lower energy-related provision, resulted in total provision expense that declined $49 million compared to the second quarter. Given good progress so far, we are now able to tighten our expected range for the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 35 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect a relatively stable allowance ratio in the near to medium term, which should result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, although there will always be some level of quarterly variability. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased 1% from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in Consumer Banking as our lending strategies continued to produce growth through each of our major channels. In addition, we completed the $1 billion auto loan sale consistent with our strategic goals to optimize the balance sheet and increase velocity while also allowing us to continue to meet the financing needs of our auto dealer clients. Separately, we reclassified approximately $1 billion of loans from commercial real estate to commercial construction this quarter in accordance with the revised interpretation of regulatory classification requirements. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.9 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth in C&I, CRE, residential and consumer loans. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in NOW, DDA and money market accounts. More impressively, average client deposits are up a full 17% over the past 2 years, amongst the highest of our peers. This success reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more client deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and teammates in each of our 3 operating segments. 
Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a reflection of a slight mix shift towards wholesale banking versus consumer banking clients. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. We commenced our 2016 capital plan this quarter, which included an increase in our quarterly share buyback amount from $175 million to $240 million and an increase in our dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.26, the combination of which was a 23% increase in total capital return. 
Despite this increase in capital return and lower AOCI as a result of higher long-term rates in the quarter, we still grew tangible book value per share 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio. 
Separately, we have reviewed the Federal Reserve's notice of proposed rulemaking regarding capital and stress test rules, and while there are still details to be ironed out next year, we believe the new rules and comments are a positive development in tailoring regulations towards actual risk profile and complexity. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we expect to add approximately $1 billion of high-quality liquid securities in the fourth quarter to finalize our progress toward the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving on to the segment overviews, let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income increased $14 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue and lower credit costs, but was $21 million lower compared to the prior year as higher noninterest expense and provision expense offset a 3% increase in revenue. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 5% versus the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth. More specifically, our investments in direct consumer lending continued to yield positive results. Consumer loans are up 20% year-over-year as our product offerings and strong client experience have driven continued market share gains. Noninterest income was up 6% sequentially as a result of discrete items in the current quarter and prior quarter in addition to seasonally higher trust and investment management fees. Retail investment income was down sequentially and year-over-year as reduced transaction-related activity has been partially offset by growth in our retail brokerage managed money product, a strategic shift we've been working on for over a year now and one that will continue over the medium term. While this is negative for near-term retail investment income growth trends, it is positive for our clients and the long-term health of our business. 
Overall asset quality remained strong with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. The sequential decline in provision expense was primarily due to improvements in the home equity portfolio. 
Noninterest expense increased 4% sequentially and 8% compared to the prior year, generally driven by higher FDIC and regulatory costs, higher occupancy costs and other discrete costs and investments. 
We continue to see opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our Consumer Banking business as we make further investments in talent and technology while also realizing the benefits of a reduced physical real estate footprint. 
Moving on to Wholesale Banking on Slide 13, we had another strong quarter, in part due to strong market conditions, but more reflective of the continued strategic momentum we are having with our clients. Revenues were up 4% both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to capital markets record performance where we continue to see the results of our consistent focus on expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital market needs of all Wholesale Banking clients. More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter, another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic adviser. Additionally, capital markets income from non-CIB clients is up 34% year-to-date and we feel confident that this will become a more meaningful contributor to the bottom line as we work together as a team to become the preferred adviser to our commercial, CRE and Private Wealth clients. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially as a result of modest increases in loan spreads and continued deposit growth. Net income was up sequentially and down year-over-year, largely due to the variance in provision expense, which decreased sequentially as a result of the decline in energy net charge-offs, but increased on a year-over-year basis also driven by energy. 
Overall, we believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and we'll capitalize on this positive momentum to deliver profitable growth. Additionally, with the acquisition of Pillar Financial, Wholesale's annual revenue should increase by roughly $90 million beginning in 2017. Pillar's efficiency ratio is roughly 80% to 85%, and while this will be dilutive to the overall efficiency ratio, the acquisition of Pillar will be accretive to our capabilities, ROA, ROE and net income. 
Moving to Mortgage on Slide 14. Mortgage was once again a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Revenue was up 1% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, driven by higher noninterest income. As you may remember last quarter, mortgage production income had a $10 million benefit from a product offering change, which altered the timing of revenue recognition. Despite this benefit in the second quarter, production income increased another $7 million sequentially as a result of higher volumes. Compared to the prior year, production income increased $60 million driven by higher volumes and higher gain on sale margins. Servicing income decreased sequentially as a result of anticipated increases in decay expense, but increased by $9 million compared to the prior year as a result of improved hedge performance and portfolio acquisitions. Our servicing UPB is up 2% year-over-year and we have purchased an additional $3 billion, which will transfer in the fourth quarter. Net income was down $12 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year. The sequential decrease was driven by higher noninterest expense while the year-over-year decrease was due to approximately $15 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2015. 
At a high level, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence and gaining smart market share has positively benefited both our clients and our shareholders. 
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to softening, albeit still good momentum in mortgage production volumes. While we don't expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate improvement relative to the fourth quarter of last year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill for some concluding remarks."

And to conclude, I'll point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk",452,"Thanks, Aleem. And to conclude, I'll point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieved 8% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and in each business segment. 
Second, while we had an increase in expenses this quarter, some of which was tied to revenue growth, the year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to 2015, and we remain absolutely steadfast in our commitment to achieving our long-term sub-60% efficiency ratio target. 
Third, the revenue growth we produced this quarter is a reflection of the consistent strategic investments we've been making in each of our businesses for now many years. As an example, this quarter was another record quarter for capital markets, an area where we've been making investments in talent, technology and resources for over 10 years. More recently, we've also been investing in corporate finance and industry specialists within commercial banking. These investments, combined with our heightened focus on working better together to meet the capital markets needs of all of our Wholesale banking clients, continue to contribute to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's success. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology across both origination and servicing. Our origination market share has increased and we continue to make servicing acquisitions. 
Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum evidenced by the 20% year-over-year increase in consumer loans. This growth has also resulted in a positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, helping to offset some of the margin compression in other areas. 
And fourth, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and make targeted acquisitions like Pillar Financial. Pillar is accretive to SunTrust's capabilities and our financial position and is also fully consistent with our purpose by helping finance critically needed affordable housing and senior housing for the communities we serve. 
So to conclude, I'm pleased with our company's performance in the third quarter, but as always, there are other things we can improve upon. Our strategic consistency has helped us improve execution and financial performance across the organization. Remaining focused on purpose of moving clients from financial stress to financial confidence will continue to be our guiding principle, and living this principle daily will result in improved financial well-being for our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course, our shareholders.

So it's fall in the Southeast, so I'm going to use a football analogy. So we didn't over spike the ball in the second quarter. And similarly, we're not conceding our ability to get in the end zone based on the third quarter, and the end zone being improved efficiency ratio for the year. There were things that were positive from the expense side, so obviously expense tied to revenue. There were things that were strategic investments from the technology side that we wanted to make sure that we continue to do to support our businesses. There were investments in people and other resources. And then there were things like -- there were some -- you saw the increase in operating losses, some small legal components as part of that. And those are consistent things, but if they're disappointing, yes, absolutely, they're disappointing. And I want to make sure that we continue to keep, and I'm confident we've got it, the stringent focus on achieving the overall efficiency ratio. Remember, it's not the expense target. I think the good news, I think the expense target so that what we talked about in the beginning of the year probably is going to go up a little bit, but the good news is it's going up for the right reasons. It's going up because we've got more revenue, we've got more capability. And the efficiency ratio target improvement this year over last year and improvement next year over this year is a consistent theme that we've done for 5 years and I don't plan on breaking it."

Well, let me take that one. So as Bill said, look, we're not happy about the expense level this quarter in and of itself and we are working on ways to bring that down, but I do want to take a step back and look at expenses overall in the context of the company. You recall at the beginning of this year, we thought that expenses could be around $5.4 billion for the year if we had good revenue growth and if we were able to also deliver some operating leverage. I think when you look now 9 months through the year, we can probably say that revenue growth is actually ahead of expectations, and thus, so our expenses, and you can see the improvement in the overall efficiency ratio for the year so far and we expect that to continue for this year. From an operating leverage perspective, our revenues this year are up, north of $400 million, and compared to expense growth of about $200 million. So we've delivered $200 million more PPNR and the business that's about 100 basis points more efficient overall. As I think about now Q4 and looking at next year, I don't think that we are going to consistently operate with an expense base that's north of $1.4 billion per quarter, although it is, to some extent, going to be revenue-dependent. If we continue to deliver revenue growth the way we have this year, obviously, our expense base is going to climb for comp, outside processing and other volume-related costs. We've also had some step-ups in expenses, things like the new FDIC assessment, and we continue to make investments in technology and talent to help grow revenue. But as I look to next year, we have delivered, I think, Matt, counting this year, 5 years of continued efficiency ratio improvements. We expect to be able to do that again next year. And we also very consistently said that it takes $1.00 of expense to generate $2 of revenue. That is -- that's going to be a trade we're willing to make. You can see we did that pretty well exactly in the 9 months this year relative to last year, right. We had $200 million more expenses and $400 million more revenue. So that -- we've done that, we're going to try to continue to grow revenue more than expenses and we're going to continue to try to make this company more efficient and look to bring our efficiency ratio down next year relative to this year."

As it relates to C&I, there are some seasonal things, so for example, the dealer portfolio goes down a little bit in the third quarter, revolver utilization goes down a bit, we had some more paydowns. Our production in C&I is fine. The CRE production is down, which you would expect. And then if I look at sort of the pipeline, the pipeline looks -- in C&I looks good. So the pipeline looks okay.

But in terms of overall regulatory and compliance costs, if I look forward, John, I don't think in the short to medium term, I would think of regulatory costs, in general, abating or declining.

Mortgage, overall, as you know, seasonally, Q2 and Q3 are the best seasons for Mortgage. Q4 and Q1 are typically slower. So as we move into Q4, mortgage fees probably come off. But looking out over the course of the next year or 2, we've built a terrific Mortgage business and we're gaining market share. And as we do that, I feel good about where our Mortgage business is going overall. Within the Wholesale Banking business, we've already talked a fair bit of about the growth in capital markets, about our business model that brings big bank capabilities and expertise to our core commercial client base. And as we continue to work more with that client base, I think you're going to see fees in Wholesale Banking grow as we gain market share there. So if I try to put now all of those things together over time, Jason, the net fees for us, even excluding Pillar, I think, are going to be going up over time.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
We reported $0.91 of earnings this quarter, which represents a 2% increase relative to the core earnings of the prior quarter and prior year. Overall, I'd characterize this as a good quarter. Revenue growth in particular was very strong, up 8% compared to the prior year and reflects the ongoing investments we've made in each of our businesses over the past 2 years. Noninterest income was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in Mortgage and another record quarter in capital markets, which is clear that we are increasingly becoming a preferred strategic adviser to our clients. 
Net interest income was up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Our businesses remain focus on managing the balance sheet in a strategic, profitable manner, which has allowed us to overcome much of the margin compression. The $1 billion auto loan sale we executed this quarter is fully consistent with our commitment to meet our clients' needs, while also optimizing the balance sheet by staying disciplined on returns. 
Overall, our strong revenue growth helped offset the increase in expenses and keeps us on track to meet our goal of improving the efficiency of the company, evidenced by the fact that our year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to all of 2015. 
Now with that said, absolute expenses this quarter came in higher than I feel is acceptable. Some of this was related to revenue and some were anticipated increases, but overall, we did not fully demonstrate the strong expense control I think we're capable of. 
Asset quality improved as we made further progress in working through certain energy credits. The net charge-off ratio declined to 35 basis points, nonperforming loans were stable and provision expense declined. I consider our overall asset quality to be strong, which is a testament of the solid economic conditions in our markets and businesses and our continued underwriting discipline. 
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Additionally, we began executing our 2016 capital plan this quarter, of which we will return 23% more capital to our shareholders relative to the previous plan. 
In addition, I'll highlight the acquisition of Pillar Financial, which was announced yesterday. As you've heard us say in the past, the types of acquisitions we're focused on today are businesses that complement and leverage our existing capabilities while also being accretive to our return profile. Pillar Financial does just that. They're a multifamily agency lending and servicing company that holds Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA licenses, with an originate to distribute focus. This acquisition broadens the capabilities of our commercial real estate team, increases the velocity of our balance sheet and allows us to meet more of our clients' permanent financing needs. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to provide an update regarding our onUp movement, which is focused on sparking a conversation with all Americans about money and giving them the tools and resources they need to move from financial stress to financial confidence. We formally launched this movement with our Super Bowl ad back in February, but it truly is an extension of our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. I'm pleased to announce that over 700,000 people have joined the movement by taking a first step towards financial confidence. This is just one symbol of our commitment to put our purpose in action every day. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem."
305901,382898384,1058854,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued",2181,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment, which negatively impacted both residential mortgage loan and security yields. In addition, the full effect of last quarter's subordinated debt issuance, along with slightly higher deposit costs, also contributed to the sequential decline. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR and further favorable mix shift in our loan portfolio as a result of our continuous balance sheet optimization efforts. 
Net interest income increased $19 million from prior quarter as solid 1% average loan and deposit growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline 2 to 3 basis points next quarter. We are continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving on to Slide 5. You can see that despite the recognition of $44 million in net asset-related gains last quarter, noninterest income declined only $9 million due to strength in both capital markets and mortgage. Capital markets-related income had another record quarter, increasing $52 million sequentially and exhibiting strong returns on the strategic investments we have made in this business over many years. 
In addition, as a reminder, we had $17 million in CVA-related charges last quarter, which suppressed the income. Mortgage production income increased $7 million from an already strong second quarter, benefiting from increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. As a reminder, we are now fully implementing our enhanced posting order process and expect to see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter starting now. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 6. Noninterest expense increased $64 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance-related costs, higher costs associated with increased revenue and business activity and increased net occupancy expenses. In terms of the specific expense categories, outside processing and software costs increased $23 million sequentially, primarily due to increased technology investments, higher regulatory-related costs, higher levels of business activity and normal quarterly variability. 
Net occupancy expense increased from the prior quarter due to a $6 million discrete benefit in the second quarter and a reduction in amortized gains from prior sale-leaseback transactions. Over time, these amortized gains will further dissipate. However, we will be able to offset most of this with a more efficient branch network, resulting in net occupancy costs that are generally stable from here on. 
Lastly, the improved levels of revenue and business activity resulted in increased incentive compensation and also partially impacted the growth in outside processing, as I noted earlier. 
In comparison to the third quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 11%, not only due to the same reasons as the sequential increase, but also due to roughly $30 million of discrete mortgage-related recoveries and roughly $30 million of lower incentive and benefit costs in the prior year. 
Overall, while a portion of the expense growth this quarter was related to revenue and a portion was anticipated increases, we do not view the absolute level of expenses we reported this quarter to be our new run rate, and we will continue to work diligently to improve our execution and effectiveness. 
On Slide 7, as we had discussed last quarter, the tangible efficiency ratio increased and was 62.5% for the third quarter. Year to date, the tangible efficiency ratio is 61.6%, 100 basis points better than the full year 2015, and we are well on track to meet our 2016 commitment. Going forward, we continue to remain focused on continuous improvement towards achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters and we saw visible improvement in energy-related charge-offs, which drove the 4 basis point reduction in the total net charge-off ratio. Assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we still expect a remaining $40 million to $60 million of energy-related charge-offs over the coming 2 or 3 quarters. 
Nonperforming loans were flat from the prior quarter at 67 basis points as slightly lower energy NPLs were offset by modest increases in other categories. 
The ALLL ratio decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter as a result of continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. This improvement, combined with slower loan growth and a lower energy-related provision, resulted in total provision expense that declined $49 million compared to the second quarter. Given good progress so far, we are now able to tighten our expected range for the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 35 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect a relatively stable allowance ratio in the near to medium term, which should result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, although there will always be some level of quarterly variability. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased 1% from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in Consumer Banking as our lending strategies continue to produce growth through each of our major channels. In addition, we completed a $1 billion auto loan sale consistent with our strategic goals to optimize the balance sheet and increase velocity while also allowing us to continue to meet the financing needs of our auto dealer clients. Separately, we reclassified approximately $1 billion of loans from commercial real estate to commercial construction this quarter in accordance with a revised interpretation of regulatory classification requirements. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.9 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth in C&I, CRE, residential and consumer loans. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in NOW, DDA and money market accounts. More impressively, average client deposits are up a full 17% over the past 2 years, amongst the highest of our peers. This success reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and teammates in each of our 3 operating segments. 
Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a reflection of a slight mix shift towards wholesale banking versus consumer banking clients. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. We commenced our 2016 capital plan this quarter, which included an increase in our quarterly share buyback amount from $175 million to $240 million and an increase in our dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.26, the combination of which was a 23% increase in total capital return. 
Despite this increase in capital return and lower AOCI as a result of higher long-term rates in the quarter, we still grew tangible book value per share 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio. 
Separately, we have reviewed the Federal Reserve's notice of proposed rulemaking regarding capital and stress test rules, and while there are still details to be ironed out next year, we believe the new rules and comments are a positive development in tailoring regulations towards actual risk profile and complexity. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we expect to add approximately $1 billion of high-quality liquid securities in the fourth quarter to finalize our progress towards the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving on to the segment overviews, let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income increased $14 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue and lower credit costs, but was $21 million lower compared to the prior year as higher noninterest expense and provision expense offset a 3% increase in revenue. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 5% versus the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth. More specifically, our investments in direct consumer lending continue to yield positive results. 
Consumer loans are up 20% year-over-year as our product offerings and strong client experience have driven continued market share gains. Noninterest income was up 6% sequentially as a result of discrete items in the current quarter and prior quarter in addition to seasonally higher trust and investment management fees. Retail investment income is down sequentially and year-over-year as reduced transaction-related activity has been partially offset by growth in our retail brokerage managed money product, a strategic shift we've been working on for over a year now and one that will continue over the medium term. While this is negative for near-term retail investment income growth trends, it is positive for our clients and the long-term health of our business. 
Overall asset quality remains strong with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. The sequential decline in provision expense was primarily due to improvements in the home equity portfolio. 
Noninterest expense increased 4% sequentially and 8% compared to the prior year, generally driven by higher FDIC and regulatory costs, higher occupancy costs and other discrete costs and investments. 
We continue to see opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our Consumer Banking business as we make further investments in talent and technology while also realizing the benefits of a reduced physical real estate footprint. 
Moving on to Wholesale Banking on Slide 13. We had another strong quarter, in part due to strong market conditions, but more reflective of the continued strategic momentum we are having with our clients. Revenues were up 4% both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to capital markets' record performance where we continue to see the results of our consistent focus on expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital market needs of all Wholesale Banking clients. More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter, another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic adviser. 
Additionally, capital markets income from non-CIB clients is up 34% year-to-date and we feel confident that this will become a more meaningful contributor to the bottom line as we work together as a team to become the preferred adviser to our commercial, CRE and Private Wealth clients. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially as a result of modest increases in loan spreads and continued deposit growth. Net income was up sequentially and down year-over-year, largely due to the variance in provision expense, which decreased sequentially as a result of the decline in energy net charge-offs, but increased on a year-over-year basis also driven by energy. 
Overall, we believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and we'll capitalize on this positive momentum to deliver profitable growth. Additionally, with the acquisition of Pillar Financial, Wholesale's annual revenue should increase by roughly $90 million beginning in 2017. Pillar's efficiency ratio is roughly 80% to 85%, and while this will be dilutive to the overall efficiency ratio, the acquisition of Pillar will be accretive to our capabilities, ROA, ROE and net income. 
Moving to Mortgage on Slide 14. Mortgage was once again a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Revenue was up 1% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, driven by higher noninterest income. As you may remember last quarter, mortgage production income had a $10 million benefit from a product offering change, which altered the timing of revenue recognition. Despite this benefit in the second quarter, production income increased another $7 million sequentially as a result of higher volumes. Compared to the prior year, production income increased $60 million driven by higher volumes and higher gain on sale margins. Servicing income decreased sequentially as a result of anticipated increases in decay expense, but increased by $9 million compared to the prior year as a result of improved hedge performance and portfolio acquisitions. 
Our servicing UPB is up 2% year-over-year and we have purchased an additional $3 billion, which will transfer in the fourth quarter. Net income was down $12 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year. The sequential decrease was driven by higher noninterest expense while the year-over-year decrease was due to approximately $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2015. 
At a high level, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence and gaining smart market share has positively benefited both our clients and our shareholders. 
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to softening, albeit still good momentum in mortgage production volumes. While we don't expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate improvement relative to the fourth quarter of last year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill for some concluding remarks."

So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk",453,"Thanks, Aleem. And to conclude, I'll point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 8% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and in each business segment. 
Second, while we had an increase in expenses this quarter, some of which was tied to revenue growth, the year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to 2015, and we remain absolutely steadfast in our commitment to achieving our long-term sub-60% efficiency ratio target. 
Third, the revenue growth we produced this quarter is a reflection of the consistent strategic investments we've been making in each of our businesses for now many years. As an example, this quarter was another record quarter for capital markets, an area where we've been making investments in talent, technology and resources for over 10 years. More recently, we've also been investing in corporate finance and industry specialists within commercial banking. These investments, combined with our heightened focus on working better together to meet the capital markets needs of all of our Wholesale Banking clients, continue to contribute to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's success. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology across both origination and servicing. Our origination market share has increased and we continue to make servicing acquisitions. 
Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum evidenced by the 20% year-over-year increase in consumer loans. This growth has also resulted in a positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, helping to offset some of the margin compression in other areas. 
And fourth, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and make targeted acquisitions like Pillar Financial. Pillar is accretive to SunTrust's capabilities and our financial position and is also fully consistent with our purpose by helping finance critically needed affordable housing and senior housing for the communities we serve. 
So to conclude, I'm pleased with our company's performance in the third quarter, though as always, there are other things we can improve upon. Our strategic consistency has helped us improve execution and financial performance across the organization. Remaining focused on the purpose of moving clients from financial stress to financial confidence will continue to be our guiding principle, and living this principle daily will result in improved financial well-being for our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course our shareholders.

So it's fall in the Southeast, so I'm going to use a football analogy. So we didn't over-spike the ball in the second quarter. And similarly, we're not conceding our ability to get in the end zone based on the third quarter, and the end zone being improved efficiency ratio for the year. 
There were things that were positive from the expense side, so obviously expense tied to revenue. There were things that were strategic investments from the technology side that we wanted to make sure that we continue to do to support our businesses. There were investments in people and other resources. And then there were things like -- there were some -- you saw the increase in operating losses, some small legal components as part of that. And those are consistent things, but if they're disappointing, yes, absolutely they're disappointing. 
And I want to make sure that we continue to keep, and I'm confident we've got it, the stringent focus on achieving the overall efficiency ratio. Remember, it's not the expense target. I think the good news, I think the expense target, sort of what we talked about at the beginning of the year, probably is going to go up a little bit, but the good news is it's going up for the right reasons. It's going up because we've got more revenue, we've got more capability. And the efficiency ratio target improvement this year over last year and improvement next year over this year is a consistent theme that we've done for 5 years and I don't plan on breaking it."

But I do want to take a step back and look at expenses overall in the context of the company. You recall at the beginning of this year, we thought that expenses could be around $5.4 billion for the year if we had good revenue growth and if we were able to also deliver some operating leverage. 
I think when you look now 9 months through the year, we can probably say that revenue growth is actually ahead of expectations and thus so are expenses. And you can see the improvement in the overall efficiency ratio for the year so far, and we expect that to continue for this year. 
From an operating leverage perspective, our revenues this year are up, north of $400 million, and compared to expense growth of about $200 million. So we've delivered $200 million more PPNR and a business that's about 100 basis points more efficient overall. 
As I think about now Q4 and looking at next year, I don't think that we are going to consistently operate with an expense base that's north of $1.4 billion per quarter, although it is, to some extent, going to be revenue-dependent. If we continue to deliver revenue growth the way we have this year, obviously our expense base is going to climb for comp, outside processing and other volume-related costs. 
We've also had some step-ups in expenses, things like the new FDIC assessment, and we continue to make investments in technology and talent to help grow revenue. But as I look to next year, we have delivered, I think, Matt, counting this year, 5 years of continued efficiency ratio improvements. We expect to be able to do that again next year. And we've also very consistently said that if it takes $1.00 of expense to generate $2 of revenue that is -- that's going to be a trade we're willing to make. You can see we did that pretty well exactly in the 9 months this year relative to last year, right. We had $200 million more expenses and $400 million more revenue. So that -- we've done that. We're going to try to continue to grow revenue more than expenses, and we're going to continue to try to make this company more efficient and look to bring our efficiency ratio down next year relative to this year."

So that volume inevitably is going to grind into NIM and bring margins down just a little bit. 
But I think in the context of net interest income, if you look at the last several years, we've been able to, despite the decline in NIM, continue to bring net interest income generally up. And if we continue to get solid loan growth the way that we have been and expect, we do expect that we'll be able to bring net interest income up somewhat. I think net interest income can go -- it'll be modest, perhaps, relative to where we were this quarter, but I do expect net interest income to climb despite the slight decline in NIMs."

Mortgage overall, as you know, seasonally Q2 and Q3 are the best seasons for Mortgage. Q4 and Q1 are typically slower. So as we move into Q4, mortgage fees probably come off. But looking out over the course of the next year or 2, we've built a terrific Mortgage business and we're gaining market share.

Within the Wholesale Banking business, we've already talked a fair bit about the growth in capital markets, about our business model that brings big bank capabilities and expertise to our core commercial client base.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis. 
We reported $0.91 of earnings this quarter, which represents a 2% increase relative to the core earnings of the prior quarter and prior year. Overall, I'd characterize this as a good quarter. Revenue growth in particular was very strong, up 8% compared to the prior year and reflects the ongoing investments we've made in each of our businesses over the past 2 years. Noninterest income was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in Mortgage and another record quarter in capital markets, which is clear that we are increasingly becoming a preferred strategic adviser to our clients. 
Net interest income was up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Our businesses remain focus on managing the balance sheet in a strategic, profitable manner, which has allowed us to overcome much of the margin compression. The $1 billion auto loan sale we executed this quarter is fully consistent with our commitment to meet our clients' needs, while also optimizing the balance sheet by staying disciplined on returns. 
Overall, our strong revenue growth helped offset the increase in expenses and keeps us on track to meet our goal of improving the efficiency of the company, evidenced by the fact that our year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to all of 2015. 
Now with that said, absolute expenses this quarter came in higher than I feel is acceptable. Some of this was related to revenue and some were anticipated increases, but overall, we did not fully demonstrate the strong expense control I think we're capable of. 
Asset quality improved as we made further progress in working through certain energy credits. The net charge-off ratio declined to 35 basis points, nonperforming loans were stable and provision expense declined. I consider our overall asset quality to be strong, which is a testament of the solid economic conditions in our markets and businesses and our continued underwriting discipline. 
Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Additionally, we began executing our 2016 capital plan this quarter, of which we will return 23% more capital to our shareholders relative to the previous plan. 
In addition, I'll highlight the acquisition of Pillar Financial, which was announced yesterday. As you've heard us say in the past, the types of acquisitions we're focused on today are businesses that complement and leverage our existing capabilities while also being accretive to our return profile. Pillar Financial does just that. They're a multifamily agency lending and servicing company that holds Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA licenses, with an originate to distribute focus. This acquisition broadens the capabilities of our commercial real estate team, increases the velocity of our balance sheet and allows us to meet more of our clients' permanent financing needs. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to provide an update regarding our onUp movement, which is focused on sparking a conversation with all Americans about money and giving them the tools and resources they need to move from financial stress to financial confidence. We formally launched this movement with our Super Bowl ad back in February, but it truly is an extension of our company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. I'm pleased to announce that over 700,000 people have joined the movement by taking a first step towards financial confidence. This is just one symbol of our commitment to put our purpose in action every day. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem."
305901,382898384,1059061,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued",2181,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to Slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment, which negatively impacted both residential mortgage loan and security yields. In addition, the full effect of last quarter's subordinated debt issuance, along with slightly higher deposit costs, also contributed to the sequential decline. These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR and further favorable mix shift in our loan portfolio as a result of our continuous balance sheet optimization efforts. 
Net interest income increased $19 million from prior quarter as solid 1% average loan and deposit growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline 2 to 3 basis points next quarter. We are continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. 
Moving on to Slide 5. You can see that despite the recognition of $44 million in net asset-related gains last quarter, noninterest income declined only $9 million due to strength in both capital markets and mortgage. Capital markets-related income had another record quarter, increasing $52 million sequentially and exhibiting strong returns on the strategic investments we have made in this business over many years. 
In addition, as a reminder, we had $17 million in CVA-related charges last quarter, which suppressed the income. Mortgage production income increased $7 million from an already strong second quarter, benefiting from increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. As a reminder, we are now fully implementing our enhanced posting order process and expect to see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter starting now. 
Moving on to expenses on Slide 6. Noninterest expense increased $64 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance-related costs, higher costs associated with increased revenue and business activity and increased net occupancy expenses. In terms of the specific expense categories, outside processing and software costs increased $23 million sequentially, primarily due to increased technology investments, higher regulatory-related costs, higher levels of business activity and normal quarterly variability. 
Net occupancy expense increased from the prior quarter due to a $6 million discrete benefit in the second quarter and a reduction in amortized gains from prior sale-leaseback transactions. Over time, these amortized gains will further dissipate. However, we will be able to offset most of this with a more efficient branch network, resulting in net occupancy costs that are generally stable from here on. 
Lastly, the improved levels of revenue and business activity resulted in increased incentive compensation and also partially impacted the growth in outside processing, as I noted earlier. 
In comparison to the third quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 11%, not only due to the same reasons as the sequential increase, but also due to roughly $30 million of discrete mortgage-related recoveries and roughly $30 million of lower incentive and benefit costs in the prior year. 
Overall, while a portion of the expense growth this quarter was related to revenue and a portion was anticipated increases, we do not view the absolute level of expenses we reported this quarter to be our new run rate, and we will continue to work diligently to improve our execution and effectiveness. 
On Slide 7, as we had discussed last quarter, the tangible efficiency ratio increased and was 62.5% for the third quarter. Year to date, the tangible efficiency ratio is 61.6%, 100 basis points better than the full year 2015, and we are well on track to meet our 2016 commitment. Going forward, we continue to remain focused on continuous improvement towards achieving our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters and we saw visible improvement in energy-related charge-offs, which drove the 4 basis point reduction in the total net charge-off ratio. Assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we still expect a remaining $40 million to $60 million of energy-related charge-offs over the coming 2 or 3 quarters. 
Nonperforming loans were flat from the prior quarter at 67 basis points as slightly lower energy NPLs were offset by modest increases in other categories. 
The ALLL ratio decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter as a result of continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. This improvement, combined with slower loan growth and a lower energy-related provision, resulted in total provision expense that declined $49 million compared to the second quarter. Given good progress so far, we are now able to tighten our expected range for the company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 35 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect a relatively stable allowance ratio in the near to medium term, which should result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, although there will always be some level of quarterly variability. 
Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased 1% from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in Consumer Banking as our lending strategies continue to produce growth through each of our major channels. In addition, we completed a $1 billion auto loan sale consistent with our strategic goals to optimize the balance sheet and increase velocity while also allowing us to continue to meet the financing needs of our auto dealer clients. Separately, we reclassified approximately $1 billion of loans from commercial real estate to commercial construction this quarter in accordance with a revised interpretation of regulatory classification requirements. 
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.9 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth in C&I, CRE, residential and consumer loans. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in NOW, DDA and money market accounts. More impressively, average client deposits are up a full 17% over the past 2 years, amongst the highest of our peers. This success reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and teammates in each of our 3 operating segments. 
Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a reflection of a slight mix shift towards wholesale banking versus consumer banking clients. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. 
Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. We commenced our 2016 capital plan this quarter, which included an increase in our quarterly share buyback amount from $175 million to $240 million and an increase in our dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.26, the combination of which was a 23% increase in total capital return. 
Despite this increase in capital return and lower AOCI as a result of higher long-term rates in the quarter, we still grew tangible book value per share 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio. 
Separately, we have reviewed the Federal Reserve's notice of proposed rulemaking regarding capital and stress test rules, and while there are still details to be ironed out next year, we believe the new rules and comments are a positive development in tailoring regulations towards actual risk profile and complexity. 
Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements, and we expect to add approximately $1 billion of high-quality liquid securities in the fourth quarter to finalize our progress towards the increased 2017 requirements. 
Moving on to the segment overviews, let's begin with Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management on Slide 12. Net income increased $14 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue and lower credit costs, but was $21 million lower compared to the prior year as higher noninterest expense and provision expense offset a 3% increase in revenue. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 5% versus the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth. More specifically, our investments in direct consumer lending continue to yield positive results. 
Consumer loans are up 20% year-over-year as our product offerings and strong client experience have driven continued market share gains. Noninterest income was up 6% sequentially as a result of discrete items in the current quarter and prior quarter in addition to seasonally higher trust and investment management fees. Retail investment income is down sequentially and year-over-year as reduced transaction-related activity has been partially offset by growth in our retail brokerage managed money product, a strategic shift we've been working on for over a year now and one that will continue over the medium term. While this is negative for near-term retail investment income growth trends, it is positive for our clients and the long-term health of our business. 
Overall asset quality remains strong with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. The sequential decline in provision expense was primarily due to improvements in the home equity portfolio. 
Noninterest expense increased 4% sequentially and 8% compared to the prior year, generally driven by higher FDIC and regulatory costs, higher occupancy costs and other discrete costs and investments. 
We continue to see opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our Consumer Banking business as we make further investments in talent and technology while also realizing the benefits of a reduced physical real estate footprint. 
Moving on to Wholesale Banking on Slide 13. We had another strong quarter, in part due to strong market conditions, but more reflective of the continued strategic momentum we are having with our clients. Revenues were up 4% both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to capital markets' record performance where we continue to see the results of our consistent focus on expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital market needs of all Wholesale Banking clients. More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter, another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic adviser. 
Additionally, capital markets income from non-CIB clients is up 34% year-to-date and we feel confident that this will become a more meaningful contributor to the bottom line as we work together as a team to become the preferred adviser to our commercial, CRE and Private Wealth clients. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially as a result of modest increases in loan spreads and continued deposit growth. Net income was up sequentially and down year-over-year, largely due to the variance in provision expense, which decreased sequentially as a result of the decline in energy net charge-offs, but increased on a year-over-year basis also driven by energy. 
Overall, we believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated and we'll capitalize on this positive momentum to deliver profitable growth. Additionally, with the acquisition of Pillar Financial, Wholesale's annual revenue should increase by roughly $90 million beginning in 2017. Pillar's efficiency ratio is roughly 80% to 85%, and while this will be dilutive to the overall efficiency ratio, the acquisition of Pillar will be accretive to our capabilities, ROA, ROE and net income. 
Moving to Mortgage on Slide 14. Mortgage was once again a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Revenue was up 1% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, driven by higher noninterest income. As you may remember last quarter, mortgage production income had a $10 million benefit from a product offering change, which altered the timing of revenue recognition. Despite this benefit in the second quarter, production income increased another $7 million sequentially as a result of higher volumes. Compared to the prior year, production income increased $60 million driven by higher volumes and higher gain on sale margins. Servicing income decreased sequentially as a result of anticipated increases in decay expense, but increased by $9 million compared to the prior year as a result of improved hedge performance and portfolio acquisitions. 
Our servicing UPB is up 2% year-over-year and we have purchased an additional $3 billion, which will transfer in the fourth quarter. Net income was down $12 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year. The sequential decrease was driven by higher noninterest expense while the year-over-year decrease was due to approximately $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2015. 
At a high level, our continued focus on originating high-quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence and gaining smart market share has positively benefited both our clients and our shareholders. 
Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to softening, albeit still good momentum in mortgage production volumes. While we don't expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate improvement relative to the fourth quarter of last year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill for some concluding remarks."

And to conclude, I'll point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk",453,"Thanks, Aleem. And to conclude, I'll point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. 
So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 8% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and in each business segment. 
Second, while we had an increase in expenses this quarter, some of which was tied to revenue growth, the year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to 2015, and we remain absolutely steadfast in our commitment to achieving our long-term sub-60% efficiency ratio target. 
Third, the revenue growth we produced this quarter is a reflection of the consistent strategic investments we've been making in each of our businesses for now many years. As an example, this quarter was another record quarter for capital markets, an area where we've been making investments in talent, technology and resources for over 10 years. More recently, we've also been investing in corporate finance and industry specialists within commercial banking. These investments, combined with our heightened focus on working better together to meet the capital markets needs of all of our Wholesale Banking clients, continue to contribute to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's success. 
In Mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology across both origination and servicing. Our origination market share has increased and we continue to make servicing acquisitions. 
Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating strong, consistent momentum evidenced by the 20% year-over-year increase in consumer loans. This growth has also resulted in a positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, helping to offset some of the margin compression in other areas. 
And fourth, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and make targeted acquisitions like Pillar Financial. Pillar is accretive to SunTrust's capabilities and our financial position and is also fully consistent with our purpose by helping finance critically needed affordable housing and senior housing for the communities we serve. 
So to conclude, I'm pleased with our company's performance in the third quarter, though as always, there are other things we can improve upon. Our strategic consistency has helped us improve execution and financial performance across the organization. Remaining focused on the purpose of moving clients from financial stress to financial confidence will continue to be our guiding principle, and living this principle daily will result in improved financial well-being for our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course our shareholders. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and begin the Q&A."

So it's fall in the Southeast, so I'm going to use a football analogy. So we didn't over-spike the ball in the second quarter. And similarly, we're not conceding our ability to get in the end zone based on the third quarter, and the end zone being improved efficiency ratio for the year. 
There were things that were positive from the expense side, so obviously expense tied to revenue. There were things that were strategic investments from the technology side that we wanted to make sure that we continue to do to support our businesses. There were investments in people and other resources. And then there were things like -- there were some -- you saw the increase in operating losses, some small legal components as part of that. And those are consistent things, but if they're disappointing, yes, absolutely they're disappointing. 
And I want to make sure that we continue to keep, and I'm confident we've got it, the stringent focus on achieving the overall efficiency ratio. Remember, it's not the expense target. I think the good news, I think the expense target, sort of what we talked about at the beginning of the year, probably is going to go up a little bit, but the good news is it's going up for the right reasons. It's going up because we've got more revenue, we've got more capability. And the efficiency ratio target improvement this year over last year and improvement next year over this year is a consistent theme that we've done for 5 years and I don't plan on breaking it."

So as Bill said, look, we're not happy about the expense level this quarter in and of itself and we are working on ways to bring that down.

So as Bill said, look, we're not happy about the expense level this quarter in and of itself and we are working on ways to bring that down. But I do want to take a step back and look at expenses overall in the context of the company. You recall at the beginning of this year, we thought that expenses could be around $5.4 billion for the year if we had good revenue growth and if we were able to also deliver some operating leverage. 
I think when you look now 9 months through the year, we can probably say that revenue growth is actually ahead of expectations and thus so are expenses. And you can see the improvement in the overall efficiency ratio for the year so far, and we expect that to continue for this year. 
From an operating leverage perspective, our revenues this year are up, north of $400 million, and compared to expense growth of about $200 million. So we've delivered $200 million more PPNR and a business that's about 100 basis points more efficient overall. 
As I think about now Q4 and looking at next year, I don't think that we are going to consistently operate with an expense base that's north of $1.4 billion per quarter, although it is, to some extent, going to be revenue-dependent. If we continue to deliver revenue growth the way we have this year, obviously our expense base is going to climb for comp, outside processing and other volume-related costs. 
We've also had some step-ups in expenses, things like the new FDIC assessment, and we continue to make investments in technology and talent to help grow revenue. But as I look to next year, we have delivered, I think, Matt, counting this year, 5 years of continued efficiency ratio improvements. We expect to be able to do that again next year. And we've also very consistently said that if it takes $1.00 of expense to generate $2 of revenue that is -- that's going to be a trade we're willing to make. You can see we did that pretty well exactly in the 9 months this year relative to last year, right. We had $200 million more expenses and $400 million more revenue. So that -- we've done that. We're going to try to continue to grow revenue more than expenses, and we're going to continue to try to make this company more efficient and look to bring our efficiency ratio down next year relative to this year."

So that volume inevitably is going to grind into NIM and bring margins down just a little bit. 
But I think in the context of net interest income, if you look at the last several years, we've been able to, despite the decline in NIM, continue to bring net interest income generally up. And if we continue to get solid loan growth the way that we have been and expect, we do expect that we'll be able to bring net interest income up somewhat. I think net interest income can go -- it'll be modest, perhaps, relative to where we were this quarter, but I do expect net interest income to climb despite the slight decline in NIMs."

I think the part that I mentioned also in my comments that we're starting to see and I'm excited about for the future, is what we've built in the commercial side really sort of to try to really replicate what we're doing in CIB and get that same advisory type primary positioning in the commercial market.

We don't actually quantify our regulatory and compliance costs in and of themselves because they sit on so many different line items and are part of our total company. If you think about investments in technology, if we need to add a module onto a system to make sure that it's completely regulatory compliant, that -- the cost of investing in that module we don't show as regulatory or compliance costs specifically and call that out. So that's kind of a nonanswer to your second question. 
But in terms of overall regulatory and compliance costs, if I look forward, John, I don't think in the short to medium term I would think of regulatory costs, in general, abating or declining. I think we're in an environment where we would expect regulatory and compliance costs to be generally stable or increasing over time. And just the environment that we're in, I don't see realistically that anybody in the industry is going to see regulatory and compliance costs fall off."

As Aleem talked about, we have a sale-leaseback opportunity within our portfolio. I think you know that our markets are such that they're concentrated. Our branches are generally concentrated in urban centers, so that gives us -- affords us a lot more opportunity, I think, to optimize. We've got the combination of in-store and traditional banking centers, which also gives us an opportunity to optimize. So we feel that the branches will continue to go down. The investments in digital will offset that. And I would think, as Aleem alluded to, occupancy expense will sort of level out because some of those increases will be offset by the efficiencies that we're going to achieve."

But think about overall Consumer Banking and Private Wealth, there's pluses and minuses in there. With the effect of the posting order, that'll be a little bit of a negative. But as we continue to bring in more clients into our Private Wealth business and move them into an asset management model, there are very good long-term fees that I think are going to be generated as we help that set of clients. 
Mortgage overall, as you know, seasonally Q2 and Q3 are the best seasons for Mortgage. Q4 and Q1 are typically slower. So as we move into Q4, mortgage fees probably come off. But looking out over the course of the next year or 2, we've built a terrific Mortgage business and we're gaining market share. And as we do that, I feel good about where our Mortgage business is going overall. 
Within the Wholesale Banking business, we've already talked a fair bit about the growth in capital markets, about our business model that brings big bank capabilities and expertise to our core commercial client base. And as we continue to work more with that client base, I think you're going to see fees in Wholesale Banking grow as we gain market share there. 
So if I try to put all of those things together over time, Jason, net fees for us, even excluding Pillar, I think are going to be going up over time. Adding Pillar to that is only a positive. And as I said earlier about Pillar specifically, I think in 2017 we'll see about $90 million of fee revenue from Pillar."
