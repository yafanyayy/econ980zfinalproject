Welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the market opened this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The group reported another solid",1366,"Okay. Thank you. Welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the market opened this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
The group reported another solid quarter with consolidated gross bookings of approximately $12 billion, up about 24% on a constant-currency basis or 13% [ph] year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 99 million room nights in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year. 
Gross profit was up 12% or about 23% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 11% at $790 million. And finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $12.63 [ph], surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.81 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Now I'd like to take a moment and reflect back on our full-year results. Our customers made reservations for over $432 million room nights on Priceline Group platforms in 2015, over twice as many as our next biggest competitor. Despite the law of large numbers, we are organically grew this business up 25%, down only 3 percentage points from 2014's growth rate, and exited the year growing more quickly than we were growing when we entered it. The business was very profitable, generating $3.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 42.6% non-GAAP operating profit margin.
I believe that the solid performance in 2015 and many consecutive years and strong growth and profitability have been made possible by competitive advantages we have developed through the skill and hard work of our people around the world. 
Our capabilities in skill and partner acquisition, customer experience and efficient demand generation, plus our large installed base of accommodations and loyal travelers, give The Priceline Group a competitive mode that is deep and wide.
Let me expand on this point a bit. Being a leader in online travel and building an experienced marketplace isn't achieved by simply electronically connecting demand with supply. It may be a surprise to some, but about 2/3 of our employees are working on either the supply or customer service organizations. Only KAYAK, our 1 media asset, does not have a similar model. Our employees work at of 239 support offices in 173 cities around the world, working daily with partners and customers to deliver the absolute best booking experience wherever our customer comes from and wherever they're going.
On the supply side, we added over 200,000 properties during the year on Booking.com, covering everything from igloos to shared space, while maintaining stable take rates and a fee free model to the customer. Booking.com now has over 850 hotels -- 850,000 hotels, homes and other places to stay in over 220 countries and territories across the globe, up 34% from last year. The hard work of making this a daily really is achieved by thousands of dedicated and addicted energetic people around the world, having these properties and then working with our partners on an ongoing basis to ensure that our customers have the most choices of place to stay at the best prices available.
We offer by, far the most directly bookable lodging choices to our customers with over 22.6 million rooms potentially available on our websites, including 6.9 million rooms in vacation rentals and other non-hotel properties. With our worldwide team and market leading profitability, we are expanding this low-friction model more aggressively into the single owner, single room market as it continuous to mature. We strongly believe that this fee free experienced-centric model which makes booking homes and apartments as easy and trustworthy as booking a hotel, will be the winning model long-term.
On the customer experience side, the complexity of providing a world-class digital experience for customers becomes more daunting each year with various browsers and operating systems offered on desktop and mobile devices. On top of that, you have new platforms and capabilities being built every day. And for each of these, we need to make an intelligent decision about where and how to participate. The good news is the tools are becoming better, and customers continue to want to live more of their lives digitally. We have over 2,500 talented developers and other technology professionals working across our brands to offer our customers the best online booking experience on our desktop and mobile websites and app, optimize through hundreds of thousands of experiments.
We believe Booking.com has the highest converting online accommodation reservation path in the world, achieved through a deeply ingrained culture of innovation that results in experimentation at a transitional data scale and velocities that few companies can match. 
Our content this best-in-class with high resolution photos, detailed property descriptions, and 77 million plus verified and a fresh reviews for properties, in even the most far-flung destinations. We have thousands of customer service professionals stationed all over the world, helping our customers in 42 languages, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  We think our approach adds up to a great experience for our customers, which helps us to continue to grow the direct share of our business with outstanding everyday pricing and repeat traffic versus the alternative, which is to buy the business with coupons or discounting transaction by transaction. 
Booking.com surpassed 100 million customer accounts during 2015, and had our 1 billion guests stayed at one of our partners, approximately 300 million of those in 2015 alone, another testament to our success at earning long-term loyalty.
We invested $3 billion in marketing during 2015 to build our brands around the world and bring new customers to our website at profitable ROIs. Our historical competitive strengths from the desktop have translated very well to mobile. Our talented team used proprietary quantitative tools to manage bidding on hundreds of millions of multilingual keywords across desktop and mobile platforms, successfully balancing ROI discipline with strong growth. We continue to command a leading share of the demand channels we participate in, profitably converting shoppers into buyers, and buyers into loyal long-term customers.
Every year is an investment year of The Priceline Group. While every year is also an opportunity to deliver outstanding bottom line results. We evaluate every opportunity with our long term lens, requiring that they deliver value for our brand franchise is still tomorrow, beyond just delivering transactions today. 2016 will be no different, as we invest in exciting new opportunities like OpenTable's international expansion, our BookingSuite cloud software offers, our Booking.com for Business, while maintaining superior operating margins that will allow us to win in the face of heated competition.
And you could be confident that we're not standing still. The Priceline Group will continue to work hard to stay a step ahead of the competition with our unique combination of institutional know-how, culture systems and focused passion. We don't take any competitor lightly, and we compete ferociously every day, continuously seeking a higher executional gear in every facet of our business.
Booking.com, of course, makes up the majority of our business. However, as the group also has a portfolio of valuable income commentary brands, each of which makes money and has the aspiration to grow and build vertical mastery in their respective area of focus. We have new leadership of priceline.com and OpenTable, and both businesses are responding with a renewed energy and a strong commitment to profitable growth.
Agoda and rentalcars.com both continued to improve and differentiate their respective products, and both look to drive more business direct and through improved mobile experiences. 
And finally, KAYAK is an outstanding business and that is being smartly run and continues to contribute to the group beyond our new initial expectation.
I give these other brand teams a lot of independence and this is in general performance culture. Through our portfolio of brands, we aspire to achieve the group's mission to help people experience the world and become a global marketplace for experiences. I thank my colleagues around the world for delivering another great year. Their skill and dedication has up to build a great business, with strong competitive advantages that have been responsible for our past success and will help us continue to succeed in the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan?"

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q4 was a strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with accelerating room night growth and the second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin performance.  Growth was strong across all channels and geographic regions which we believe, indicates a generally healthy macro travel environment. 
Our global room night growth rate declined by more than 10 percentage points for a 2- to 3-week period after the terrorist attack in Paris, compared to what it had been before the attack. Growth bounced back strongly in December, and this momentum has carried over in Q1, as I will discuss further when I get to guidance.
Room nights booked grew by 27% in the fourth quarter, accelerating compared to the 22% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 11% in Q4 compared to Q3 growth of 13%. 
Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q4 2015 were up in a constant-currency basis by 1% for the consolidated group. Foreign exchange rates again presented a significant headwind into our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar and to our business mix, which skews heavily internationally.
Our Q4 gross bookings grew by about 24% on a constant-currency basis, but by only about 13% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant-currency basis and by 16% expressed in U.S. dollars.
Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 8%. We believe the U.S. performance was impacted by TV advertising decreases in the second half of 2015 as the priceline.com team transitioned their new brand campaign which recently launched in Q1. In addition, global airfares were down by about 15% over the last several months according to KAYAK Flight Search data, which significantly impacts priceline.com's gross bookings growth but has no impact on gross profit growth.
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $1.9 billion, and grew by about 23% on a constant-currency basis, and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our gross profit take rates remain stable as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been and should continue to be sustainable due to our position as a relatively low-cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our partners.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.6 billion, which grew by about 25% on a constant-currency basis, and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $268 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable revenues, grew by 17% in Q4 compared to the prior year.
Operating margins exceeded our guidance and were similar to Q4 last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.3% of gross profit for Q4 compared to 41.4% in Q4 last year. Online ad ROIs were better than our forecast but online advertising deleverage compared to the prior year due to the acceleration in gross bookings late in the quarter which will benefit revenue in Q1 and beyond when checkouts occur, as well as the impact of the terrorist attack on cancellations.
Off-line advertising came in slightly favorable to our forecast and is down year-over-year due to a shipment spent from off-line to online advertising for KAYAK, reduced advertising at priceline.com, as I mentioned a moment ago; and the impact of foreign exchange rates on Booking.com's off-line advertising expense, which grew by 18% in euros.
Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and only generated 11 bps of margin pressure compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $790 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $760 million and grew by 11% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Non-GAAP net income increased by 11%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 16%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $881 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2015, which is about 17% above last year, and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. 
For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion, and spent $174 million on CapEx, which means about 34% of our gross profit converted into free cash flow. We used our cash during the year to repurchase 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 billion. Darren just spoke about some of our operational competitive advantages. I believe that our market-leading profit margins, free cash flow, impeccable balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit rating, collectively constitute a competitive advantage because the significant financial flexibility to invest in our business to drive growth and positions us favorably versus our competitors.
Our board recently gave us a new authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute this program consistent with the pattern we've established over the last couple of years to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense based on the price of which our stock is trading and potential others -- uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2015, with about $800 million of that balance in the U.S.
Now for Q1 guidance. Our quarter is off to a strong start, as I mentioned a moment ago. Some of the strength in December, and thus far in Q1, is likely attributable to Chinese New Year, Carnival and eastern happening earlier this year. Leap year also helps our forecast slightly relative to last year by adding an extra day to the quarter. Although we were very about macro weakness evident in slowing economic growth, dropping oil prices and stock market volatility, the macro travel environment appears healthy to us. 
Lower oil prices have contributed to the significantly lower airline ticket prices, and consumers with more discretionary funds that are available for travel. And lastly and most importantly, a combination of a strong core execution and the benefits of the number of growth investments we have been making, are helping to drive the group's success. And I sincerely thank my colleagues around the world for their efforts.
Our growth continues to be strong across all channels and regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, maybe due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We are pleased with the brand marketing we get through TripAdvisor's Instant Book ad placement, but given the relative size of our business and our experienced so far, we don't expect that Instant Book will significantly impact our top line growth or ad efficiency.
Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.44 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 2% for the euro, and about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
Many other currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar than they were in Q1 last year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1. 
As you can see in our guidance, the Q1 impact of currency fluctuations on our dollar reported figures while still meaningful, is less severe than what we experienced during 2015. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, the year-over-year currency comps will become even less challenging after Q1. As I mentioned when we reported last quarter, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished out through the relative size of our priceline.com business to our consolidated results, and because our other 2 U.S. brands, KAYAK and OpenTable, do not have gross travel bookings. The metric also excludes the U.S. inbound, outbound and domestic business for Booking.com.
We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business as we have in the past to give insight into its performance. We were also adding guidance for consolidated room night growth to give visibility for this important metric. 
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting book to room nights to grow by 20% to 27% and total gross bookings to grow by 18% to 25% on a constant-currency basis, and by 12% to 19% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 16%. We expect gross profit to grow by 20% to 27% on a constant-currency basis, and by 14% to 21% in U.S. dollars.
We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency. 
Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $580 million and $620 million, which at the midpoint, is an increase of 13% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9 to $9.60 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 15% versus prior year. 
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 50.5 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015. 
We forecast GAAP EPS between $6.90 and $7.50 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges did not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first [ph] quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market, in particular.
We will now take your questions."

We knew at the time we acquired it, that we've made how to make some changes in leadership. Chris has done an awesome job. The team hit all of its Q4 KPIs, and these are all about have got -- how do we get medium- to long-term momentum. We are currently a prime and the United States but we also have operations in Japan, the U.K, Germany. And we've made an acquisition with AES digital to put us into Australia. There are also, by the way, a number of restaurants that use OpenTable software all around the world, although, may not have a consumer's facing site. The whole presence of globalizing OpenTable have been -- you see recently their latest app update allows Americans to book in London. You think that was the simplest thing that should've been done years ago, but there you go, it's done now. And this allows to become global. There's more things around languages as well. So if you go to book a restaurant in Germany, and you're from the United States, you will be able to see the menu in the product in English. And that's the kind of product that is going on platform and gets we expect that work to be done in this year than we have some amazing tools to be able to offer both the software proposition to restaurants as well as the demand proposition. But you'll see on Booking.com, for instance, if you search New York, you've got a beautifully little ad there, that says hey, book a restaurant in New York for OpenTable. Those things we found to be positive to the experiments. So that's where we are. I'm optimistic. I think ultimately, there is a traveler network effect. Our restaurants are a more local business than, say, hotel thong, of course. But on the other hand, transient travelers are extremely valuable to restaurants. I mean, filling those last few tables can also be the difference between making money and not making money. And they realize that those travelers have choice and they're relatively not near as informed as maybe local people and we think that's invaluable business. And we are seeing good results so far, but there's still a lot more work to do."

And we talked about the 22.6 million rooms we have on our website. In Europe, we're actually still adding a lot of properties. But because this is our most mature market, those properties are becoming smaller and smaller. By the way, they're still tremendously valuable, because all of these of smaller properties adds tremendous diversity to our accommodation base. Therefore, they're being able to fit very specific needs. They also help us and low availability times. So if there's a conference or something, these properties can help fill demand when you're in a supply constrained environment. So Europe is -- a lot of properties that are getting smaller and smaller. And that's the nature of the European business. And frankly, in Italy, at a time, we're at adding 100 properties a day. Because these are very small properties in small places, kind of mom-and-pop operated type of product. In other parts of the world, we're still adding many large multiroom. I think India, China, in particular. China, we've gone -- enter the year with about 6,500 properties, exited the year with 35,000 properties. A lot of that was organically built. In China, they have a lot more to do in just adding really large hotels and properties. The challenge in China is making sure you have enough domestic demand to fill those. Inbound China is not a huge market, but domestic China is a huge market. And we're filling those beds there were no ships within China, including our relationship with Ctrip.

I'd say, another part of a world that -- Africa, Central America, these are the areas we're still adding hotels. But at some point, we will have a most of the world's hotels and then there's still a lot of extra property count in these single-owner, single apartment type product, almost endless to some degree, it seems. But we're having to add those -- our room/property at a time, and that's obviously important and tough work."

There's -- one is the absolute level of the currency of the other issue is volatility. And the lower euro has a big impact but it's also the movement of the euro because people need to get used to the fact that the euro is now $1.11 and no longer $1.35. So we certainly see no that the euro is stabilized and that's had a positive impact on a year-over-year base of European starting to travel back to America, started to travel to the U.K, starting to travel to higher currency zones. I think the other point that Dan made, the KAYAK date of the lights are down 15% year-over-year, that actually listen to the travel budget as well. So we're seeing more positive flows for -- of Europeans into these higher currency markets and certainly, hasn't certainly recovered to the time $1.35 a euro, but it's more positive than it was a year ago. That said, intra EU travel is still -- we're seeing very positive impacts there. There were -- there's a number of crises in the world -- Tunisia, Egypt, even Turkey. The positive there for us is that many of youths markets are wholesale kind of package travel markets. We have properties there but they're traditionally sort of the Thomas Cooks, the TUIs of the world and a lot of that travel is no ending up in Nativity in Spain and southern France and that's moreover, retail market that place also to our strength, and that's another trend that we've been seeing recently."

Off-line advertising, we're going to heavy up in periods where we think we've got good creative, and it's moving video for us. But over the long term, we expect that we would have leverage there, too. It -- will it be a level in a market in both -- and hit the number of markets that we think we should be in, and then our business should continue to grow faster than our spend would. So then the biggest expense is also the biggest barrier, along that -- the online advertising. We are very pleased with what we've seen with the efficiency over the last couple of quarters, but we've had 3 years before that of seeing pressure on that metric and pressure on ROIs year-over-year. So it's difficult to predict what will happen there for the future, I have great confidence that we are probably better positioned than anybody else in the market with the most choices to try and convert that paid traffic into a booking on the best websites, the best converting websites from a desktop and mobile perspective, with the most clever advertising teams really tailoring our bidding approach and using best-in-class tools to make sure that we spend our money efficiently. So I like our competitive ham there. But I think that it's very difficult to predict exactly how that's going to play out in the future.

So we are primarily the targeted lesion over time, we've seen more customers come in for business purposes, and that's when we started to make some changes to our site, where we can see positive conversion, and that seems to work. So now you can go on to our site, they might be traveling for leisure or business. If you pick business, we highlight things important to businesspeople, and they seem to like that. And we've also discovered that about 20% of our business is business bookings versus leisure bookings. And the is of course is that -- we really knows but maybe half of travels business -- it could be more or less than that, but that points to a pretty big opportunity if we serve that customer well. So then secondly, we built a very simple tool that allows the systems to book for businesspeople, it allows you to track budget, it allows a manager to track where other people are, perspective. And now we're also optimizing that tool. We are seeing that our business bookings are growing faster than our leisure bookings, which means they are taking share on the site that's what we want to see. But it's a process of optimization and investment. And obviously, if you just think of the sheer size of the numbers that are going from 20 to 50, for instance, that's a huge opportunity but we're approaching it and in a very typical Booking.com Priceline Group, which is many small steps, lots of optimization and we're fairly positive. I think it will be one of the things that continues to contribute. There's no massive revolutionary movement, but more and evolutionary optimization. And today, feeling great about the progress but a lot more to do. Your second question, China outbound, some of it is hard to pick through when -- because of Chinese New Year, which is such a big holiday, and you guys have seen the pictures on the Internet and the train stations of -- hundreds of thousands of people. It was another great Chinese New Year, but the real question is where the things swing out. We did see, let's say, a little bit of softness, with China softness is all relative, it's still a fast-growing market, but still a little bit of softness in outbound and kind of Q3, Q4, a strong Chinese New Year. And then we have to see from there, where it goes. Obviously, the situation in China and the headlines can also rattle travelers. We haven't seen any large material effect. And I also believe, if my long-term thesis around China certainly hasn't changed, they are the world's largest outbound travelers, and we are going to continue to try to take a bigger share of that business going forward."

Yes, as you point out, I mean, depending on where you call a chain, we -- about 10% to 15% of our business is combination of global and regional chains. And we're always in contract negotiations with the chains. In fact, our take rate is quite stable. With many chains, we never had last room availability. But over time, they've given us more availability, partly because of good business. We bring in a transient traveler, very few of our travelers to stay at the same hotel twice. And this is a valuable business because it's incremental. I think what you're seeing is discomfort with may be, with the world is changing but you should know our relationships are quite tight. There's also a difference between the chain and the owner of the hotel. I mean, the owner of the hotel wants more of this kind of business. And most of them want to lean into our model. For me, the average chain hotel only gets about 1/2 of the business that should be coming to us, partly because of all of these restrictions that are put on it. But many chain owners are also agitating to make sure they get their fair share because the business they're not getting is either going to another chain or it's going through an independent hotel. So yes, I don't appreciate some of the actions that they've taken at the same level at times, but our relationships on a day-to-day basis are actually quite constructive and cordial. And our chain business is actually quite healthy. They have great products. Our customers want the product. And most of our customers, when they come to Washington, D.C, for instance, they're not looking for the Hilton or the Marriott in Washington. They're looking for a great bed in Washington. And our ranking system presents to them, this is well priced. And if the product is not well priced, or it's not available, it's not going to convert and therefore, it won't be presented to the customer. That's basically the way it works and I'm always hopeful we can work through many of these issues when they arise."

Our model -- part of the reason we get to our model is we default to it. That's the way our entire business works. And -- but if you look at our take rate in vacation rentals, where we are charging the vacation rental owner and HomeAway or Airbnb, we'll charge a lot to the consumer. The takes rates are actually quite a equivalent when you look at the total take rate. I think anyone with charge to the owner but if you don't have been instantly verifiable deal, then you might be a word nerd first ever showed up, or he didn't stay or we didn't close the transaction. So we're actually in an enviable position to be able to do the way we do. Obviously, I don't -- I only met a consumer who only likes to pay fees. And we're betting that, that consumers won't want to pay fees. But more importantly, what we're trying to do is make booking a vacation rental or a home or an apartment as easy as booking a hotel room, with the same level of trust, with the same feeling like you're going to get what you paid for. There's no post-negotiation on price, which happens sometimes on a non-request model. There's no post-negotiation. Maybe, I want you to stay -- or actually, my room's not available right now. And I believe that is where our model will ultimately end up, getting from where we are today to where we need to, there's certainly, still a lot of friction. But we're finding pretty positive response to this model and it's also, I think is a nice way to set expectations with both the booker and the place that they're booking. And so we're sticking with that model, it seems to be working for us.

And that was a combination of less people booking and significant increase in cancellations of bookings that were already in our system. But then such a solid bounce back in December and such a great quarter overall, from a top line and bottom line perspective that we didn't go and try to quantify any kind of an EBITDA impact to report to you. I don't feel like there's really anything to explain there. So I feel good with a quarter that we delivered despite the impact. For Easter, we don't have a number there are either and there's a lot of travel that happens right around Easter, and we expect that, that will move from Q2 last year into Q1. But there are other breaks that people get that are just kind of around the time of Easter or I know from Mike's -- our break is still going to be in April this year, so I don't know that we could precisely quantify for you the exact impact there. But it is beneficial to revenue in Q1. It would be a little bit of a detrimental revenue in Q2. From a gross profit perspective -- sorry, gross bookings perspective, it's probably a little bit negative to Q1 and that during that period, where people are traveling, the bookings really drop off to a lower level because they're not booking while they're traveling. So that is the way to think about that intensive gross bookings. And then summer comps, yes, it was a very strong summer season for us. It's too early to predict now. We're not giving getting's for summer, but we said that our prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about the macro-travel environment right now, and hope that will continue into the summer and -- paired with lower fuel prices, lower airline ticket prices, hopefully, mean strong -- some good tailwinds for summer travel."

Paris still is impacted where it was pre-attire for us and as a share of our business but has bounced back from where it was. And so I think we benefit also from being a global player with so many different choices where people can travel to.

Well, we haven't seen any major impacts but it's been a great experimental bid. And I think one of the biggest learnings and I had mentioned in the previous comments is, customers aren't going to overpay for a product. So if the properties are free to price the product the way they want to price it, but if it's overpriced, then it won't convert, and then they don't get any business. So in a way, the marketplace has a self-actualization to it, regardless of what the rules are. We still believe parity is a very important construct. We think it frankly offers a lot of opportunity also for the properties to have a level playing field so that we're not using our margins, undercut them. But I'm now comfortable with any regime, that people realize if they want to get bookings on Booking, you have to have a well-priced product and the marketplace deals with that. And if you don't, then nothing sales, conversion goes down, your ranking goes down. And then you don't get any business. So it's been interesting. All of our checks would say that parity in France is at least, if not more healthy, than most of our markets in the world. And I think that's overall, a good news."

I think, first of all, it's important to understand how the ranking algorithm works. The primary driver of helping the rank is conversion, so it really is consumer interest. And you always have to be very careful in how you balance monetization with consumer interest. Because if you overweighed on monetization, you could never really, the results and no one wants to come to your website. So at least the way we've done it in the past is we have standard hotels the preferred hotels. And preferred hotels are only allowed to become preferred if they meet a number of experienced criteria. And then they have slightly higher commission, and can often as much, doubled their bookings by being preferred. That's been our primary driver. The second one that we do allow some overrides. They're not used broadly, but in the hotel can pay more commission if they want, stay at a new hotel they don't have a lot of reviews or something, to try and get a slightly higher ranking, but it's never -- we never allow them ultimately, to buy the very top of the ranking from the very bottom. It doesn't work that way. So we feel comfortable with the model that we have. I think it's a very -- like in any auction site, you have to really be careful with the diode, because you think you might win the monetization but if you crop of the product, then you're not going to have any customers. So that's the way I think about it. And your next question was -- Dan, why don't you take the Zika?"

Welcome to The Priceline Group's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for joining us before the market opened this morning in New York.

Thank you for joining us before the market opened this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
The group reported another solid quarter, with consolidated gross bookings of approximately $12 billion, up about 24% on a constant-currency basis or 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 99 million room nights in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year. Gross profit was up 12% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 11% to $790 million. 
And finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $12.63, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.81 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Now I'd like to take a moment and reflect back on our full year results. Our customers made reservations for over 432 million room nights on Priceline Group platforms in 2015, over twice as many as our next biggest competitor. Despite the law of large numbers, we organically grew this business at 25%, down only 3 percentage points from 2014's growth rate, and exited the year growing more quickly than we were growing when we entered it. The business was very profitable, generating $3.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 42.6% non-GAAP operating profit margin.
I believe that the solid performance in 2015 and many consecutive years of strong growth and profitability have been made possible by competitive advantages we have developed through the skill and hard work of our people around the world. 
Our capabilities in scale and partner acquisition, customer experience and efficient demand generation, plus our large installed base of accommodations and loyal travelers, give The Priceline Group a competitive moat that is deep and wide.
Let me expand on this point a bit. Being a leader in online travel and building an experienced marketplace isn't achieved by simply electronically connecting demand with supply. It may be a surprise to some, but about 2/3 of our employees are working on either the supply or customer service organizations. Only KAYAK, our one media asset, does not have a similar model. Our employees work out of 239 support offices in 173 cities around the world, working daily with partners and customers to deliver the absolute best booking experience wherever our customer comes from and wherever they're going.
On the supply side, we added over 200,000 properties during the year on Booking.com, covering everything from igloos to shared stays while maintaining stable take rates and a fee-free model to the customer. Booking.com now has over 850 hotels -- 850,000 hotels, homes and other places to stay in over 220 countries and territories across the globe, up 34% from last year. 
The hard work of making this a daily reality is achieved by thousands of dedicated and energetic people around the world, adding these properties and then working with our partners on an ongoing basis to ensure that our customers have the most choices of place to stay at the best prices available.
We offer by far the most directly bookable lodging choices to our customers, with over 22.6 million rooms potentially available on our websites, including 6.9 million rooms in vacation rentals and other nonhotel properties. With our worldwide team and market-leading profitability, we are expanding this low-friction model more aggressively into the single-owner, single-room market as it continuous to mature. We strongly believe that this fee-free experience-centric model, which makes booking homes and apartments as easy and trustworthy as booking a hotel, will be the winning model long term.
On the customer experience side, the complexity of providing a world-class digital experience for customers becomes more daunting each year with various browsers and operating systems offered on desktop and mobile devices. On top of that, you have new platforms and capabilities being built every day. And for each of these, we need to make an intelligent decision about where and how to participate. 
The good news is that tools are becoming better and customers continue to want to live more of their lives digitally. We have over 2,500 talented developers and other technology professionals working across our brands to offer our customers the best online booking experience on our desktop and mobile websites and apps, optimized through hundreds of thousands of experiments.
We believe Booking.com has the highest converting online accommodation reservation path in the world, achieved through a deeply ingrained culture of innovation that results in experimentation at a transactional data scale and velocities that few companies can match. 
Our content is best in class with high-resolution photos, detailed property descriptions and 77 million-plus verified and fresh reviews for properties in even the most far-flung destinations. We have thousands of customer service professionals stationed all over the world, helping our customers in 42 languages 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
We think our approach adds up to a great experience for our customers, which helps us continue to grow the direct share of our business with outstanding everyday pricing and repeat traffic versus the alternative, which is to buy the business with coupons or discounting transaction by transaction. 
Booking.com surpassed 100 million customer accounts during 2015 and had our 1 billionth guest stay at one of our partners, approximately 300 million of those in 2015 alone, another testament to our success at earning long-term loyalty.
We invested $3 billion in marketing during 2015 to build our brands around the world and bring new customers to our website at profitable ROIs. Our historical competitive strengths from the desktop have translated very well to mobile. Our talented teams use proprietary quantitative tools to manage bidding on hundreds of millions of multilingual keywords across desktop and mobile platforms, successfully balancing ROI discipline with strong growth. We continue to command a leading share of the demand channels we participate in, profitably converting shoppers into buyers and buyers into loyal long-term customers.
Every year is an investment year at The Priceline Group, while every year is also an opportunity to deliver outstanding bottom line results. We evaluate every opportunity with a long-term lens, requiring that it deliver value for our brand franchises tomorrow, beyond just delivering transactions today. 
2016 will be no different as we invest in exciting new opportunities like OpenTable's international expansion, our BookingSuite cloud software offers, our Booking.com for Business, while maintaining superior operating margins that will allow us to win in the face of heated competition.
And you can be confident that we're not standing still. The Priceline Group will continue to work hard to stay a step ahead of the competition with our unique combination of institutional know-how, culture systems and focused passion. We don't take any competitor lightly, and we compete ferociously every day, continuously seeking a higher executional gear in every facet of our business.
Booking.com, of course, makes up the majority of our business. However, the group also has a portfolio of valuable and complementary brands, each of which makes money and has the aspiration to grow and build vertical mastery in their respective area of focus. We have new leadership at priceline.com and OpenTable, and both businesses are responding with a renewed energy and a strong commitment to profitable growth.
Agoda and rentalcars.com both continue to improve and differentiate their respective products, and both look to drive more business direct and through improved mobile experiences. And finally, KAYAK is an outstanding business that is being smartly run and continues to contribute to the group beyond our initial expectations.
I give these other brand teams a lot of independence, and this has engendered a real performance-driven culture. Through our portfolio of brands, we aspire to achieve the group's mission to help people experience the world and become a global marketplace for experiences. 
I thank my colleagues around the world for delivering another great year. Their skill and dedication has helped build a great business, with strong competitive advantages that have been responsible for our past success and will help us continue to succeed in the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan?"

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q4 was a strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with accelerating room night growth and the second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all channels and geographic regions, which we believe indicates a generally healthy macro travel environment. 
Our global room night growth rate declined by more than 10 percentage points for a 2- to 3-week period after the terrorist attack in Paris, compared to what it had been before the attack. Growth bounced back strongly in December, and this momentum has carried over in Q1, as I will discuss further when I get to guidance.
Room nights booked grew by 27% in the fourth quarter, accelerating compared to the 22% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 11% in Q4 compared to Q3 growth of 13%. 
Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by 1% for the consolidated group. Foreign exchange rates again presented a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar and to our business mix, which skews heavily internationally.
Our Q4 gross bookings grew by about 24% on a constant currency basis but by only about 13% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by 16% expressed in U.S. dollars.
Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 8%. We believe U.S. performance was impacted by TV advertising decreases in the second half of 2015 as the priceline.com team transitioned their new brand campaign, which recently launched in Q1. 
In addition, global airfares were down by about 15% over the last several months, according to KAYAK flight search data, which significantly impacts priceline.com's gross bookings growth but has no impact on gross profit growth.
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $1.9 billion and grew by about 23% on a constant currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our gross profit take rates remain stable as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been and should continue to be sustainable due to our position as a relatively low-cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our partners.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.6 billion, which grew by about 25% on a constant currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $268 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year. 
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable revenues, grew by 17% in Q4 compared to the prior year.
Operating margins exceeded our guidance and were similar to Q4 last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.3% of gross profit for Q4 compared to 41.4% in Q4 last year. Online ad ROIs were better than our forecast, but online advertising delevered compared to the prior year due to the acceleration in gross bookings late in the quarter, which will benefit revenue in Q1 and beyond when checkouts occur, as well as the impact of the terrorist attack on cancellations.
Off-line advertising came in slightly favorable to our forecast and is down year-over-year due to a shift in spend from off-line to online advertising for KAYAK, reduced advertising at priceline.com, as I mentioned a moment ago, and the impact of foreign exchange rates on Booking.com's off-line advertising expense, which grew by 18% in euros.
Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and only generated 11 bps of margin pressure compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $790 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $760 million and grew by 11% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Non-GAAP net income increased by 11%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 16%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $881 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2015, which is about 17% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. 
For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and spent $174 million on CapEx, which means about 34% of our gross profit converted into free cash flow. We used our cash during the year to repurchase 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 billion. Darren just spoke about some of our operational competitive advantages. 
I believe that our market-leading profit margins, free cash flow, impeccable balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit rating collectively constitute a competitive advantage that gives us significant financial flexibility to invest in our business to drive growth and positions us favorably versus our competitors.
Our board recently gave us a new authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute this program consistent with the pattern we have established over the last couple of years to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense based on the price at which our stock is trading and potential other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2015, with about $800 million of that balance in the U.S.
Now for Q1 guidance. Our quarter is off to a strong start, as I mentioned a moment ago. Some of the strength in December and thus far in Q1 is likely attributable to Chinese New Year, Carnival and Easter happening earlier this year. Leap year also helps our forecast slightly relative to last year by adding an extra day to the quarter. Although we worry about macro weakness evident in slowing economic growth, dropping oil prices and stock market volatility, the macro travel environment appears healthy to us. 
Lower oil prices have contributed to significantly lower airline ticket prices and leave consumers with more discretionary funds that are available for travel. 
Lastly and most importantly, a combination of strong core execution and the benefits of a number of growth investments we have been making are helping to drive the group's success. And I sincerely thank my colleagues around the world for their efforts.
Our growth continues to be strong across all channels and regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We are pleased with the brand marketing we get through TripAdvisor's Instant Book ad placement, but given the relative size of our business and our experience so far, we don't expect that Instant Book will significantly impact our top line growth or ad efficiency.
Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.44 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 2% for the euro and about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
Many other currencies in which we transact are also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar than they were in Q1 last year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1. 
As you can see in our guidance, the Q1 impact of currency fluctuations on our dollar reported figures, while still meaningful, is less severe than what we experienced during 2015. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, the year-over-year currency comps will become even less challenging after Q1. 
As I mentioned when we reported last quarter, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished through the relative size of our priceline.com business to our consolidated results and because our other 2 U.S. brands, KAYAK and OpenTable, do not have gross travel bookings. The metric also excludes the U.S. inbound, outbound and domestic business for Booking.com. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business as we have in the past to give insight into its performance. We are also adding guidance for consolidated room night growth to give visibility for this important metric. 
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 27% and total gross bookings to grow by 18% to 25% on a constant currency basis and by 12% to 19% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 16%. We expect gross profit to grow by 20% to 27% on a constant currency basis and by 14% to 21% in U.S. dollars.
We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency. 
Our online advertising efficiency forecast as usual assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $580 million and $620 million, which at the midpoint is an increase of 13% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9 to $9.60 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 15% versus prior year. 
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.5 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015. 
We forecast GAAP EPS between $6.90 and $7.50 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges did not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.

We knew at the time we acquired it that we might have to make some changes in leadership. Christa has done an awesome job. The team hit all of its Q4 KPIs, and these are all about how do we get medium- to long-term momentum. We are currently primarily in the United States, but we also have operations in Japan, the U.K., Germany. We've made an acquisition with AS Digital to put us into Australia. There are also, by the way, a number of restaurants that use OpenTable software all around the world although we may not have a consumer-facing site. The whole process of globalizing OpenTable has been -- you see recently their latest app update allows Americans to book in London. You'd think that was the simplest thing and that should have been done years ago, but there you go, it's done now. And this allows the app to become global. There's more things around languages as well. So if you go to book a restaurant in Germany and you're from the United States, so you'll be able to see the menu and the product in English. And that's the kind of work that's going on. And as that replatforming gets done, and we expect that work to be done in this year, then we have some amazing tools to be able to offer both the software proposition to restaurants as well as the demand proposition. You'll see on Booking.com, for instance, if you search New York, we've got a beautiful little ad there that says, hey, book a restaurant in New York through OpenTable. Those things we found to be positive experiments. So that's where we are. I'm optimistic. I think ultimately, there is a traveler network effect. Our restaurants are a more local business than, say, hotel staying, of course. But on the other hand, transient travelers are extremely valuable to restaurants. I mean, filling those last few tables can often be the difference between making money and not making money. And they realize that those travelers have choice, and they're relatively not near as informed as maybe local people. And we think that's a valuable business, and we're seeing good results so far, but there's still a lot more work to do."

And we talked about the 22.6 million rooms we have on our website. In Europe, we're actually still adding a lot of properties, but because this is our most mature market, those properties are becoming smaller and smaller. By the way, they're still tremendously valuable because all of these smaller properties add tremendous diversity to our accommodation base, therefore being able to fit very specific needs. They also help us in low availability times. If there's a conference or something, these properties can help fill demand when you're in a supply-constrained environment. So Europe has a lot of properties in -- that are getting smaller and smaller. And that's the nature of the European business. And for instance, in Italy, at a time, we're adding 100 properties a day because these are very small properties in small places, kind of mom and pop operated-type product. In other parts of the world, we're still adding many large multiroom. I think India and China in particular. China, we've gone -- entered the year with about 6,500 properties, exited the year with 35,000 properties. A lot of that was organically built. In China, we have a lot more to do just adding really large hotels and properties. The challenge in China is making sure you have enough domestic demand to fill those. Inbound China is not a huge market, but domestic China is a huge market, and we're filling those beds through partnerships within China, including our relationship with Ctrip. India is another one that has -- that seems to have unending potential for us, and we're busy there building out that marketplace. I'd say another part of the world is Africa, Central America. These are areas still where we're adding hotels. But at some point, we will have most of the world's hotels, and then there's still a lot of extra property count in these single owner, single apartment-type product, almost endless to some degree, it seems. But we're having to add those, a room/property at a time, and that's obviously important and tough work."

There's -- one is in the absolute level of a currency, and the other issue is volatility. And a lower euro has a big impact, but it's also the movement in the euro because people need to get used to the fact that the euro is now $1.11 and no longer $1.35. So we certainly see now that the euro is stabilized that that's had a positive impact on year-over-year base of Europeans starting to travel back to America, starting to travel to the U.K., starting to travel to higher currency zones. I think the other point that Dan made, the KAYAK data that shows that flights are down 15% year-over-year, that actually plays into the travel budget as well. So we're seeing more positive flows for -- of Europeans into these higher currency markets. It certainly hasn't recovered to the time of the $1.35 euro, but it's more positive than it was a year ago. That said, intra-EU travel is still -- we're seeing very positive impacts there. There were -- there's a number of crises in the world, Tunisia, Egypt, even Turkey. The positive there for us is that many of these markets are wholesale kind of package travel markets. We have properties there, but they're traditionally sort of the Thomas Cooks, the TUIs of the world. And a lot of that travel is now ending up in Italy, in Spain and Southern France, and that's more of a retail market that plays also to our strength. And that's another trend we've been seeing recently."

Off-line advertising, we're going to heavy up in periods where we think we've got good creative, and it's moving the needle for us. But over the long term, we expect that we would have leverage there, too. We'll hit a level of spending that we think is the right level in a market and both hit the number of markets that we think we should be in, and then our business should continue to grow faster than our spend would. So then the biggest expense is also the biggest barrier, and that's the online advertising. We're very pleased with what we've seen with the efficiency over the last couple of quarters, but we've had 3 years before that of seeing pressure on that metric and pressure on ROIs year-over-year. And so it's difficult to predict what will happen there for the future. I have great confidence that we are probably better positioned than anybody else in the market with the most choices to try and convert that paid traffic into a booking on the best websites, the best converting websites from a desktop and mobile perspective, with the most clever advertising teams really tailoring our bidding approach and using best-in-class tools to make sure that we spend our money efficiently.

So Booking.com for Business, it's a -- it's worth just giving here a little bit of background. So we -- our sites primarily -- have primarily been targeted at leisure, and over time, we've seen more customers come in for business purposes. And that's when we started to make some changes to our site and see if we could get positive conversion, and that seemed to work. So now you can go on our site and say, ""Am I traveling for leisure or business?"" And if you pick business, we highlight things important to businesspeople, and they seem to like that. And we've also discovered that about 20% of our business is business bookings versus leisure bookings. And the thesis, of course, is that -- nobody really knows but maybe half of travels business. It could be more or less than that, but that points to a pretty big opportunity if we serve that customer well. So then secondly, we built a very simple tool that allows the systems to book for businesspeople. It allows you to track budgets. It allows a manager to track where all their people are from a care of duty perspective. And now we're also optimizing that tool. We are seeing that our business bookings are growing faster than our leisure bookings, which means they're taking share on the site. That's what we want to see, but it's a process of optimization and investment. And obviously, if you just think of the sheer size of the numbers that are going from 20% to 50%, for instance, that's a huge opportunity. But we're approaching it in a very typical Booking.com-Priceline Group way, which is many small steps, lots of optimization. And we're feeling positive. I think it will be one of those things that continues to contribute. There's no massive revolutionary move but more an evolutionary optimization, and today, feeling great about the progress but a lot more to do. Your second question, China outbound, some of it is hard to pick through when -- because of Chinese New Year, which is such a big holiday. And you guys have seen the pictures on the Internet in the train stations full of hundreds of thousands of people. It was another great Chinese New Year, but the real question is where the things swing out. We did see, let's say, a little bit of softness. Now but China softness is all relative. It's still a fast-growing market, but a little bit of softness in outbound in kind of Q3, Q4, a strong Chinese New Year, and then we have to see from there where it goes. Obviously, the situation in China and the headlines can also rattle travelers. We haven't seen any large material effect. And I also believe our long-term thesis around China certainly hasn't changed. They are the world's largest outbound travelers, and we're going to continue to try to take a bigger share of that business going forward."

Yes, well, as you point out, I mean, depending on what you call a chain, we -- about 10% to 15% of our business is a combination of global and regional chains, and we're always in contract negotiations with the chains. In fact, our take rate is quite stable. With many chains, we never had last room availability. But over time, they've given us more availability partly because it's good business. We bring in a transient traveler. Very few of our travelers stay at the same hotel twice. And this is valuable business because it's incremental. I think what you're seeing is discomfort with maybe the way the world is changing, but you should know our relationships are quite tight. There's also a difference between the chain and the owner of the hotel. I mean, the owner of the hotel wants more of this kind of business, and most of them want to lean into our model. For me, the average chain hotel only gets about half of the business that should be coming to us partly because of all of these restrictions that are put on it. But many chain owners are also agitating to make sure they get their fair share because the business they're not getting is either going to another chain or it's going to an independent hotel. So yes, I don't appreciate some of the actions that they have taken at the chain level at times, but our relationships on a day-to-day basis are actually quite constructive and cordial, and our chain business is actually quite healthy. They have great product. Our customers want the product. But most of our customers, when they come to Washington, D.C., for instance, they're not looking for the Hilton or the Marriott in Washington. They're looking for a great bed in Washington. And our ranking system presents to them business that's well priced. And if the product is not well priced or it's not available, it's not going to convert, and therefore, it won't be presented to the customer. That's basically the way it works, and I'm always hopeful we can work through many of these issues when they arise."

That's the way our entire business works. And -- but if you look at our take rate in vacation rentals where we are charging the vacation rental owner and HomeAway or Airbnb, we'll charge a lot to the consumer, the takes rates are actually quite equivalent when you look at the total take rate. I think anyone would rather charge to the owner, but if you don't have an instantly verifiable deal, you might be worried if the owner's going to fail or the person never showed up or he didn't stay or we didn't close the transaction. So we're actually in an enviable position to be able to do it the way we do. Obviously, I don't think I ever met a consumer who likes to pay fees, and we're betting that consumers won't want to pay fees. But more importantly, what we're trying to do is make booking a vacation rental or a home or an apartment as easy as booking a hotel room with the same level of trust, with the same feeling like you're going to get what you pay for. There's no post-negotiation on price, which happens sometimes on a non-request model. There's no post-negotiation. Maybe, I want you to stay or oh, actually, my room's not available now. And I believe that's where the model will ultimately end up. Getting from where we are today to where we need to, there's certainly still a lot of friction. But we're finding pretty positive response to this model, and it also, I think, is a nice way to set expectations with both the booker and the place that they're booking. And so we're sticking with that model. It seems to be working for us. But still, a lot of work to do, but we're playing a sort of a long game here that I think that more experience-centric, friction-free models are the future versus what -- how the business is being done today."

I don't feel like there's really anything to explain there, so I feel good with the quarter that we delivered despite the impact. For Easter, we don't have a number there either. I mean, there's a lot of travel that happens right around Easter, and we expect that, that will move from Q2 last year into Q1. But there are other breaks that people get that are just kind of around the time of Easter or I know from my kids, their break is still going to be in April this year. So I don't know that we could precisely quantify for you the exact impact there, but it is beneficial to revenue in Q1. It will be a little bit of a detriment to revenue in Q2. From a gross profit perspective -- sorry, gross bookings perspective, it's probably a little bit negative to Q1 in that during that period where people are traveling, the bookings really drop off to a lower level because they're not booking while they're traveling. So that is the way to think about that in terms of gross bookings. And then summer comps, yes, it was a very strong summer season for us. It's too early to predict now. We're not giving guidance for summer, but we said in our prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about the macro travel environment right now and hope that will continue into the summer and, paired with lower fuel prices, lower airline ticket prices, hopefully mean some good tailwinds for summer travel."

Paris still isn't back to where it was pre-attack for us and as a share of our business but has bounced back from where it was. And so I think we benefit also from being a global player with so many different choices where people can travel to. But if they're not comfortable with a particular destination, they can find other places where they may feel more comfortable with traveling. So really, just the resilience would be the one thing that we'd point to that -- thank God, there were no additional attacks, and so the business bounced back."

Well, yes, on the -- on vacation rentals generally and I would say self-catered products as well is what we call -- this includes apartments and homes and aparthotels, that's a -- that part of the market has traditionally had a lot more friction in it than the hotel booking side. And as that friction gets removed, you begin to see growth. Certainly, there's the sort of Airbnb effect of this being a new way to travel. But more importantly, for large groups, families booking a self-catered product or a home, it's actually a really good deal, and price-value equation looks great. But it's always had all kinds of fiction around, well, is it going to be there? Where does my money go? They want a deposit, et cetera, et cetera. And as we remove those points of friction, we're seeing good growth in that area. I don't have any numbers to share, but that space is growing faster than our core business, which is what you would hope. And we feel like we have plenty of demand as we get ready supply to fill those rooms with guests who are looking for them. The other question was on Instant Book. Yes, it's still very early days, but we're happy with the way that TripAdvisor has fulfilled their side of the deal. The branding looks great. It seems to -- particularly, in the U.S. market where the early rollout has been, where the Booking.com brand is not as strong, I think that's helped us a lot. They're now rolling out in the markets maybe where we're stronger. Maybe it will help them a bit where our brand might even be stronger than TripAdvisor's. But I think from a mutual perspective, it's been positive. There's a lot yet to optimize, but we sort of think about it as -- well, we've got an ad, and we have a performance tool to drive more business, and that's always a real positive thing for the company. I'm still, by the way, optimistic, still very supportive. And let's see where things end up as Steve and his team get to roll this product out to more markets."

And then second question, similar. The Innovation Box Tax regime in the Netherlands seems like it's in a bit of flux. Can you just give us kind of a sense of how much of your pretax income flows through at the reduced tax rate and how you think either rates or the magnitude of the shield are likely to change over the next few years?

Well, we haven't seen any major impact, but it's been a great experimental bed. And I think one of the biggest learnings, and I had mentioned this in the previous comment, is customers aren't going to overpay for a product. So if the properties are free to price the product the way they want to price it but if it's overpriced, then it won't convert, and then they don't get any business. So in a way, the marketplace has this self-actualization to it regardless of what the rules are. We still believe parity is a very important construct. We think it, frankly, offers a lot of opportunity also for the properties to have a level playing field so that we're not using our margins to undercut them. But I'm now more comfortable with any regime that people realize if they want to get bookings on Booking, you have to have a well-priced product, and the marketplace deals with that. And if you don't, then nothing sells, conversion goes down, your ranking goes down, and then you don't get any business. So it's been interesting. All of our checks would say that parity in France is at least if not more healthy than most of our markets in the world, and I think that's overall good news."

And then there's also developments at the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where they're looking to harmonize tax treatment across European Union. And one of the things that they're taking into consideration is these Innovation Box-type regimes, and they've talked about doing away with them sometime in 2021. So that's certainly risk out there. 2021 is still a long way away, and tax is subject to change, rates could change, and the OECD's interpretations could change.

I think first of all, it's important to understand how the ranking algorithm works. The primary driver helping with your rank is conversion, so it really is consumer interest. And you always have to be very careful in how you balance monetization with consumer interest because if you overweight on monetization, you can have really poor-quality results, and then no one wants to come to your website. So at least the way we've done it in the past is we have standard hotels and preferred hotels, and preferred hotels are only allowed to become preferred if they meet a number of experience criteria. And then they pay us a slightly higher commission and can often as much as double their bookings by being preferred. That's been our primary driver. The second one, we do allow some overrides. They're not used broadly, but a hotel can pay us even more commission if they want, say, it's a new hotel, they don't have a lot of reviews or something, to try and get a slightly higher ranking. But it never -- we never allow them ultimately to buy the very top of the ranking from the very bottom. It doesn't work that way. So we feel comfortable with the model that we have. I think it's a very -- like in any auction site, you have to really be careful with the dials because you think you might win a monetization, but if you crap up the product, then you're not going to have any customers. So that's the way I think about it. And your next question was -- Dan, you want to take Zika."

Welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the market opened this morning in New York.

Thank you for joining us before the market opened this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
The group reported another solid quarter, with consolidated gross bookings of approximately $12 billion, up about 24% on a constant currency basis or 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 99 million room nights in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year. Gross profit was up 12% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 11% to $790 million. 
And finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $12.63, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.81 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Now I'd like to take a moment and reflect back on our full year results. Our customers made reservations for over 432 million room nights on Priceline Group platforms in 2015, over twice as many as our next biggest competitor. Despite the law of large numbers, we organically grew this business at 25%, down only 3 percentage points from 2014's growth rate, and exited the year growing more quickly than we were growing when we entered it. The business was very profitable, generating $3.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 42.6% non-GAAP operating profit margin.
I believe that the solid performance in 2015 and many consecutive years of strong growth and profitability have been made possible by competitive advantages we have developed through the skill and hard work of our people around the world. 
Our capabilities in scale and partner acquisition, customer experience and efficient demand generation, plus our large installed base of accommodations and loyal travelers, give The Priceline Group a competitive moat that is deep and wide.
Let me expand on this point a bit. Being a leader in online travel and building an experienced marketplace isn't achieved by simply electronically connecting demand with supply. It may be a surprise to some, but about 2/3 of our employees are working on either the supply or customer service organizations. Only KAYAK, our one media asset, does not have a similar model. Our employees work out of 239 support offices in 173 cities around the world, working daily with partners and customers to deliver the absolute best booking experience wherever our customer comes from and wherever they're going.
On the supply side, we added over 200,000 properties during the year on Booking.com, covering everything from igloos to shared stays while maintaining stable take rates and a fee-free model to the customer. Booking.com now has over 850 hotels -- 850,000 hotels, homes and other places to stay in over 220 countries and territories across the globe, up 34% from last year. 
The hard work of making this a daily reality is achieved by thousands of dedicated and energetic people around the world, adding these properties and then working with our partners on an ongoing basis to ensure that our customers have the most choices of places to stay at the best prices available.
We offer by far the most directly bookable lodging choices to our customers, with over 22.6 million rooms potentially available on our websites, including 6.9 million rooms in vacation rentals and other nonhotel properties. With our worldwide team and market-leading profitability, we are expanding this low-friction model more aggressively into the single-owner, single-room market as it continues to mature. We strongly believe that this fee-free experience-centric model, which makes booking homes and apartments as easy and trustworthy as booking a hotel, will be the winning model long term.
On the customer experience side, the complexity of providing a world-class digital experience for customers becomes more daunting each year with various browsers and operating systems offered on desktop and mobile devices. On top of that, you have new platforms and capabilities being built every day. And for each of these, we need to make an intelligent decision about where and how to participate. 
The good news is that tools are becoming better and customers continue to want to live more of their lives digitally. We have over 2,500 talented developers and other technology professionals working across our brands to offer our customers the best online booking experience on our desktop and mobile websites and apps, optimized through hundreds of thousands of experiments.
We believe Booking.com has the highest converting online accommodation reservation path in the world, achieved through a deeply ingrained culture of innovation that results in experimentation at a transactional data scale and velocities that few companies can match. 
Our content is best in class with high-resolution photos, detailed property descriptions and 77 million-plus verified and fresh reviews for properties in even the most far-flung destinations. We have thousands of customer service professionals stationed all over the world, helping our customers in 42 languages 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
We think our approach adds up to a great experience for our customers, which helps us continue to grow the direct share of our business with outstanding everyday pricing and repeat traffic versus the alternative, which is to buy the business with coupons or discounting transaction-by-transaction. 
Booking.com surpassed 100 million customer accounts during 2015 and had our 1 billionth guest stay at one of our partners, approximately 300 million of those in 2015 alone, another testament to our success at earning long-term loyalty.
We invested $3 billion in marketing during 2015 to build our brands around the world and bring new customers to our website at profitable ROIs. Our historical competitive strengths on the desktop have translated very well to mobile. Our talented teams use proprietary quantitative tools to manage bidding on hundreds of millions of multilingual keywords across desktop and mobile platforms, successfully balancing ROI discipline with strong growth. We continue to command a leading share of the demand channels we participate in, profitably converting shoppers into buyers and buyers into loyal long-term customers.
Every year is an investment year at The Priceline Group, while every year is also an opportunity to deliver outstanding bottom line results. We evaluate every opportunity with a long-term lens, requiring that it deliver value for our brand franchises tomorrow, beyond just delivering transactions today. 
2016 will be no different as we invest in exciting new opportunities like OpenTable's international expansion, our BookingSuite cloud software offers, our Booking.com for Business, while maintaining superior operating margins that will allow us to win in the face of heated competition.
And you can be confident that we're not standing still. The Priceline Group will continue to work hard to stay a step ahead of the competition with our unique combination of institutional know-how, culture, systems and focused passion. We don't take any competitor lightly, and we compete ferociously every day, continuously seeking a higher executional gear in every facet of our business.
Booking.com, of course, makes up the majority of our business. However, the group also has a portfolio of valuable and complementary brands, each of which makes money and has the aspiration to grow and build vertical mastery in their respective area of focus. We have new leadership at priceline.com and OpenTable, and both businesses are responding with a renewed energy and a strong commitment to profitable growth.
Agoda and rentalcars.com both continue to improve and differentiate their respective products, and both look to drive more business direct and through improved mobile experiences. And finally, KAYAK is an outstanding business that is being smartly run and continues to contribute to the group beyond our initial expectations.
I give these other brand teams a lot of independence, and this has engendered a real performance-driven culture. Through our portfolio of brands, we aspire to achieve the group's mission to help people experience the world and become a global marketplace for experiences. 
I thank my colleagues around the world for delivering another great year. Their skill and dedication has helped build a great business, with strong competitive advantages that have been responsible for our past success and will help us continue to succeed in the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan?"

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q4 was a strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with accelerating room night growth and the second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all channels and geographic regions, which we believe indicates a generally healthy macro travel environment. 
Our global room night growth rate declined by more than 10 percentage points for a 2- to 3-week period after the terrorist attack in Paris, compared to what it had been before the attack. Growth bounced back strongly in December, and this momentum has carried over in Q1, as I will discuss further when I get to guidance.
Room nights booked grew by 27% in the fourth quarter, accelerating compared to the 22% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 11% in Q4 compared to Q3 growth of 13%. 
Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by 1% for the consolidated group. Foreign exchange rates again presented a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar and to our business mix, which skews heavily internationally.
Our Q4 gross bookings grew by about 24% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 13% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by 16% expressed in U.S. dollars.
Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 8%. We believe U.S. performance was impacted by TV advertising decreases in the second half of 2015 as the priceline.com team transitioned to their new brand campaign, which recently launched in Q1. 
In addition, global airfares were down by about 15% over the last several months, according to KAYAK flight search data, which significantly impacts priceline.com's gross bookings growth but has no impact on gross profit growth.
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $1.9 billion and grew by about 23% on a constant currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our gross profit take rates remain stable, as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been and should continue to be sustainable due to our position as a relatively low-cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our partners.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.6 billion, which grew by about 25% on a constant currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $268 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year. 
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable revenues, grew by 17% in Q4 compared to the prior year.
Operating margins exceeded our guidance and were similar to Q4 last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.3% of gross profit for Q4 compared to 41.4% in Q4 last year. Online ad ROIs were better than our forecast, but online advertising delevered compared to the prior year due to the acceleration in gross bookings late in the quarter, which will benefit revenue in Q1 and beyond when checkouts occur, as well as the impact of the terrorist attack on cancellations.
Off-line advertising came in slightly favorable to our forecast and is down year-over-year due to a shift in spend from off-line to online advertising for KAYAK, reduced advertising at priceline.com, as I mentioned a moment ago, and the impact of foreign exchange rates on Booking.com's off-line advertising expense, which grew by 18% in euros.
Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and only generated 11 bps of margin pressure compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $790 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $760 million and grew by 11% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Non-GAAP net income increased by 11%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 16%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $881 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2015, which is about 17% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. 
For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and spent $174 million on CapEx, which means about 34% of our gross profit converted into free cash flow. We used our cash during the year to repurchase 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 billion. Darren just spoke about some of our operational competitive advantages. 
I believe that our market-leading profit margins, free cash flow, impeccable balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit rating collectively constitute a competitive advantage that gives us significant financial flexibility to invest in our business to drive growth, and positions us favorably versus our competitors.
Our board recently gave us a new authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute this program consistent with the pattern we have established over the last couple of years to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense based on the price at which our stock is trading and potential other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2015, with about $800 million of that balance in the U.S.
Now for Q1 guidance. Our quarter is off to a strong start, as I mentioned a moment ago. Some of the strength in December and thus far in Q1 is likely attributable to Chinese New Year, Carnival and Easter happening earlier this year. Leap year also helps our forecast slightly relative to last year by adding an extra day to the quarter. Although we worry about macro weakness evident in slowing economic growth, dropping oil prices and stock market volatility, the macro travel environment appears healthy to us. 
Lower oil prices have contributed to significantly lower airline ticket prices and leave consumers with more discretionary funds that are available for travel. 
Lastly and most importantly, a combination of strong core execution and the benefits of a number of growth investments we have been making are helping to drive the group's success. And I sincerely thank my colleagues around the world for their efforts.
Our growth continues to be strong across all channels and regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We are pleased with the brand marketing we get through TripAdvisor's Instant Book ad placement, but given the relative size of our business and our experience so far, we don't expect that Instant Book will significantly impact our top line growth or ad efficiency.
Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.44 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 2% for the euro and about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
Many other currencies in which we transact are also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar than they were in Q1 last year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1. 
As you can see in our guidance, the Q1 impact of currency fluctuations on our dollar reported figures, while still meaningful, is less severe than what we experienced during 2015. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, the year-over-year currency comps will become even less challenging after Q1. 
As I mentioned when we reported last quarter, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished due to the relative size of our priceline.com business to our consolidated results and because our other 2 U.S. brands, KAYAK and OpenTable, do not have gross travel bookings. The metric also excludes the U.S. inbound, outbound and domestic business for Booking.com. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business as we have in the past to give insight into its performance. We are also adding guidance for consolidated room night growth to give visibility for this important metric. 
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 27% and total gross bookings to grow by 18% to 25% on a constant currency basis and by 12% to 19% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior-year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 16%. We expect gross profit to grow by 20% to 27% on a constant currency basis and by 14% to 21% in U.S. dollars.
We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency. 
Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $580 million and $620 million, which at the midpoint is an increase of 13% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9 to $9.60 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 15% versus prior year. 
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.5 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015. 
We forecast GAAP EPS between $6.90 and $7.50 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general, or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

We knew at the time we acquired it that we might have to make some changes in leadership. Christa has done an awesome job. The team hit all of its Q4 KPIs, and these are all about how do we get medium- to long-term momentum. We are currently primarily in the United States, but we also have operations in Japan, the U.K., Germany. We've made an acquisition with AS Digital to put us into Australia. There are also, by the way, a number of restaurants that use OpenTable software all around the world, although we may not have a consumer-facing site. The whole process of globalizing OpenTable has been -- you see recently their latest app update allows Americans to book in London. You'd think that was the simplest thing and that should have been done years ago, but there you go, it's done now. And this allows the app to become global. There's more things around languages as well. So if you go to book a restaurant in Germany and you're from the United States, you'll be able to see the menu and the product in English. And that's the kind of work that's going on. And as that replatforming gets done, and we expect that work to be done in this year, then we have some amazing tools to be able to offer, both the software proposition to restaurants as well as the demand proposition. You'll see on Booking.com, for instance, if you search New York, we've got a beautiful little ad there that says, hey, book a restaurant in New York through OpenTable. Those things we found to be positive experiments. So that's where we are. I'm optimistic. I think ultimately, there is a traveler network effect. Our restaurants are a more local business than, say, hotel staying, of course. But on the other hand, transient travelers are extremely valuable to restaurants. I mean, filling those last few tables can often be the difference between making money and not making money. And they realize that those travelers have choice, and they're relatively not near as informed as maybe local people. And we think that's a valuable business, and we're seeing good results so far, but there's still a lot more work to do."

And we talked about the 22.6 million rooms we have on our website. In Europe, we're actually still adding a lot of properties, but because this is our most mature market, those properties are becoming smaller and smaller. By the way, they're still tremendously valuable because all of these smaller properties add tremendous diversity to our accommodation base, therefore being able to fit very specific needs. They also help us in low availability times. If there's a conference or something, these properties can help fill demand when you're in a supply-constrained environment. So Europe has a lot of properties in -- that are getting smaller and smaller. And that's the nature of the European business. And for instance, in Italy, at a time, we were adding 100 properties a day because these are very small properties in small places, kind of mom-and-pop operated-type product. In other parts of the world, we're still adding many large multiroom. I think India and China in particular. China, we've gone -- entered the year with about 6,500 properties, exited the year with 35,000 properties. A lot of that was organically built. In China, we have a lot more to do just adding really large hotels and properties. The challenge in China is making sure you have enough domestic demand to fill those. Inbound China is not a huge market, but domestic China is a huge market, and we're filling those beds through partnerships within China, including our relationship with Ctrip. India is another one that has -- that seems to have unending potential for us, and we're busy there building out that marketplace. I'd say another part of the world is Africa, Central America. These are areas still where we're adding hotels. But at some point, we will have most of the world's hotels, and then there's still a lot of extra property count in these single-owner, single apartment-type product, almost endless to some degree, it seems. But we're having to add those a room/property at a time, and that's obviously important and tough work."

There's -- one is in the absolute level of a currency, and the other issue is volatility. And a lower euro has a big impact, but it's also the movement in the euro because people need to get used to the fact that the euro is now $1.11 and no longer $1.35. So we certainly see, now that the euro is stabilized, that that's had a positive impact on year-over-year base of Europeans starting to travel back to America, starting to travel to the U.K., starting to travel to higher-currency zones. I think the other point that Dan made, the KAYAK data that shows that flights are down 15% year-over-year, that actually plays into the travel budget as well. So we're seeing more positive flows for -- of Europeans into these higher-currency markets. It certainly hasn't recovered to the time of the $1.35 euro, but it's more positive than it was a year ago. That said, intra-EU travel is still -- we're seeing very positive impacts there. There were -- there's a number of crises in the world, Tunisia, Egypt, even Turkey. The positive there for us is that many of these markets are wholesale kind of package travel markets. We have properties there, but they're traditionally sort of the Thomas Cooks, the TUIs of the world. And a lot of that travel is now ending up in Italy, in Spain and Southern France, and that's more of a retail market that plays also to our strength.

Off-line advertising, we're going to heavy up in periods where we think we've got good creative, and it's moving the needle for us. But over the long term, we expect that we would have leverage there, too. We'll hit a level of spending that we think is the right level in a market and both hit the number of markets that we think we should be in, and then our business should continue to grow faster than our spend would. So then the biggest expense is also the biggest variable, and that's the online advertising. We're very pleased with what we've seen with the efficiency over the last couple of quarters, but we've had 3 years before that of seeing pressure on that metric and pressure on ROIs year-over-year. And so it's difficult to predict what will happen there for the future. I have great confidence that we are probably better positioned than anybody else in the market, with the most choices to try and convert that paid traffic into a booking on the best websites, the best converting websites from a desktop and mobile perspective, with the most clever advertising teams really tailoring our bidding approach and using best-in-class tools to make sure that we spend our money efficiently.

So we -- our sites primarily -- have primarily been targeted at leisure, and over time, we've seen more customers come in for business purposes. And that's when we started to make some changes to our site and see if we could get positive conversion, and that seemed to work. So now you can go on our site and say, ""Am I traveling for leisure or business?"" And if you pick business, we highlight things important to businesspeople, and they seem to like that. And we've also discovered that about 20% of our business is business bookings versus leisure bookings. And the thesis, of course, is that -- nobody really knows, but maybe half of travel is business. It could be more or less than that, but that points to a pretty big opportunity if we serve that customer well. So then secondly, we built a very simple tool that allows the systems to book for businesspeople. It allows you to track budgets. It allows a manager to track where all their people are from a care-of-duty perspective. And now we're also optimizing that tool. We are seeing that our business bookings are growing faster than our leisure bookings, which means they're taking share on the site. That's what we want to see, but it's a process of optimization and investment. And obviously, if you just think of the sheer size of the numbers of going from 20% to 50%, for instance, that's a huge opportunity. But we're approaching it in a very typical Booking.com-Priceline Group way, which is many small steps, lots of optimization. And we're feeling positive. I think it will be one of those things that continues to contribute. There's no massive revolutionary move but more an evolutionary optimization, and today, feeling great about the progress but a lot more to do. Your second question, China outbound, some of it is hard to pick through when -- because of Chinese New Year, which is such a big holiday. And you guys have seen the pictures on the Internet and the train stations full of hundreds of thousands of people. It was another great Chinese New Year, but the real question is where do things swing out? We did see, let's say, a little bit of softness. Now but China softness is all relative. It's still a fast-growing market, but a little bit of softness in outbound in kind of Q3, Q4, a strong Chinese New Year, and then we have to see from there where it goes. Obviously, the situation in China and the headlines can also rattle travelers. We haven't seen any large material effect. And I also believe our long-term thesis around China certainly hasn't changed. They are the world's largest outbound travelers, and we're going to continue to try to take a bigger share of that business going forward."

Yes, well, as you point out, I mean, depending on what you call a chain, we -- about 10% to 15% of our business is a combination of global and regional chains, and we're always in contract negotiations with the chains. In fact, our take rate is quite stable. With many chains, we never had last room availability. But over time, they've given us more availability partly because it's good business. We bring in a transient traveler. Very few of our travelers stay at the same hotel twice. And this is valuable business because it's incremental. I think what you're seeing is discomfort with maybe the way the world is changing, but you should know our relationships are quite tight. There's also a difference between the chain and the owner of the hotel. I mean, the owner of the hotel wants more of this kind of business, and most of them want to lean into our model. For me, the average chain hotel only gets about half of the business that should be coming to us, partly because of all of these restrictions that are put on it. But many chain owners are also agitating to make sure they get their fair share because the business they're not getting is either going to another chain or it's going to an independent hotel. So yes, I don't appreciate some of the actions that they have taken at the chain level at times, but our relationships on a day-to-day basis are actually quite constructive and cordial, and our chain business is actually quite healthy. They have great product. Our customers want the product. But most of our customers, when they come to Washington, D.C., for instance, they're not looking for the Hilton or the Marriott in Washington. They're looking for a great bed in Washington. And our ranking system presents to them business that's well priced. And if the product is not well priced or it's not available, it's not going to convert, and therefore, it won't be presented to the customer. That's basically the way it works, and I'm always hopeful we can work through many of these issues when they arise."

That's the way our entire business works. And -- but if you look at our take rate in vacation rentals, where we are charging the vacation rental owner, and HomeAway or Airbnb will charge a lot to the consumer, the takes rates are actually quite equivalent when you look at the total take rate. I think anyone would rather charge to the owner, but if you don't have an instantly verifiable deal, then you might be worried if the owner's going to say, well, the person never showed up or he didn't stay or we didn't close the transaction. So we're actually in an enviable position to be able to do it the way we do. Obviously, I don't think I ever met a consumer who likes to pay fees, and we're betting that consumers won't want to pay fees. But more importantly, what we're trying to do is make booking a vacation rental or a home or an apartment as easy as booking a hotel room with the same level of trust, with the same feeling like you're going to get what you pay for. There's no post-negotiation on price, which happens sometimes on a non-request model. There's no post-negotiation, maybe, I want you to stay or, oh, actually, my room's not available now. And I believe that's where the model will ultimately end up. Getting from where we are today to where we need to, there's certainly still a lot of friction. But we're finding pretty positive response to this model, and it also, I think, is a nice way to set expectations with both the booker and the place that they're booking. And so we're sticking with that model. It seems to be working for us. But still, a lot of work to do, but we're playing a sort of a long game here that I think that more experience-centric, friction-free models are the future versus what -- how the business is being done today."

I don't feel like there's really anything to explain there, so I feel good with the quarter that we delivered despite the impact. For Easter, we don't have a number there either. I mean, there's a lot of travel that happens right around Easter, and we expect that, that will move from Q2 last year into Q1. But there are other breaks that people get that are just kind of around the time of Easter or, I know from my kids, their break is still going to be in April this year. So I don't know that we could precisely quantify for you the exact impact there, but it is beneficial to revenue in Q1. It will be a little bit of a detriment to revenue in Q2. From a gross profit perspective -- sorry, gross bookings perspective, it's probably a little bit negative to Q1 in that during that period where people are traveling, the bookings really drop off to a lower level because they're not booking while they're traveling. So that is the way to think about that in terms of gross bookings. And then summer comps, yes, it was a very strong summer season for us. It's too early to predict now. We're not giving guidance for summer, but we said in our prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about the macro travel environment right now and hope that will continue into the summer and, paired with lower fuel prices, lower airline ticket prices, hopefully mean some good tailwinds for summer travel."

So we're looking to generate as much business as we can at a reasonable ROI, and we didn't change anything that caused the trajectory of the business to change. That was consistent. And I think it's just amazing, the resilience of people, that even a horrific event like those attacks in Paris, in a relatively short amount of time, people became comfortable again with the idea of traveling. Paris still isn't back to where it was pre-attack for us and as a share of our business, but has bounced back from where it was. And so I think we benefit also from being a global player with so many different choices where people can travel to. But if they're not comfortable with a particular destination, they can find other places where they may feel more comfortable with traveling. So really, just the resilience would be the one thing that we'd point to that -- thank God, there were no additional attacks, and so the business bounced back."

Well, yes, on the -- on vacation rentals generally, and I would say self-catered products as well as what we call -- this includes apartments and homes and aparthotels, that's a -- that part of the market has traditionally had a lot more friction in it than the hotel booking side. And as that friction gets removed, you begin to see growth. Certainly, there's the sort of Airbnb effect of this being a new way to travel. But more importantly, for large groups, families booking a self-catered product or a home, it's actually a really good deal, the price-value equation looks great. But it's always had all kinds of fiction around, well, is it going to be there? Where does my money go? They want a deposit, et cetera, et cetera. And as we remove those points of friction, we're seeing good growth in that area.

Yes, it's still very early days, but we're happy with the way that TripAdvisor has fulfilled their side of the deal. The branding looks great. It seems to -- particularly, in the U.S. market where the early rollout has been, where the Booking.com brand is not as strong, I think that's helped us a lot. They're now rolling out in the markets maybe where we're stronger. Maybe it will help them a bit, where our brand might even be stronger than TripAdvisor's. But I think from a mutual perspective, it's been positive. There's a lot yet to optimize, but we sort of think about it as, wow, we've got an ad, and we have a performance tool to drive more business, and that's always a real positive thing for the company. I'm still, by the way, optimistic, still very supportive. And let's see where things end up as Steve and his team get to roll this product out to more markets."

Well, we haven't seen any major impact, but it's been a great experimental bed. And I think one of the biggest learnings, and I had mentioned this in the previous comment, is customers aren't going to overpay for a product. So if -- the properties are free to price the product the way they want to price it, but if it's overpriced, then it won't convert, and then they don't get any business. So in a way, the marketplace has this self-actualization to it regardless of what the rules are. We still believe parity is a very important construct. We think it, frankly, offers a lot of opportunity also for the properties to have a level playing field so that we're not using our margins to undercut them. But I'm now more comfortable with any regime that people realize if they want to get bookings on Booking, you have to have a well-priced product, and the marketplace deals with that. And if you don't, then nothing sells, conversion goes down, your ranking goes down, and then you don't get any business. So it's been interesting. All of our checks would say that parity in France is at least, if not more healthy than most of our markets in the world, and I think that's overall good news."

And then there's also developments at the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where they're looking to harmonize tax treatment across European Union. And one of the things that they're taking into consideration is these Innovation Box-type regimes, and they've talked about doing away with them sometime in 2021. So that's certainly risk out there. 2021 is still a long way away, and tax is subject to change, rates could change, and the OECD's interpretations could change.

I think first of all, it's important to understand how the ranking algorithm works. The primary driver helping with your rank is conversion, so it really is consumer interest. And you always have to be very careful in how you balance monetization with consumer interest because if you overweight on monetization, you can have really poor-quality results, and then no one wants to come to your website. So at least the way we've done it in the past is we have standard hotels and preferred hotels, and preferred hotels are only allowed to become preferred if they meet a number of experience criteria. And then they pay us a slightly higher commission and can often as much as double their bookings by being preferred. That's been our primary driver. The second one, we do allow some overrides. They're not used broadly, but a hotel can pay us even more commission if they want, say, it's a new hotel, they don't have a lot of reviews or something, to try and get a slightly higher ranking. But it never -- we never allow them ultimately to buy the very top of the ranking from the very bottom. It doesn't work that way. So we feel comfortable with the model that we have. I think it's a very -- like in any auction site, you have to really be careful with the dials because you think you might win in monetization, but if you crap up the product, then you're not going to have any customers.

I am joined today by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan in our Norwalk office before the market up opens this morning in New York.
The group performed well in the quarter and we make good progress executing against our key initiatives. The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $16.7 billion, up about 26% on a constant-currency basis or about 21% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 21% -- or about 27% in a constant-currency basis an adjusted EBITDA was also up 27% to $676 million.  And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $10.54, up 30% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter.
GAAP earnings per share were $7.47, up 17% versus the prior year. Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again impacted by the strong dollar, but less than we had experienced in previous quarters.
Our customers booked accommodation reservations for $137 million room nights in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reflecting acceleration from the second consecutive quarter. We are pleased with this consistent robust growth in reservations, which reflects affects continued solid execution in the market for global travel. Booking.com continues to not only grow its accommodations supplies, but also increased its penetration within its supply base. Booking.com's platform now has approximately 900,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 220 countries and territories, up 31% over last year. 
This platform also includes 422,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties which grew 40% year-over-year. We believe this inventory of unique properties represents an important source of future growth for the business, particularly when we can offer with the best dynamic booking experience and great customer service.
While our core business remained strong, Booking.com continues to invest in the future through innovation. For example, providing a rich customer experience for customers early in the travel planning process. Bookings new passion search is a unique search tool that helps our customers find and experience their true passions with rich content and an elegant interface.
We also remained focused and committed to helping our business customers with their unique travel needs. Booking.com for Business had another successful quarter in extending its services from individual business travelers to small and medium-sized businesses. We are seeing solid growth in business bookers, and Booking.com will continue to innovate and develop new tools to help these customers travel more easily and efficiently.
Priceline.com's results continued to be impacted by a pressure on its opaque business due to greater marketplace competition in hotel discounting. Substantial investment in technology and people are underway to drive improvements to product, user interface and experiment velocity, and a new brand campaign launch in the first quarter aims at a more broadly appealing message and brand promise. 
Cost discipline contributed to the bottom line quarter for Agoda. As they pushed their pace of experimentation and innovation, they are positioning the platform for continued expansion. As mobility remains critically important across all of Agoda's primarily Asian markets it, we are pleased to note that the share of mobile transactions on Agoda is amongst some of the highest of the group's travel businesses.
KAYAK finish the quarter posting solid growth in queries, revenue and profit. Like over other bands in the pace of experimentation and innovation remains fast. Development around core search processing and functionality, mobile enhancements and new products all advanced during the quarter. We made -- we remained convinced that KAYAK's product breadth will continue to differentiate their services in the marketplace.
Turning to our rental car services. Rental Beyers grew year-over-year for the group. The largest contributor of this total, rentalcars.com, executed another solid quarter despite challenges in some of its largest markets. OpenTable had a good quarter in its core U.S. business, and continued adding restaurants to its cloud-based solution. OpenTable continues to make progress developing its technology platform for scaled international expansion and working with companies in the group to test cross-promotion opportunities.
In summary, the group had a strong fourth quarter led by its international Hotel business. But among results were aided by an early Easter and a shifted brand marketing expense from Q1 to Q2. The second quarter will be negatively affected by the seasonal Easter shifts and by year-over-year increases in branded performance-based marketing that represent important investments in building the business and our brands but will pressure operating leverage in the quarter, as you can see from our guidance. 
We do not believe that the higher expenses associated with the launch of new brand campaign's in the second quarter necessarily represents the long term run rate for the business. Our outlook is also forecasting weakness in hotel average daily rates, which is representative of volatility and macro market conditions.
Finally, while the circumstances of my return to the business as interim CEO are unfortunate, I'm looking forward to working with our talented brand leadership, including Gillian Tans, who I congratulate on her promotion to CEO of Booking.com; as we continue moving our business forward. We believe the business is well positioned to build on its long record of solid financial performance.
I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 was an exceptionally strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with acceleration in room night growth to 31% compared to 27% in Q4. We also had solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all demand channels and a key geographic regions. Rental car days grew by 11% in Q1, consistent with the Q4 growth rate. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 were down slightly versus prior year on a constant-currency basis for the consolidated group, which was below our forecast that ADRs would be up to about. Foreign exchange rates again presented a headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar. Our Q1 gross bookings grew by 21% expressed in U.S. dollars but grew by about 26% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. 
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and by about 27% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year.
Gross profit growth was helped by Easter falling in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year. We estimate that the early Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would've been recognized in Q2, if Easter fell in Q2 as it did last year.  The timing shift benefits our Q1 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins -- and we'll observe pressure on those metrics in Q2 in both cases compared to the prior year. 
Our gross profit take rate representing them commission, or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites, continues to be stable as it has been for quite some time now.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.7 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 31% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $296 million, which represented 7% growth versus prior year.
Growth versus prior year Q1 is negatively impacted by a favorable travel transaction Tax Court ruling in the amount of $16.4 million, included in Q1 2015 gross profit. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 21% in Q1 compared to the prior year.
Operating income grew by 27%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 28%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance and increased by 152 bps compared to Q1 last year. Operating margins for Q1 2016 compared to prior year Q1 were favorably impacted by the aforementioned Easter timing and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2. 
Solid ROIs for performance marketing were better than our guidance forecast. As highlighted in more detail in our soon to be filed 10-Q, in Q1, we changed from presenting online and off-line advertising to performance advertising and brand advertising. As a result, brand advertising done in online channels, such as YouTube and Facebook and display advertising, is now  combined with off-line advertising, and presented as brand advertising. We think the new presentation is helpful to investors as it distinguishes between performance marketing that is typically managed on an ROI basis, and brand advertising which is typically managed through a planned level of spend.
Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast, and generated margin leverage compared to prior year, in part due to gross profit benefit of earlier Easter this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $676 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $620 million and grew by 27% versus prior year. 
Net income increased by 12%, and fully diluted EPS by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 24%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 30%, including increased interest expense from our 2015 bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
GAAP net income in Q1 includes a noncash charge in the amount of $50.4 million related to another than temporary impairment and the value of our cost method investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil.
We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not driven by core operating results, and renders comparison to prior periods less meaningful.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $344 million of cash from operations during the first quarter 2016, which is about 65% above last year. We used our cash during the quarter to repurchase 202,000 [ph] shares of our common stock for $259 million. CapEx amounted to $53 million. 
Our cash and investments amounted to about $11 billion at March 31, 2016, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q2 guidance. Gross bookings have continued to grow strongly across all channels and key geographic regions thus far in Q2, but growth has decelerated compared to Q1. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate further as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. In addition, we believe that the euro cop and earlier timing this year for Ramadan will negatively impact our year-over-year growth rate in June.
Our Q2 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will not be significantly impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This is the first quarter in quite a while where FX is not expected to be a headwind. For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 15% to 22%, and total gross bookings to grow by 11% to 18% in U.S. dollars and on a constant-currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior-year period. Our forecast for decreasing ADRs relates to the shifts and the geographic mix of our business, ADR weakness in markets experiencing soft demands due to traveler safety concerns and the impact on demand of economic weakness in certain international markets.  Not surprisingly, these conditions have also resulted in elevated cancellation rates. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 7% to 14%. We expect gross profit to grow by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars and on a constant-currency basis.
The difference between forecasted gross bookings and gross profit growth relates to the lag between the timing of reservation booking and travel. A meaningful portion of the bookings recorded in Q2 are expected to benefit our gross profit in Q3 when summer travel takes place.
We expect about 575 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. Almost half of the margin pressure is due to the shift of Easter gross profit into Q1 and significantly increased brand advertising associated with the launch of new ad campaigns.
Consistent with prior years, operating leverage is also pressured by investments in non-ad OpEx for our accommodation reservation business to be ready for peak travel season and future growth. Although we occasionally experienced periods of lumpiness in the growth of brand advertising and non-advertising OpEx investments which come pressure margins as our guidance assumes for Q2, we expect over the longer term, have operating leverage in these 2 expense categories.
Finally, margins will also impacted by our assumptions for performance advertising efficiency. Our performance advertising return on investment has been solid thus far in the quarter but as usual, our forecast assumes deterioration from current levels, and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $740 million and $795 million, which is the midpoint is down 5% [ph] versus prior year. 
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.60 to $12.50 per share, which at the midpoint is down 3% versus prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015 and Q1 2016.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.35 and $10.25 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market, in particular.
We will now take your questions."

Europe growing a little bit slower but still posting really solid growth rates. So the shift in mix amongst regions has been pretty gradual. The impact of Euro cop has been -- we've seen then in the past as well and typically, what happens, it's the last 2 weeks of June, the first 2 weeks of July. So at the outset, when all the team are still playing, people are paying attention to the tournament and not necessarily booking travel as their teams get knocked out and the tournament wraps up, typically people will then book their summer vacation. They're the not going to forgo their vacation, but they may impact the timing of when they book it. And in terms of Ramadan, we've seen impacts every year. We have a big business in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region. It moves 10 days earlier. And so this year, we have 10 extra days in the month of June. Typically, at the outset of Ramadan, we see a slowing in bookings, as Muslims are observing Ramadan. And then at the end of Ramadan, we see an uptick in travel, which is beneficial for our business, and that -- even July last year, will be in July again this year."

They're definitely helping deliver the kind of 31% year-over-year room night growth that we saw in the first quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we view this sector of the market as a very important source of growth for the business going forward.

When were asked a lot of questions last quarter about why are you growing so much faster, what are you doing differently? Did you figure something out?

And again, we have very profitable hotel business that allows us to make these kind of investments in marketing.

With respect to the market conditions, I think that we all have seen over the last year since the financial crisis, what has been essentially a very fragile economic recovery that's been characterized by periods of apparent strength, followed by periods of apparent weakness, whether it's driven by headline risk associated with sovereign debt crisis or other political considerations and more recently, oil prices. To me, some of the weakness that we're seeing is essentially consistent with the fragility of the economic situation that we've experienced over the long term. But as Dan mentioned, we have seen -- in the industry statistics at a minimum of deceleration of increasing average daily rates for hotels in a lot of markets around the world. And in our case, what we've seen is -- on a constant-currency basis, a reduction, a slight reduction in ADRs for the first time in a long time as well as, Dan also mentioned, increases in cancellations in certain markets.

In terms of online brands spend, that's something that has grown in brands around the group in the last couple of years. And it does provide the opportunity for different ways of measuring effectiveness and at least in our view in some cases, more effective ways to measure the effectiveness of your brand spend. So I'm actually very optimistic that moving of brand spend to those channels has the potential to help us drive better long-term returns on investment on our brand spending. But at this point in time, it's not being measured like performance-based advertising where you're looking at the same session unit economics device by cost per click kind of thing. It's just not those kind of measurements I don't want to represent that we are ultimately will be looking at it the same way. But I think it's a -- it bodes well for our ability to better manage our brand spending over time. With respect to -- from a higher level, the changes that we are seeing in the space, I think that I continue to be very impressed by the size and the scope of the opportunity that The Priceline Group and others in our space have in front of us. Year after year, a good execution is rewarded when demand goes to a new distribution channels. When you look at the importance of 2 businesses that you just mentioned in terms of sources of demand, YouTube and Facebook, and others are just -- it's an opportunity for companies that could execute quickly and well to diversify and build on their demand. I also continue to be impressed by how attractive the global nature of the business is and the scale that we've developed in and in particular, Booking.com has developed, that just gives us an opportunity in markets around the world to build really big businesses despite the turmoil that characterizes not only the world economy but the political situation around the world. And one thing that has impressed me about this business since I started running it as Chief Operating Officer, priceline.com in late 2000, is the resiliency of our businesses in the face of some of these challenges, which is not to say that we don't see the impact of terrorism or financial crisis. We absolutely see it. The economic cycles to affect our business, but the time after time after time, they recover quickly. And they build because of the very substantial tailwinds that we have -- benefiting us in terms of opening up this activity from off-line channels to online channels, the growth of economic activity and middle-class spending in emerging markets around the world and finally, the ability of our teams around the world to improve the edge we have in trying to drive demand in these channels. I hope that's responsive to your question."

But as we look at the share of the business that we're getting from major distribution channels, we feel very comfortable that we are holding or gaining share. When we look at what's happening in alternative accommodations and particularly, the growth that Airbnb is advertising in the marketplace, I personally think that represents an opportunity for us because we're in a position to build our business in that space, and to drive a very substantial demand to those properties, to convert them with an experience that's great for the customer and profitable for us.

With respect to branding and branding spend in the United States, I would start off by saying that we are very pleased with the progress that Booking.com has made in building its business and in building its brand in the United States. The -- from time to time, we've given some insight into what our overall growth rate is in the United States and we're not providing that color today. But I will say that we are pleased with the absolute and relative rates of growth of the Booking.com as a business here in the United States. We were very pleased with the results of the original brand launch on television of Booking.com in the United States, and saw a demonstrable impact in not just awareness but also the business and ultimately, the total cost that we experienced to drive customers as a whole were attracted to us. As to why brand spending versus performance-based marketing, in the United States, it's a different market than international markets. First of all, our competition has very substantial share of voice on television. And if you don't participate it, you are conceding awareness and ultimately demand to your competition. And when you think about the size of the U.S. market in terms of population and the travel market, and the fact that it's a homogenous market that you could advertise do with 1 campaign across the country, it really makes sense to have brand advertising here and I think that strategy is spot on. And as we said in our prepared remarks, having a push associated with a new campaign is not something that's going to happen every quarter of every year. But we think it's a solid and sound strategy to continue to build awareness for our brand which today preachers is available everywhere are under indexes in terms of awareness with other major travel brands in the space. In terms of OpenTable and their plans to expand internationally, I think I said in my prepared remarks that there's a technology job to do in terms of aggravations to their tent platform that make international expansion easy versus having to go to new platform in every different country. And that work is underway. And I think once it's completed, we'll be in a better position the essentially, build on the international footprint that we have as a group and helping OpenTable bring its product overseas. I'll mentioned that they've done some work in Australia on a preliminary basis to try to understand what the potential impact of that is. And while it's very small and very early days, we think it's showing us that this strategy is the right strategy to help build out the brand."

With respect to the major hotel chains, a couple of things to keep in mind. First is, and to say that at the outset that our relationships with hotels, in particular and with the hotel chains is an important part of who we are as a group that we have a tradition supplier friendliness of bringing demand to our hotel partners at very low distribution cost. And in particular, because of the international footprint of our business, we uniquely can provide access to demand around the world that even the most sophisticated chains cannot access themselves because they don't have the functionality, the language capabilities, or the distribution capabilities that we have on a global basis. So we're providing a little bit of a different and at least, in my judgment, more valuable service to our hotel partners really than anybody else in the space. With respect to their efforts to drive traffic directly to their website, it's understandable. There are -- they have a strong desire to strengthen their brands and we understand that. On the other hand, we believe our customers are entitled to competitive pricing and the best availability that is out there for intermediaries, because we provide the largest business to most of the hotels that we work with. So we tried to maintain that balance. I think people should keep in mind that the share of business that The Priceline Group has with the chains is relatively small. It's not like -- it used to be for Priceline, when that chains -- when U.S. business was such a major part of the whole, it's really a much smaller part of the business. And ultimately, for any hotel that wants to maximize the benefits they get from working with our brands, the most important things are going to be heir pricing, their content, their availability, the competitiveness of the offer that we can show to our customers."

And for priceline.com, it was a -- the strategic position to hold back a little bit on running the campaign until we were further along with the tech platform relaunch.

The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $16.7 billion, up about 26% on a constant-currency basis or about 21% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.  Gross profit was up 21%, or about 27% on a constant-currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA was also up 27% to $676 million.
And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $10.54, up 30% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. GAAP earnings per share were $7.47, up 17% versus the prior year. Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again impacted by the strong dollar, but less than we have experienced in previous quarters.
Our customers' booked accommodation reservations for 137 million room nights in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reflecting acceleration for the second consecutive quarter. We are pleased with this consistent robust growth in reservations, which reflects continued solid execution in the market for global travel. 
Booking.com continues to not only grow its accommodation supplies, but also increased its penetration within its supply base. Booking.com's platform now has approximately 900,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 220 countries and territories, up 31% over last year. This platform also includes 422,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 40% year-over-year. We believe this inventory of unique properties represents an important source of future growth for the business, particularly when we can offer it with the best dynamic booking experience and great customer service.
While our core business remained strong, Booking.com continues to invest in the future through innovation, for example, providing a rich customer experience for customers early in the travel planning process. Booking's new Passion Search is a unique search tool that helps our customers find and experience their true passions with rich content and an elegant interface.
We also remain focused and committed to helping our business customers with their unique travel needs. Booking.com for Business had another successful quarter in extending its services from individual business travelers to small- and medium-sized businesses. We are seeing solid growth in business bookers, and Booking.com will continue to innovate and develop new tools to help these customers travel more easily and efficiently.
Priceline.com's results continued to be impacted by a pressure on its opaque business due to greater marketplace competition in hotel discounting. Substantial investment in technology and people are underway to drive improvements to product, user interface and experiment velocity, and a new brand campaign launch in the first quarter aims at a more broadly appealing message and brand promise. 
Cost discipline contributed to a good bottom line quarter for Agoda. As they pushed their pace of experimentation and innovation, they are positioning the platform for continued expansion. As mobility remains critically important across all of Agoda's primary Asian markets, we are pleased to note that the share of mobile transactions on Agoda is among the highest of the group's travel businesses.
KAYAK finished the quarter posting solid growth in queries, revenue and profit. Like our other brands, the pace of experimentation and innovation remains fast. Development around core search processing and functionality, mobile enhancements and new products all advanced during the quarter. We made -- we remain convinced that KAYAK's product breadth will continue to differentiate their services in the marketplace.
Turning to our rental car services. Rental car days grew 11% year-over-year for the group. The largest contributor of this total, rentalcars.com, executed another solid quarter despite challenges in some of its largest markets.
OpenTable had a good quarter in its core U.S. business and continued adding restaurants to its cloud-based solution. OpenTable continues to make progress developing its technology platform for scaled international expansion and working with companies in the group to test cross-promotion opportunities.
In summary, the group had a strong first quarter, led by its international hotel business. Bottom line results were aided by an early Easter and a shifted brand marketing expense from Q1 to Q2. The second quarter will be negatively affected by the seasonal Easter shift and by year-over-year increases in brand and performance-based marketing that represent important investments in building the business and our brands, but will pressure operating leverage in the quarter, as you can see from our guidance. 
We do not believe that the higher expenses associated with the launch of new brand campaigns in the second quarter necessarily represents the long-term run rate for the business. Our outlook is also forecasting weakness in hotel average daily rates, which is representative of volatility and macro market conditions.
Finally, while the circumstances of my return to the business as interim CEO are unfortunate, I'm looking forward to working with our talented brand leadership, including Gillian Tans, who I congratulate on her promotion to CEO of Booking.com, as we continue moving our business forward. We believe the business is well positioned to build on its long record of solid financial performance.
I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,330886138,972071,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016.

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 was an exceptionally strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with acceleration in room night growth to 31% compared to 27% in Q4. We also had solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all demand channels and key geographic regions.
Rental car days grew by 11% in Q1, consistent with the Q4 growth rate. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 were down slightly versus prior year on a constant-currency basis for the consolidated group, which was below our forecast that ADRs would be up by about 1%.
Foreign exchange rates again presented a headwind to our growth rate expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar. Our Q1 gross bookings grew by 21% expressed in U.S. dollars, but grew by about 26% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. 
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and by about 27% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year. Gross profit growth was helped by Easter falling in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year. We estimate that the early Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would have been recognized in Q2 if Easter fell in Q2, as it did last year. The timing shift benefits our Q1 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins and will exert pressure on those metrics in Q2 in both cases compared to the prior year. 
Our gross profit take rate, representing the amount we earn in commission or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites, continues to be stable as it has been for quite some time now.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.7 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 31% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $296 million, which represented 7% growth versus prior year.
Growth versus prior year Q1 is negatively impacted by a favorable travel transaction tax court ruling in the amount of $16.4 million included in Q1 2015 gross profit. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 21% in Q1 compared to the prior year.
Operating income grew by 27%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 28%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance and increased by 152 bps compared to Q1 last year. Operating margins for Q1 2016 compared to the prior year Q1 were favorably impacted by the aforementioned Easter timing and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2. 
Solid ROIs for performance marketing were better than our guidance forecast. As highlighted in more detail in our soon-to-be-filed 10-Q, in Q1, we changed from presenting online and off-line advertising to performance advertising and brand advertising. As a result, brand advertising done in online channels, such as YouTube and Facebook and display advertising, is now combined with off-line advertising and presented as brand advertising. We think the new presentation is helpful to investors as it distinguishes between performance marketing that is typically managed on an ROI basis; and brand advertising, which is typically managed through a planned level of spend.
Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and generated margin leverage compared to prior year, in part, due to the gross profit benefit of earlier Easter this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $676 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $620 million, and grew by 27% versus prior year. 
Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 24%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 30%, including increased interest expense from our 2015 bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
GAAP net income in Q1 includes a noncash charge in the amount of $50.4 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of our cost-method investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil.
We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because this is not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $344 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2016, which is about 65% above last year. We used our cash during the quarter to repurchase 202,000 shares of our common stock for $259 million. CapEx amounted to $53 million. Our cash and investments amounted to about $11 billion at March 31, 2016, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q2 guidance. Gross bookings have continued to grow strongly across all channels and key geographic regions thus far in Q2, but growth has decelerated compared to Q1. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate further as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. In addition, we believe that the Euro Cup and earlier timing this year for Ramadan will negatively impact our year-over-year growth rate in June.
Our Q2 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will not be significantly impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This is the first quarter in quite a while where FX is not expected to be a headwind.
For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 15% to 22% and total gross bookings to grow by 11% to 18% in U.S. dollars and on a constant-currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior year period. Our forecast for decreasing ADRs relates to the shifts and the geographic mix of our business, ADR weakness in markets experiencing soft demands due to traveler safety concerns and the impact on demand of economic weakness in certain international markets. Not surprisingly, these conditions have also resulted in elevated cancellation rates.
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 7% to 14%. We expect gross profit to grow by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars and on a constant-currency basis. The difference between forecasted gross bookings and gross profit growth relates to the lag between the timing of reservation booking and travel. A meaningful portion of the bookings recorded in Q2 are expected to benefit our gross profit in Q3 when summer travel takes place.
We expect about 575 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. Almost half of the margin pressure is due to the shift of Easter gross profit into Q1 and significantly increased brand advertising associated with the launch of new ad campaigns.
Consistent with prior years, operating leverage is also pressured by investments in non-ad OpEx for our accommodation reservation business to be ready for peak travel season and future growth. Although we occasionally experienced periods of lumpiness in the growth of brand advertising and non-advertising OpEx investments, which can pressure margins as our guidance assumes for Q2, we expect over the longer term to have operating leverage in these 2 expense categories.
Finally, margins will be also impacted by our assumptions for performance advertising efficiency. Our performance advertising return on investment has been solid thus far in the quarter, but as usual, our forecast assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $740 million and $795 million, which, at the midpoint, is down 5% versus prior year. 
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.60 to $12.50 per share, which, at the midpoint, is down 3% versus prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015 and Q1 2016.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.35 and $10.25 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

And that's been the case for quite a while now. So we've got regions, other than Europe, growing faster than our consolidated growth rate, typically. Europe growing a little bit slower, but still posting really solid growth rates. So the shift in mix amongst regions has been pretty gradual. The impact of Euro Cup has been -- we've seen that in the past as well and typically, what happens, it's the last 2 weeks of June, the first 2 weeks of July. So at the outset, when all the teams are still playing, people are paying attention to the tournament and not necessarily booking travel. As their teams get knocked out and the tournament wraps up, typically, people will then book their summer vacation. They're not going to forgo their vacation, but it may impact the timing of when they book it. And in terms of Ramadan, we've seen impacts every year. We have a big business in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region. It moves 10 days earlier. And so this year, we have 10 extra days in the month of June. Typically, at the outset of Ramadan, we see a slowing in bookings as Muslims are observing Ramadan. And then at the end of Ramadan, we see an uptick in travel, which is beneficial for our business, and that is in July last year, and it will be in July again this year."

They are definitely helping deliver the kind of 31% year-over-year room night growth that we saw in the first quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we view this sector of the market as a very important source of growth for the business going forward.

When we were asked a lot of questions last quarter about, ""Why are you growing so much faster? What are you doing differently? Did you figure something out?"" We said the good news was no, we think they were just continuing to perform well and the market is healthy. I think that's also the case with what we're seeing now in Q2.

And as you know, we have a very strong culture of metric-driven management, so you can expect us to look very carefully at the returns on the brand investments to make sure that it's paying off in terms of strengthening our brand and driving traffic to the website. With respect to the market conditions, I think that we all have seen, over the last year since the financial crisis, what has been essentially a very fragile economic recovery that's been characterized by periods of apparent strength, followed by periods of apparent weakness, whether it's driven by headline risk associated with sovereign debt crisis or other political considerations and more recently, oil prices. To me, some of the weakness that we're seeing is essentially consistent with the fragility of the economic situation that we've experienced over the long term. But as Dan mentioned, we have seen in the industry statistics at a minimum deceleration of increasing average daily rates for hotels in a lot of markets around the world. And in our case, what we've seen is, on a constant-currency basis, a reduction, a slight reduction in ADRs for the first time in a long time as well as, Dan also mentioned, increases in cancellations in certain markets. And so we wanted to flag that for investors as something that's a component of our forward-looking guidance for top line growth."

In terms of online brand spend, that's something that has grown in brands around the group in the last couple of years. And it does provide the opportunity for different ways of measuring effectiveness and, at least, in our view, in some cases, more effective ways to measure the effectiveness of your brand spend. So I'm actually very optimistic that, that moving of brand spend to those channels has the potential to help us drive better long-term returns on investment on our brand spending. But at this point in time, it's not being measured like performance-based advertising, where you're looking at the same-session unit economics divided by cost-per-click kind of thing. It's just not those kind of measurements, so I don't want to represent that we are -- or ultimately, we'll be looking at it the same way. But I think it's a -- it bodes well for our ability to better manage our brand spending over time. With respect to -- from a higher level, the changes that we're seeing in the space, I think that I continue to be very impressed by the size and the scope of the opportunity that The Priceline Group and others in our space have in front of us. Year-after-year, good execution is rewarded when demand goes to new distribution channels. When you look at the importance of 2 businesses that you just mentioned in terms of sources of demand, YouTube and Facebook and others are just -- it's an opportunity for companies that can execute quickly and well to diversify and build on their demand. I also continue to be impressed by how attractive the global nature of the businesses and the scale that we've developed and, in particular, Booking.com has developed, that just gives us an opportunity in markets around the world to build really big businesses despite the turmoil that characterizes not only the world economy, but the political situation around the world. And one thing that has impressed me about this business since I started running it as Chief Operating Officer of priceline.com in late 2000 is the resiliency of our businesses in the face of some of these challenges, which is not to say that we don't see the impact of terrorism or financial crisis. We absolutely see it. The economic cycles do affect our business, but time after time after time, they recover quickly. And they build because of the very substantial tailwinds that we have benefiting us in terms of opening up this activity from off-line channels to online channels; the growth of economic activity and middle-class spending in emerging markets around the world; and finally, the ability of our talented teams around the world to improve the edge we have in trying to drive demand in these channels. I hope that's responsive to your question."

But as we look at the share of the business that we're getting from major distribution channels, we feel very comfortable that we're holding or gaining share. When we look at what's happening in alternative accommodations and particularly, the growth that Airbnb is advertising in the marketplace, I personally think that represents an opportunity for us because we're in a position to build our business in that space and to drive very substantial demand to those properties, to convert them with an experience that's great for the customer and profitable for us.

Th",456,"Okay, thank you. With respect to branding and branding spend in the United States, I would start off by saying that we are very pleased with the progress that Booking.com has made in building its business and in building its brand in the United States. The -- from time to time, we've given some insight into what our overall growth rate is in the United States, and we're not providing that color today. But I will say that we are pleased with the absolute and relative rates of growth of Booking.com as a business here in the United States. We were very pleased with the results of the original brand launch on television of Booking.com in the United States and saw a demonstrable impact in terms of not just awareness, but also the business and ultimately, the total cost that we experienced to drive customers, as a whole, were attracted to us. As to why brand spending versus performance-based marketing, in the United States, it's a different market than international markets. First of all, our competition has very substantial share of voice on television. And if you don't participate, you are conceding awareness and ultimately, demand to your competition. And when you think about the size of the U.S. market in terms of population and the travel market, and the fact that it's a homogenous market that you can advertise to with one campaign across the country, it really makes sense to have brand advertising here, and I think that strategy is spot on. And as we said in our prepared remarks, having a push associated with a new campaign is not something that's going to happen every quarter of every year. But we think it's a solid and sound strategy to continue to build awareness for our brand, which, today, research is available everywhere under indexes in terms of awareness with other major travel brands in the space. In terms of OpenTable and their plans to expand internationally, I think I said in my prepared remarks that there's a technology job to do in terms of abbreviations to their tech platform that make international expansion easy versus having to build a new platform in every different country. And that work is underway. And I think once it's completed, we'll be in a better position to essentially build on the international footprint that we have as a group in helping OpenTable bring its product overseas. I'll mention that they've done some work in Australia on a preliminary basis to try to understand what the potential impact of that is. And while it's very small and very early days, we think it's showing us that this strategy is the right strategy to help build out the brand."

With respect to the major hotel chains, a couple of things to keep in mind. First is, to say at the outset that our relationships with hotels, in particular, and with the hotel chains, is an important part of who we are as a group that we've had a tradition of supplier friendliness of bringing demand to our hotel partners at very low distribution cost. And in particular, because of the international footprint of our business, we uniquely can provide access to demand around the world that even the most sophisticated chains cannot access themselves because they don't have the functionality, the language capabilities or the distribution capabilities that we have on a global basis. So we're providing a little bit of a different and at least, in my judgment, more valuable service to our hotel partners really than anybody else in the space. With respect to their efforts to drive traffic directly to their website, it's understandable. There -- they have a strong desire to strengthen their brands, and we understand that. On the other hand, we believe our customers are entitled to competitive pricing and the best availability that is out there for intermediaries because we provide the largest business to most of the hotels that we work with. So we try to maintain that balance. I think people should keep in mind that the share of business that The Priceline Group does with the chains is relatively small. It's not like -- it used to be for Priceline when the chains with the U.S. business was such a major part of the whole, it's really a much smaller part of the business. And ultimately, for any hotel that wants to maximize the benefit they get from working with our brands, the most important things are going to be their pricing, their content, their availability, the competitiveness of the offer that we can show to our customers."

And for priceline.com, it was a strategic position to hold back a little bit on running the campaign until we were further along with the tech platform relaunch.

I am joined today by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan, in our Norwalk office before the market opens this morning in New York.The group performed well in the",886,"Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's Second Quarter Conference Call. I am joined today by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan, in our Norwalk office before the market opens this morning in New York.
The group performed well in the quarter, and we made good progress executing against our key initiatives. The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $16.7 billion, up about 26% on a constant-currency basis or about 21% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.  Gross profit was up 21%, or about 27% on a constant-currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA was also up 27% to $676 million.
And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $10.54, up 30% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. GAAP earnings per share were $7.47, up 17% versus the prior year. Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again impacted by the strong dollar, but less than we have experienced in previous quarters.
Our customers' booked accommodation reservations for 137 million room nights in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reflecting acceleration for the second consecutive quarter. We are pleased with this consistent robust growth in reservations, which reflects continued solid execution in the market for global travel. 
Booking.com continues to not only grow its accommodation supply, but also increased its penetration within its supply base. Booking.com's platform now has approximately 900,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 220 countries and territories, up 31% over last year. This platform also includes 422,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 40% year-over-year. We believe this inventory of unique properties represents an important source of future growth for the business, particularly when we can offer it with the best dynamic booking experience and great customer service.
While our core business remains strong, Booking.com continues to invest in the future through innovation, for example, providing a rich customer experience for customers early in the travel planning process. Booking's new Passion Search is a unique search tool that helps our customers find and experience their true passions with rich content and an elegant interface.
We also remain focused and committed to helping our business customers with their unique travel needs. Booking.com for Business had another successful quarter in extending its services from individual business travelers to small- and medium-sized businesses. We are seeing solid growth in business bookers, and Booking.com will continue to innovate and develop new tools to help these customers travel more easily and efficiently.
Priceline.com's results continue to be impacted by pressure on its opaque business due to greater marketplace competition in hotel discounting. Substantial investment in technology and people are underway to drive improvements to product, user interface and experiment velocity, and a new brand campaign launched in the first quarter aims at a more broadly appealing message and brand promise. 
Cost discipline contributed to a good bottom line quarter for Agoda. As they push their pace of experimentation and innovation, they are positioning the platform for continued expansion. As mobility remains critically important across all of Agoda's primary Asian markets, we are pleased to note that the share of mobile transactions on Agoda is among the highest of the group's travel businesses.
KAYAK finished the quarter posting solid growth in queries, revenue and profit. Like our other brands, the pace of experimentation and innovation remains fast. Development around core search processing and functionality, mobile enhancements and new products all advanced during the quarter. We made -- we remain convinced that KAYAK's product breadth will continue to differentiate their services in the marketplace.
Turning to our rental car services. Rental car days grew 11% year-over-year for the group. The largest contributor of this total, rentalcars.com, executed another solid quarter despite challenges in some of its largest markets.
OpenTable had a good quarter in its core U.S. business and continued adding restaurants to its cloud-based solution. OpenTable continues to make progress developing its technology platform for scaled international expansion and working with companies in the group to test cross-promotion opportunities.
In summary, the group had a strong first quarter, led by its international hotel business. Bottom line results were aided by an early Easter and a shift of brand marketing expense from Q1 to Q2. The second quarter will be negatively affected by the seasonal Easter shift and by year-over-year increases in brand and performance-based marketing that represent important investments in building the business and our brands, but will pressure operating leverage in the quarter, as you can see from our guidance. 
We do not believe that the higher expenses associated with the launch of new brand campaigns in the second quarter necessarily represents the long-term run rate for the business. Our outlook is also forecasting weakness in hotel average daily rates, which is representative of volatility in macro market conditions.
Finally, while the circumstances of my return to the business as interim CEO are unfortunate, I'm looking forward to working with our talented brand leadership, including Gillian Tans, who I congratulate on her promotion to CEO of Booking.com, as we continue moving our business forward. We believe the business is well positioned to build on its long record of solid financial performance.
I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 was an exceptionally strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with acceleration in room night growth to 31% compared to 27% in Q4. We also had solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all demand channels and key geographic regions.
Rental car days grew by 11% in Q1, consistent with the Q4 growth rate. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 were down slightly versus prior year on a constant-currency basis for the consolidated group, which was below our forecast that ADRs would be up by about 1%.
Foreign exchange rates again presented a headwind to our growth rate expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar. Our Q1 gross bookings grew by 21% expressed in U.S. dollars, but grew by about 26% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. 
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and by about 27% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior year. Gross profit growth was helped by Easter falling in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year. We estimate that the early Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would have been recognized in Q2 if Easter fell in Q2, as it did last year. The timing shift benefits our Q1 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins and will exert pressure on those metrics in Q2 in both cases compared to the prior year. 
Our gross profit take rate, representing the amount we earn in commission or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites, continues to be stable as it has been for quite some time now.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.7 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 31% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $296 million, which represented 7% growth versus prior year.
Growth versus prior year Q1 is negatively impacted by a favorable travel transaction tax court ruling in the amount of $16.4 million included in Q1 2015 gross profit. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 21% in Q1 compared to the prior year.
Operating income grew by 27%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 28%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance and increased by 152 bps compared to Q1 last year. Operating margins for Q1 2016 compared to the prior year Q1 were favorably impacted by the aforementioned Easter timing and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2. 
Solid ROIs for performance marketing were better than our guidance forecast. As highlighted in more detail in our soon-to-be-filed 10-Q, in Q1, we changed from presenting online and off-line advertising to performance advertising and brand advertising. As a result, brand advertising done in online channels, such as YouTube and Facebook and display advertising, is now combined with off-line advertising and presented as brand advertising. We think the new presentation is helpful to investors as it distinguishes between performance marketing that is typically managed on an ROI basis; and brand advertising, which is typically managed to a planned level of spend.
Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and generated margin leverage compared to prior year, in part due to gross profit benefit of earlier Easter this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $676 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $620 million, and grew by 27% versus prior year. 
Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 24%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 30%, including increased interest expense from our 2015 bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
GAAP net income in Q1 includes a noncash charge in the amount of $50.4 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of our cost-method investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil.
We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because this is not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $344 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2016, which is about 65% above last year. We used our cash during the quarter to repurchase 202,000 shares of our common stock for $259 million. CapEx amounted to $53 million. Our cash and investments amounted to about $11 billion at March 31, 2016, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q2 guidance. Gross bookings have continued to grow strongly across all channels and key geographic regions thus far in Q2, but growth has decelerated compared to Q1. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate further as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. In addition, we believe that the Euro Cup and earlier timing this year for Ramadan will negatively impact our year-over-year growth rate in June.
Our Q2 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will not be significantly impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This is the first quarter in quite a while where FX is not expected to be a headwind.
For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 15% to 22% and total gross bookings to grow by 11% to 18% in U.S. dollars and on a constant-currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior year period. Our forecast for decreasing ADRs relates to the shifts in the geographic mix of our business, ADR weakness in markets experiencing soft demand due to traveler safety concerns and the impact on demand of economic weakness in certain international markets. Not surprisingly, these conditions have also resulted in elevated cancellation rates.
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 7% to 14%. We expect gross profit to grow by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars and on a constant-currency basis. The difference between forecasted gross bookings and gross profit growth relates to the lag between the timing of reservation booking and travel. A meaningful portion of the bookings recorded in Q2 are expected to benefit our gross profit in Q3 when summer travel takes place.
We expect about 575 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. Almost half of the margin pressure is due to the shift of Easter gross profit into Q1 and significantly increased brand advertising associated with the launch of new ad campaigns.
Consistent with prior years, operating leverage is also pressured by investments in non-ad OpEx for our accommodation reservation business to be ready for peak travel season and future growth. Although we occasionally experienced periods of lumpiness in the growth of brand advertising and non-advertising OpEx investments, which can pressure margins as our guidance assumes for Q2, we expect over the longer term to have operating leverage in these 2 expense categories.
Finally, margins will also be impacted by our assumptions for performance advertising efficiency. Our performance advertising return on investment has been solid thus far in the quarter, but as usual, our forecast assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $740 million and $795 million, which at the midpoint is down 5% versus prior year. 
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.60 to $12.50 per share, which at the midpoint is down 3% versus prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015 and Q1 2016.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.35 and $10.25 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

And that's been the case for quite a while now. So we've got regions other than Europe growing faster than our consolidated growth rate, typically. Europe growing a little bit slower, but still posting really solid growth rates. So the shift in mix amongst regions has been pretty gradual. The impact of Euro Cup has been -- we've seen that in the past as well and typically, what happens, it's the last 2 weeks of June, the first 2 weeks of July. So at the outset, when all the teams are still playing, people are paying attention to the tournament and not necessarily booking travel. As their teams get knocked out and the tournament wraps up, typically, people will then book their summer vacation. They're not going to forgo their vacation, but it may impact the timing of when they book it. And in terms of Ramadan, we've seen impacts every year. We have a big business in the Middle East and Asia Pacific region. It moves 10 days earlier. And so this year, we have 10 extra days in the month of June. Typically, at the outset of Ramadan, we see a slowing in bookings as Muslims are observing Ramadan. And then at the end of Ramadan, we see an uptick in travel, which is beneficial for our business, and that was in July last year, and it will be in July again this year."

The growth rates that we're seeing with respect to these properties are attractive. They are definitely helping deliver the kind of 31% year-over-year room night growth that we saw in the first quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we view this sector of the market as a very important source of growth for the business going forward. And our aim here, really, with respect to not just vacation properties, but other non-hotel accommodations, is to build the inventory substantially, provide a dynamic booking experience that is superior to any other alternative in the marketplace for these kinds of accommodations and a customer service and customer experience that is consistent with what we've been providing for customers for years and what's made us a leading player in the space.

And as we typically do, we assume that our growth will decelerate as we move through the quarter. We have the couple of external factors with Euro Cup and Ramadan that we're calling out for the month of June, which has caused us to build maybe a little bit more conservatism in, or I'll color that actually, is just reflect the fact that we think that's going to negatively impact our growth for that month."

So I think the ramp-up in spending for brand advertising, at least in this market, is consistent with demand trends. And again, we have a very profitable hotel business that allows us to make these kinds of investments in marketing. And as you know, we have a very strong culture of metric-driven management, so you can expect us to look very carefully at the returns on the brand investments to make sure that it's paying off in terms of strengthening our brand and driving traffic to the website. With respect to the market conditions, I think that we all have seen, over the last year since the financial crisis, what has been essentially a very fragile economic recovery that's been characterized by periods of apparent strength, followed by periods of apparent weakness, whether it's driven by headline risk associated with sovereign debt crisis or other political considerations and more recently, oil prices. To me, some of the weakness that we're seeing is essentially consistent with the fragility of the economic situation that we've experienced over the long term. But as Dan mentioned, we have seen in the industry statistics, at a minimum, a deceleration of increasing average daily rates for hotels in a lot of markets around the world. And in our case, what we've seen is, on a constant-currency basis, a reduction, a slight reduction in ADRs for the first time in a long time, as well as Dan also mentioned, increases in cancellations in certain markets. And so we wanted to flag that for investors as something that's a component of our forward-looking guidance for top line growth."

In terms of online brand spend, that's something that has grown in brands around the group in the last couple of years. And it does provide the opportunity for different ways of measuring effectiveness, and at least in our view, in some cases, more effective ways to measure the effectiveness of your brand spend. So I'm actually very optimistic that, that moving of brand spend to those channels has the potential to help us drive better long-term returns on investment on our brand spending. But at this point in time, it's not being measured like performance-based advertising, where you're looking at the same-session unit economics divided by cost-per-click kind of thing. It's just not those kind of measurements, so I don't want to represent that we are -- or ultimately, we'll be looking at it the same way. But I think it's a -- it bodes well for our ability to better manage our brand spending over time. With respect to -- from a higher level, the changes that we're seeing in the space, I think that I continue to be very impressed by the size and the scope of the opportunity that The Priceline Group and others in our space have in front of us. Year-after-year, good execution is rewarded when demand goes to new distribution channels. When you look at the importance of 2 businesses that you just mentioned in terms of sources of demand, YouTube and Facebook and others are just -- it's an opportunity for companies that can execute quickly and well to diversify and build on their demand. I also continue to be impressed by how attractive the global nature of the business is and the scale that we've developed, and in particular, Booking.com has developed, that just gives us an opportunity in markets around the world to build really big businesses despite the turmoil that characterizes not only the world economy, but the political situation around the world. And one thing that has impressed me about this business since I started running it as Chief Operating Officer of priceline.com in late 2000 is the resiliency of our businesses in the face of some of these challenges, which is not to say that we don't see the impact of terrorism or financial crisis. We absolutely see it. The economic cycles do affect our business, but time after time after time, they recover quickly. And they build because of the very substantial tailwinds that we have benefiting us in terms of movement of this activity from off-line channels to online channels; the growth of economic activity and middle-class spending in emerging markets around the world; and finally, the ability of our talented teams around the world to improve the edge we have in trying to drive demand in these channels. I hope that's responsive to your question."

With respect to branding and branding spend in the United States, I would start off by saying that we are very pleased with the progress that Booking.com has made in building its business and in building its brand in the United States. The -- from time to time, we've given some insight into what our overall growth rate is in the United States, and we're not providing that color today. But I will say that we are pleased with the absolute and relative rates of growth of the Booking.com business here in the United States. We were very pleased with the results of the original brand launch on television of Booking.com in the United States and saw a demonstrable impact in terms of not just awareness, but also the business and ultimately, the total cost that we experienced to drive customers, as a whole, were attractive to us. As to why brand spending versus performance-based marketing, in the United States, it's a different market than international markets. First of all, our competition has very substantial share of voice on television. And if you don't participate, you are conceding awareness and ultimately, demand to your competition. And when you think about the size of the U.S. market in terms of population and the travel market, and the fact that it's a homogenous market that you can advertise to with one campaign across the country, it really makes sense to have brand advertising here, and I think that strategy is spot on. And as we said in our prepared remarks, having a push associated with a new campaign is not something that's going to happen every quarter of every year. But we think it's a solid and sound strategy to continue to build awareness for our brand, which, today, research is available everywhere, under-indexes in terms of awareness with other major travel brands in the space. In terms of OpenTable and their plans to expand internationally, I think I said in my prepared remarks that there's a technology job to do in terms of revisions to their tech platform that make international expansion easy versus having to build a new platform in every different country. And that work is underway. And I think once it's completed, we'll be in a better position to essentially build on the international footprint that we have as a group in helping OpenTable bring its product overseas. I'll mention that they've done some work in Australia on a preliminary basis to try to understand what the potential impact of that is. And while it's very small and very early days, we think it's showing us that this strategy is the right strategy to help build out the brand."

With respect to the major hotel chains, a couple of things to keep in mind. First is, to say at the outset that our relationships with hotels in particular, and with the hotel chains, is an important part of who we are as a group, that we've had a tradition of supplier friendliness, of bringing demand to our hotel partners at very low distribution cost. And in particular, because of the international footprint of our business, we uniquely can provide access to demand around the world that even the most sophisticated chains cannot access themselves because they don't have the functionality, the language capabilities or the distribution capabilities that we have on a global basis. So we're providing a little bit of a different, and at least in my judgment, more valuable service to our hotel partners really than anybody else in the space. With respect to their efforts to drive traffic directly to their website, it's understandable. There -- they have a strong desire to strengthen their brands, and we understand that. On the other hand, we believe our customers are entitled to competitive pricing and the best availability that is out there for intermediaries, because we provide the largest business to most of the hotels that we work with. So we try to maintain that balance. I think people should keep in mind that the share of business that The Priceline Group does with the chains is relatively small. It's not like it used to be for Priceline when the chains for the U.S. business was such a major part of the whole, it's really a much smaller part of the business. And ultimately, for any hotel that wants to maximize the benefit they get from working with our brands, the most important things are going to be their pricing, their content, their availability, the competitiveness of the offer that we can show to our customers."

And for priceline.com, it was a strategic decision to hold back a little bit on running the campaign until we were further along with the tech platform relaunch.

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
I'm pleased to report that the group produced another solid quarter despite an often challenging market backdrop. Execution was consistent across the brands as we achieved several important milestones as a group. 
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $17.9 billion, up about 21% on a constant currency basis or about 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 16% or about 18% on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA increased to 8% to $867 million. Earnings per share were $11.60, up 17% versus the prior year. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $13.93, up 12% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. 
Our customers booked combination reservations for 141 million room nights in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with our reservation growth, considering the competitive nature of our markets as well as macro volatility in many travel markets experienced throughout the quarter. We believe the consistent growth we are reporting demonstrates the strength of our brands, the value of a diversified global footprint and solid execution by our brand management teams. 
Booking.com recorded another impressive quarter and we are excited to announce that we now have over 1 million properties on the Booking.com platform, which represents an increase of 30% over last year. The Booking team has nearly doubled the number of properties on its platform in just 2 years, a truly remarkable accomplishment that reflects the hard work and dedication that the Booking team employs on behalf of its customers and supply partners. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 493,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Our properties represent a combined total of approximately 23.7 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.3 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.3 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay. We believe the Booking.com has one of the largest platforms for vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties and offers the most customer friendly booking experience in the market. Booking.com also reached another milestone in the quarter as it surpassed over 1 million reservations booked in a single day on its website, an impressive measure that demonstrates the meaningful scale of our business. 
Agoda produced another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines as it continues to grow its global accommodation platform. The Asia-based Agoda team has built a world-class merchant supply platform, capable of amassing and serving a wide variety of private discount deals that has proven to be a great asset for the group. We are especially pleased to see group members leveraging the supply platform and availability for our customers. 
Consistent with the first quarter, KAYAK exceeded our expectations, posting strong growth in queries, revenue and profit. KAYAK continued its pace of innovation with the launch of several new products and enhancements, centered on new verticals, planning and travel tools and conversational travel services, such as KAYAK's Facebook Messenger service, an exciting new way to search and book travel experiences. 
Rental car days for the group grew 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com delivered a strong quarter and with its robust demand for its services across all of its major geographical regions. Rentalcars.com continues to make investments in expanding its global supply base as well as enhancements to its customer service organization. 
Priceline.com made good progress on its efforts to reposition the business, including strengthening the management team, building more sustainable marketing programs and designing improved product offerings and customer service, all in an effort to position the business for a strong start in 2017. 
OpenTable delivered good bottom line performance in the quarter, driven by a healthy balance of top line growth and cost efficiencies. OpenTable is working on attractive growth opportunities, increasing the size and scope of its restaurant footprint in North America, using innovation to drive greater diner frequency and pursuing growth in international markets. 
I am particularly excited about the pace with which our brand teams have built the business on mobile platforms. It is clear that progress in building share in the mobile channel is a critical component of delivering overall growth in the business. Product excellence, distribution and mobile marketing and monetization are all key components. You can see why this remains a top priority for all our brands. 
In summary, the group executed another solid quarter, focused by our brand leadership on controlling spending contributed to better-than-expected margins, underlining that a core strength of our business is control of operating expenses, which allows us to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while investing in future growth. 
We now turn our attention to the third quarter and our busy summer travel season. We feel good about our outlook for the third quarter, albeit in a global travel market that is certain to remain volatile due to economic uncertainty and the scourge of terrorism. All of our employees are intently focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience during this busy season. 
As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2016. 
All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q2 was solid quarter for The Priceline Group, with room night growth of 24% compared to 31% in Q1. Our growth did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast, resulting in room night and gross bookings performance that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. This momentum has carried over into Q3 as we will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. We were pleased with performance broadly across our key geographic regions. While recent terrorist attacks impacted gross bookings and cancellations in the markets affected, they did not have a significant discernible impact on our overall growth. Also, the Brexit vote caused a sizable devaluation in the British pound and create uncertainty for the U.K.'s economic outlook, but our exposure for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, to U.K. destination gross profit and U.K. source market gross bookings was 10% or less as a share of our business. 
Rental car days grew by 8% in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1. Average daily rates per accommodations, or ADRs, were down by less than 1% for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly favorable results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and our forecast. Our Q2 gross bookings grew by 19% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental gross bookings. 
Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.4 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. As I mentioned when we last reported in May, we estimate that earlier Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would've been recognized in Q2 as these [indiscernible] Q2 as we did last year. The timing shift negatively impacts our Q2 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins compared to the prior year. Gross profit grew at a slower pace than gross bookings in Q2, primarily due to the impact of the Easter timing and bookings recorded in Q2 that will benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel occurs, rather than due to any significant change in commission rates or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites. 
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.1 billion, which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $327 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year. 
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-inter-company revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 22% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Operating income grew by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6% and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance, but decreased by 315 bps compared to Q2 last year. Operating margins for Q2 2016 compared to prior year Q2 were pressured by the Easter timing I referred to earlier, performance advertising and facing a brand advertising shifting into Q2 from Q1. Performance advertising leverage was impacted by growth in paid marketing channels and growth in gross bookings that will partly benefit gross profit and subsequent quarters when travel takes place. 
Performance advertising ROIs were stable for the quarter, but were under year-over-year pressure towards the end of the quarter and thus far, in Q3 as we have left the comp last year when ROI started to improve. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to better than forecasted ROIs for performance marketing, trimming of brand advertising by our brand teams and less non-ad OpEx spending that assumed, partly due to facing shifting to Q3. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $867 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795 million and grew by 8% versus prior year. Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS grew by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 8% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 12%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. 
Net income also benefited from a lower effective tax rate in Q2 2016 due to the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in state tax law. GAAP net income in Q2 includes a non-cash charge in the amount of $12.9 million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of cost method investments, mainly related to the write off of our remaining investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance and funding needs of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil. We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not driven by our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1 billion of cash from operations during second quarter 2016, which is about 38% above last year. We repurchased 236,000 shares of our common stock for $299 million during the quarter, and we purchased an additional $69 million of our common stock after quarter closed in July. CapEx for the quarter amounted to $60 million. Our cash investments amounted to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2016, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q3 guidance. Q3 is off to a solid start, with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our Q3 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. I'll highlight that the basket of foreign currencies in which we transact weakened on a weighted average basis by about 2% versus the U.S. dollar since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts last updated their forecast. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 18% to 23% and total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes the constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 12% to 17%. We expect gross profit to grow by 15% to 20% in U.S. dollars and by 16% to 21% on a constant currency basis. We expect about 260 bps of deleverage on non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, principally really to our assumptions for performance advertising. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing on ROIs thus far in Q3 as compared to periods with improved ROI performance last year. Our forecast assumes further ROI deterioration over the balance of the quarter and provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.73 billion and $1.83 billion, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% versus prior year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $26.10 and $27.60 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $28.30 to $29.80 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up about 15% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.3 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made today. 
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the Euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. 
I would now like to outline some changes we will make in reporting non-GAAP financial metrics, which will be effective for guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward. First, our earnings releases and commentary in our earnings calls with respect to historical results will focus primarily on GAAP results. Second, we will continue to present adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, but will no longer deduct stock-based compensation, which, for us, is ranged between 2% and 3% of gross profit for the last few years. We will also discontinue adjusting for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and we will eventually sunset. We estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 after we change to our new approach will be approximately 17%. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice and we will provide information to assist investors in comparing our results from the fourth quarter on with prior periods on a consistent basis. 
We will now take your questions."

The China outbound market continues to be a market that is large and growing and that we all view has great potential because of the demographic factors that are well known affecting China. We have a number of different ways to participate in it. We participate in it through our partnership with Sea Trip, where our international hotels are shown to their customers and Booking.com and Agoda also participate directly in selling outbound to international travelers coming from China. I know there's been a lot written about a slowdown in overall economic growth in China, but we still view it as a very, very attractive market that will have substantial macro headwinds -- excuse me, tailwinds helping build both the middle-class and travel demand and we want to participate in it. With respect to alternative accommodations, as you can see by the numbers that we disclosed and sort of the ongoing property counts on Booking.com in particular, we have built a very large inventory of dynamically bookable non-hotel accommodations. And we view it as a growth opportunity for our brands and for Booking.com in particular, and most importantly, our customers have gotten used to having a world-class content and great experience, both in booking and at stay. And that's something that we're determined to deliver. With respect to alternative accommodations, we also have, I think, one of the best distribution networks. In other words, one of the best ways to market those properties of any player in the space and look forward to doing that. In terms of how those are presented on the website, that's something that's determined by technology and the experience we have with users on the website. There's always an opportunity to select those properties for customers who want to use the various filters that are available. So there's a lot of different ways to get to them. But the most fundamental element of it is that we are trying to show the particular customer what they're most likely looking for and that drives the presentation."

On the corporate travel opportunity, we always suspect that we had a substantial number of business users that were using our product, but we didn't until more recently have data on it, which is where that 1 in 5 number comes from. And that intuition gave us reason to look at the market more aggressively and try to build some functionality that would be targeted directly at corporate travelers. And so that 1 in 5 number represents the self-reported usage of our customers and what the opportunity is, is to build a business of business travelers using the tools that we provide for them and to try to get that share to go up. I wouldn't hazard, I guess, as to whether it would ultimately be 50-50. In the United States, the average hotel has 30% business traveler, 30% leisure traveler and 30% large groups for big hotels, so that gives you sort of a breakdown at least in the U.S. market as to what the market kind of looks like. But we think there's a great opportunity to build awareness among business travelers that Booking.com in particular is a great place to go and for business owners to use the tools that we're building, which we think will help us build share there. With respect to marketing efficiencies in newer markets, it's traditionally been the pattern that we have been willing to invest in marketing in new markets in order to build share and to build awareness of our brands until we got to a point where we'd achieved enough scale where the more normal ROI patterns would obtain. I don't have anything particular to report to you on that front. There may still be some markets where we're not long tenured and doing some investing in that would be very, very consistent with how we've run the business over the long term."

So with respect to the competitive environment and the Hotel Direct Book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites and they've done it over the years through driving single image pricing, through a very substantial investment in their own web experience and we look at the availability of different prices for their members on the website as an evolution of that effort. Our approach is to try to make sure that our customers have the best prices that are published and available, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of accomplishing that. And I think that given the scale of our business, we're in a position where it's a reasonable ask that the largest player in the space be able to show competitive prices to its customers. My belief is that those efforts will continue, and we'll continue to press to make sure that we've got competitive pricing. And I will say that if, over the long term, the efforts by the chains or others is essentially starting to drive consumers to expect to book only discounted prices rather than published retail prices, that the ultimate impact of that on hotel ADRs is probably not going to be great for the chains and companies like ours and other large competitors that are in the space. And the space are very well positioned to advertise substantial discounts as well. And so my comment there is, at some point, it might actually not be a great idea to push the market and push consumers into expecting to book only at discounted prices. On BookingSuite, the product continues to evolve. I think the team is excited about revenue management tools that are now being made available to customers and I think the customer interest and uptake on that has been good. Ultimately, having our engine drive direct bookings for small and medium-sized hotels, we still believe, is a good thing for the hotel because it allows them to participate in a channel that they were not participating in and help build their brand via a direct website that we can build for them and certainly provide the booking engine for and ultimately, it does help us because it provides us with excellent inventory and builds our relationship with the hotel, which is, over time, very important to us as well."

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
I'm pleased to report that the group produced another solid quarter despite an often challenging market backdrop. Execution was consistent across the brands as we achieved several important milestones as a group. 
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $17.9 billion, up about 21% on a constant currency basis or about 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 16% or about 18% on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA increased to 8% to $867 million. Earnings per share were $11.60, up 17% versus the prior year. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $13.93, up 12% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. 
Our customers booked combination reservations for 141 million room nights in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with our reservation growth, considering the competitive nature of our markets as well as macro volatility in many travel markets experienced throughout the quarter. We believe the consistent growth we are reporting demonstrates the strength of our brands, the value of a diversified global footprint and solid execution by our brand management teams. 
Booking.com recorded another impressive quarter and we are excited to announce that we now have over 1 million properties on the Booking.com platform, which represents an increase of 30% over last year. The Booking team has nearly doubled the number of properties on its platform in just 2 years, a truly remarkable accomplishment that reflects the hard work and dedication that the Booking team employs on behalf of its customers and supply partners. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 493,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Our properties represent a combined total of approximately 23.7 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.3 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.3 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay. We believe that Booking.com has one of the largest platforms for vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties and offers the most customer friendly booking experience in the market. Booking.com also reached another milestone in the quarter as it surpassed over 1 million reservations booked in a single day on its website, an impressive measure that demonstrates the meaningful scale of our business. 
Agoda produced another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines as it continues to grow its global accommodation platform. The Asia-based Agoda team has built a world-class merchant supply platform, capable of amassing and serving a wide variety of private discount deals that has proven to be a great asset for the group. We are especially pleased to see group members leveraging the supply platform and availability for our customers. 
Consistent with the first quarter, KAYAK exceeded our expectations, posting strong growth in queries, revenue and profit. KAYAK continued its pace of innovation with the launch of several new products and enhancements, centered on new verticals, planning and travel tools and conversational travel services, such as KAYAK's Facebook Messenger service, an exciting new way to search and book travel experiences. 
Rental car days for the group grew 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com delivered a strong quarter and with its robust demand for its services across all of its major geographical regions. Rentalcars.com continues to make investments in expanding its global supply base as well as enhancements to its customer service organization. 
Priceline.com made good progress on its efforts to reposition the business, including strengthening the management team, building more sustainable marketing programs and designing improved product offerings and customer service, all in an effort to position the business for a strong start in 2017. 
OpenTable delivered good bottom line performance in the quarter, driven by a healthy balance of top line growth and cost efficiencies. OpenTable is working on attractive growth opportunities, increasing the size and scope of its restaurant footprint in North America, using innovation to drive greater diner frequency and pursuing growth in international markets. 
I am particularly excited about the pace with which our brand teams have built the business on mobile platforms. It is clear that progress in building share in the mobile channel is a critical component of delivering overall growth in the business. Product excellence, distribution and mobile marketing and monetization are all key components. You can see why this remains a top priority for all our brands. 
In summary, the group executed another solid quarter, focused by our brand leadership on controlling spending contributed to better-than-expected margins, underlining that a core strength of our business is control of operating expenses, which allows us to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while investing in future growth. 
We've now turned our attention to the third quarter and our busy summer travel season. We feel good about our outlook for the third quarter, albeit in a global travel market that is certain to remain volatile due to economic uncertainty and the scourge of terrorism. All of our employees are intently focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience during this busy season. 
As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2016. 
All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q2 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group, with room night growth of 24% compared to 31% in Q1. Our growth did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast, resulting in room night and gross bookings performance that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. This momentum has carried over into Q3 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. We were pleased with performance broadly across our key geographic regions. While recent terrorist attacks impacted gross bookings and cancellations in the markets affected, they did not have a significant discernible impact on our overall growth. Also, the Brexit vote caused a sizable devaluation in the British pound and creates uncertainty for the U.K.'s economic outlook, but our exposure for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, to U.K. destination gross profit and U.K. source market gross bookings was 10% or less as a share of our business. 
Rental car days grew by 8% in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1. Average daily rates per accommodations, or ADRs, were down by less than 1% for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and our forecast. Our Q2 gross bookings grew by 19% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. 
Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.4 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. As I mentioned when we last reported in May, we estimate that earlier Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would've been recognized in Q2 if these fell in Q2 as it did last year. The timing shift negatively impacts our Q2 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins compared to the prior year. Gross profit grew at a slower pace than gross bookings in Q2, primarily due to the impact of the Easter timing and bookings recorded in Q2 that will benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel occurs, rather than due to any significant change in commission rates or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites. 
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.1 billion, which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $327 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year. 
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-inter-company revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 22% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Operating income grew by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6% and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance, but decreased by 315 bps compared to Q2 last year. Operating margins for Q2 2016 compared to prior year Q2 were pressured by the Easter timing I referred to earlier, performance advertising and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2 from Q1. Performance advertising leverage was impacted by growth in paid marketing channels and growth in gross bookings that will partly benefit gross profit and subsequent quarters when travel takes place. 
Performance advertising ROIs were stable for the quarter, but were under year-over-year pressure towards the end of the quarter and thus far, in Q3 as we have left the comp last year when ROI started to improve. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to better than forecasted ROIs for performance marketing, trimming of brand advertising by our brand teams and less non-ad OpEx spending that assumed, partly due to phasing shifting to Q3. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $867 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795 million and grew by 8% versus prior year. Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS grew by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 8% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 12%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. 
Net income also benefited from a lower effective tax rate in Q2 2016 due to the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in state tax law. GAAP net income in Q2 includes a non-cash charge in the amount of $12.9 million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of cost method investments, mainly related to the write off of our remaining investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance and funding needs of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil. We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not driven by our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1 billion of cash from operations during second quarter 2016, which is about 38% above last year. We repurchased 236,000 shares of our common stock for $299 million during the quarter, and we purchased an additional $69 million of our common stock after quarter closed in July. CapEx for the quarter amounted to $60 million. Our cash and investments amounted to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2016, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q3 guidance. Q3 is off to a solid start, with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our Q3 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. I'll highlight that the basket of foreign currencies in which we transact weakened on a weighted average basis by about 2% versus the U.S. dollar since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts last updated their forecast. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 18% to 23% and total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes the constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 12% to 17%. We expect gross profit to grow by 15% to 20% in U.S. dollars and by 16% to 21% on a constant currency basis. We expect about 260 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, principally related to our assumptions for performance advertising. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing pressure on ROIs thus far in Q3 as we compare to periods with improved ROI performance last year. Our forecast assumes further ROI deterioration over the balance of the quarter and provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.73 billion and $1.83 billion, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% versus prior year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $26.10 and $27.60 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $28.30 to $29.80 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up about 15% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.3 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date. 
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the Euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. 
I would now like to outline some changes we will make in reporting non-GAAP financial metrics, which will be effective for guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward. First, our earnings releases and commentary in our earnings calls with respect to historical results will focus primarily on GAAP results. Second, we will continue to present adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, but will no longer deduct stock-based compensation, which, for us, is ranged between 2% and 3% of gross profit for the last few years. We will also discontinue adjusting for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and we will eventually sunset. We estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 after we change to our new approach will be approximately 17%. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice and we will provide information to assist investors in comparing our results from the fourth quarter on with prior periods on a consistent basis. 
We will now take your questions."

The China outbound market continues to be a market that is large and growing and that we all view has great potential because of the demographic factors that are well known affecting China. We have a number of different ways to participate in it. We participate in it through our partnership with Ctrip, where our international hotels are shown to their customers and Booking.com and Agoda also participate directly in selling outbound to international travelers coming from China. I know there's been a lot written about a slowdown in overall economic growth in China, but we still view it as a very, very attractive market that will have substantial macro headwinds -- excuse me, tailwinds helping build both the middle-class and travel demand and we want to participate in it. With respect to alternative accommodations, as you can see by the numbers that we disclosed and sort of the ongoing property counts on Booking.com in particular, we have built a very large inventory of dynamically bookable non-hotel accommodations. And we view it as a growth opportunity for our brands and for Booking.com in particular, and most importantly, our customers have gotten used to having a world-class content and great experience, both in booking and at stay. And that's something that we're determined to deliver. With respect to alternative accommodations, we also have, I think, one of the best distribution networks. In other words, one of the best ways to market those properties of any player in the space and look forward to doing that. In terms of how those are presented on the website, that's something that's determined by technology and the experience we have with users on the website. There's always an opportunity to select those properties for customers who want to use the various filters that are available. So there's a lot of different ways to get to them. But the most fundamental element of it is that we are trying to show the particular customer what they're most likely looking for and that drives the presentation."

Similar story for non-advertising OpEx, where the business has typically grown more quickly than those expenses have, and we feel good about being able to control that for the future. So that leaves the performance advertising, which is, by far, the biggest expense bucket. We've had several years now of pressure on that metric.

On the corporate travel opportunity, we always suspected that we had a substantial number of business users that were using our product, but we didn't until more recently have data on it, which is where that 1 in 5 number comes from. And that intuition gave us reason to look at the market more aggressively and try to build some functionality that would be targeted directly at corporate travelers. And so that 1 in 5 number represents the self-reported usage of our customers and what the opportunity is, is to build a business of business travelers using the tools that we provide for them and to try to get that share to go up. I wouldn't hazard a guess, as to whether it would ultimately be 50-50. In the United States, the average hotel has 30% business traveler, 30% leisure traveler and 30% large groups for big hotels, so that gives you sort of a breakdown at least in the U.S. market as to what the market kind of looks like. But we think there's a great opportunity to build awareness among business travelers that Booking.com in particular is a great place to go and for business owners to use the tools that we're building, which we think will help us build share there. With respect to marketing efficiencies in newer markets, it's traditionally been the pattern that we have been willing to invest in marketing in new markets in order to build share and to build awareness of our brands until we got to a point where we'd achieved enough scale where the more normal ROI patterns would obtain.

So with respect to the competitive environment and the Hotel Direct Book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites and they've done it over the years through driving single image pricing, through very substantial investment in their own web experience and we look at the availability of different prices for their members on the website as an evolution of that effort. Our approach is to try to make sure that our customers have the best prices that are published and available, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of accomplishing that. And I think that given the scale of our business, we're in a position where it's a reasonable ask that the largest player in the space be able to show competitive prices to its customers. My belief is that those efforts will continue, and we'll continue to press to make sure that we've got competitive pricing. And I will say that if, over the long term, the efforts by the chains or others is essentially starting to drive consumers to expect to book only discounted prices rather than published retail prices, that the ultimate impact of that on hotel ADRs is probably not going to be great for the chains and companies like ours and other large competitors that are in the space are very well positioned to advertise substantial discounts as well. And so my comment there is, at some point, it actually might not be a great idea to push the market and push consumers into expecting to book only at discounted prices. On BookingSuite, the product continues to evolve. I think the team is excited about revenue management tools that are now being made available to customers and I think the customer interest and uptake on that has been good. Ultimately, having our engine drive direct bookings for small and medium-sized hotels, we still believe, is a good thing for the hotel because it allows them to participate in a channel that they were not participating in and help build their brand via a direct website that we can build for them and certainly provide the booking engine for and ultimately, it does help us because it provides us with excellent inventory and builds our relationship with the hotel, which is, over time, very important to us as well."

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, fairly substantial growth in the size of the platform over the last couple of years, I think, is evidence of that. You can tell from the math, and we've said on prior occasions a number of times, that the typical average size of the property that we're bringing on to the platform now is smaller because we're dealing with non-hotel accommodations to a large degree and those tend to be much smaller than the larger hotels, most of which we've already addressed. Although there still is opportunity in the hotel space as well. So in some substantial opportunity to continue to increase the size of the platform, although diminishing return in terms of the number of rooms available per property."

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
I'm pleased to report that the group produced another solid quarter despite an often challenging market backdrop. Execution was consistent across the brands as we achieved several important milestones as a group. 
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $17.9 billion, up about 21% on a constant currency basis or about 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 16% or about 18% on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA increased to 8% to $867 million. Earnings per share were $11.60, up 17% versus the prior year. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $13.93, up 12% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. 
Our customers booked combination reservations for 141 million room nights in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with our reservation growth, considering the competitive nature of our markets as well as macro volatility in many travel markets experienced throughout the quarter. We believe the consistent growth we are reporting demonstrates the strength of our brands, the value of a diversified global footprint and solid execution by our brand management teams. 
Booking.com recorded another impressive quarter and we are excited to announce that we now have over 1 million properties on the Booking.com platform, which represents an increase of 30% over last year. The Booking team has nearly doubled the number of properties on its platform in just 2 years, a truly remarkable accomplishment that reflects the hard work and dedication that the Booking team employs on behalf of its customers and supply partners. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 493,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Our properties represent a combined total of approximately 23.7 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.3 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.3 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay. We believe that Booking.com has one of the largest platforms for vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties and offers the most customer friendly booking experience in the market. Booking.com also reached another milestone in the quarter as it surpassed over 1 million reservations booked in a single day on its website, an impressive measure that demonstrates the meaningful scale of our business. 
Agoda produced another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines as it continues to grow its global accommodation platform. The Asia-based Agoda team has built a world-class merchant supply platform, capable of amassing and serving a wide variety of private discount deals that has proven to be a great asset for the group. We are especially pleased to see group members leveraging the supply platform and availability for our customers. 
Consistent with the first quarter, KAYAK exceeded our expectations, posting strong growth in queries, revenue and profit. KAYAK continued its pace of innovation with the launch of several new products and enhancements, centered on new verticals, planning and travel tools and conversational travel services such as KAYAK's Facebook Messenger service, an exciting new way to search and book travel experiences. 
Rental car days for the group grew 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com delivered a strong quarter and witnessed robust demand for its services across all of its major geographical regions. Rentalcars.com continues to make investments in expanding its global supply base as well as enhancements to its customer service organization. 
Priceline.com made good progress on its efforts to reposition the business, including strengthening the management team, building more sustainable marketing programs and designing improved product offerings and customer service, all in an effort to position the business for a strong start in 2017. 
OpenTable delivered good bottom line performance in the quarter, driven by a healthy balance of top line growth and cost efficiencies. OpenTable is working on attractive growth opportunities, increasing the size and scope of its restaurant footprint in North America, using innovation to drive greater diner frequency and pursuing growth in international markets. 
I am particularly excited about the pace with which our brand teams have built the business on mobile platforms. It is clear that progress in building share in the mobile channel is a critical component of delivering overall growth in the business. Product excellence, distribution and mobile marketing and monetization are all key components. You can see why this remains a top priority for all our brands. 
In summary, the group executed another solid quarter. Focus by our brand leadership on controlling spending contributed to better-than-expected margins, underlining that a core strength of our business is control of operating expenses, which allows us to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while investing in future growth. 
We've now turned our attention to the third quarter and our busy summer travel season. We feel good about our outlook for the third quarter, albeit in a global travel market that is certain to remain volatile due to economic uncertainty and the scourge of terrorism. All of our employees are intently focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience during this busy season. 
As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2016. 
All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q2 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group, with room night growth of 24% compared to 31% in Q1. Our growth did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast, resulting in room night and gross bookings performance that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. This momentum has carried over into Q3 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. We are pleased with performance broadly across our key geographic regions. While recent terrorist attacks impacted gross bookings and cancellations in the markets affected, they did not have a significant discernible impact on our overall growth. Also, the Brexit vote caused a sizable devaluation in the British pound and creates uncertainty for the U.K.'s economic outlook, but our exposure for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, to U.K. destination gross profit and U.K. source market gross bookings was 10% or less as a share of our business. 
Rental car days grew by 8% in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1. Average daily rates per accommodations, or ADRs, were down by less than 1% for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and our forecast. Our Q2 gross bookings grew by 19% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. 
Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.4 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. As I mentioned when we last reported in May, we estimate that earlier Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would've been recognized in Q2 if Easter fell in Q2 as it did last year. The timing shift negatively impacts our Q2 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins compared to the prior year. Gross profit grew at a slower pace than gross bookings in Q2, primarily due to the impact of the Easter timing and bookings recorded in Q2 that will benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel occurs, rather than due to any significant change in commission rates or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites. 
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.1 billion, which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $327 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year. 
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-inter-company revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 22% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Operating income grew by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6% and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance, but decreased by 315 bps compared to Q2 last year. Operating margins for Q2 2016 compared to prior year Q2 were pressured by the Easter timing I referred to earlier, performance advertising and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2 from Q1. Performance advertising leverage was impacted by growth in paid marketing channels and growth in gross bookings that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. 
Performance advertising ROIs were stable for the quarter, but were under year-over-year pressure towards the end of the quarter and thus far, in Q3 as we have lapped the comp last year when ROI started to improve. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to better than forecasted ROIs for performance marketing, trimming of brand advertising by our brand teams and less non-ad OpEx spending that assumed, partly due to phasing shifting to Q3. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $867 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795 million and grew by 8% versus prior year. Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS grew by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 8% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 12%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. 
Net income also benefited from a lower effective tax rate in Q2 2016 due to the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in state tax law. GAAP net income in Q2 includes a non-cash charge in the amount of $12.9 million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of cost method investments, mainly related to the write off of our remaining investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance and funding needs of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil. We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not driven by our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1 billion of cash from operations during second quarter of 2016, which is about 38% above last year. We repurchased 236,000 shares of our common stock for $299 million during the quarter, and we purchased an additional $69 million of our common stock after the quarter closed in July. CapEx for the quarter amounted to $60 million. Our cash and investments amounted to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2016, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q3 guidance. Q3 is off to a solid start, with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our Q3 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. I'll highlight that the basket of foreign currencies in which we transact weakened on a weighted average basis by about 2% versus the U.S. dollar since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts last updated their forecast. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 18% to 23% and total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes the constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about less than 1% compared to the prior-year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 12% to 17%. We expect gross profit to grow by 15% to 20% in U.S. dollars and by 16% to 21% on a constant currency basis. We expect about 260 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, principally related to our assumptions for performance advertising. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing pressure on ROIs thus far in Q3 as we compare to periods with improved ROI performance last year. Our forecast assumes further ROI deterioration over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.73 billion and $1.83 billion, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% versus prior year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $26.10 and $27.60 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $28.30 to $29.80 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up about 15% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.3 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date. 
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the Euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. 
I would now like to outline some changes we will make in reporting non-GAAP financial metrics, which will be effective for guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward. First, our earnings releases and commentary in our earnings calls with respect to historical results will focus primarily on GAAP results. Second, we will continue to present adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, but will no longer deduct stock-based compensation, which, for us, has ranged between 2% and 3% of gross profit for the last few years. We will also discontinue adjusting for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and we will eventually sunset. We estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 after we change to our new approach will be approximately 17%. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice and we will provide information to assist investors in comparing our results from the fourth quarter on with prior periods on a consistent basis. 
We will now take your questions."

The China outbound market continues to be a market that is large and growing and that we all feel has great potential because of the demographic factors that are well known affecting China. We have a number of different ways to participate in it. We participate in it through our partnership with Ctrip, where our international hotels are shown to their customers and Booking.com and Agoda also participate directly in selling outbound to international travelers coming from China. I know there's been a lot written about a slowdown in overall economic growth in China, but we still view it as a very, very attractive market that will have substantial macro headwinds -- excuse me, tailwinds helping build both the middle-class and travel demand and we want to participate in it. With respect to alternative accommodations, as you can see by the numbers that we disclosed and sort of the ongoing property counts on Booking.com in particular, we have built a very large inventory of dynamically bookable non-hotel accommodations. And we view it as a growth opportunity for our brands and for Booking.com in particular, and most importantly, our customers have gotten used to having a world-class content and great experience, both in booking and at stay. And that's something that we're determined to deliver. With respect to alternative accommodations, we also have, I think, one of the best distribution networks. In other words, one of the best ways to market those properties of any player in the space and look forward to doing that. In terms of how those are presented on the website, that's something that's determined by technology and the experience we have with users on the website. There's always an opportunity to select those properties for customers who want to use the various filters that are available. So there's a lot of different ways to get to them. But the most fundamental element of it is that we are trying to show the particular customer what they're most likely looking for and that drives the presentation."

On the corporate travel opportunity, we always suspected that we had a substantial number of business users that were using our product, but we didn't until more recently have data on it, which is where that 1 in 5 number comes from. And that intuition gave us reason to look at the market more aggressively and try to build some functionality that would be targeted directly at corporate travelers. And so that 1 in 5 number represents the self-reported usage of our customers and what the opportunity is, is to build a business of business travelers using the tools that we provide for them and to try to get that share to go up. I wouldn't hazard a guess as to whether it would ultimately be 50-50. In the United States, the average hotel has 30% business traveler, 30% leisure traveler and 30% large groups for big hotels, so that gives you sort of a breakdown at least in the U.S. market as to what the market kind of looks like. But we think there's a great opportunity to build awareness among business travelers that Booking.com in particular is a great place to go and for business owners to use the tools that we're building, which we think will help us build share there. With respect to marketing efficiencies in newer markets, it's traditionally been the pattern that we have been willing to invest in marketing in new markets in order to build share and to build awareness of our brands until we got to a point where we'd achieved enough scale where the more normal ROI patterns would obtain. I don't have anything particular to report to you on that front. There may still be some markets where we're not long tenured and are doing some investing and that would be very, very consistent with how we've run the business over the long term."

One that we get a lot from investors, Jeff, I'd love to get your take is, how the competitive environment might be changing as a result of some of the hotel groups pivoting more towards trying to drive direct booking awareness, either through couponing or discounting or loyalty reward programs? How do you think that's impacting the competitive environment? And the second one on BookingSuite, wanted to know if we can get an update there on how the product set continues to evolve, what they might be doing more broadly for the platform, especially with respect to driving sort of loyalty around inventory?"

So with respect to the competitive environment and the Hotel Direct Book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites and they've done it over the years",402,"Okay, thank you, Ed. So with respect to the competitive environment and the Hotel Direct Book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites and they've done it over the years through driving single-image pricing, through very substantial investment in their own web experience and we look at the availability of different prices for their members on the website as an evolution of that effort. Our approach is to try to make sure that our customers have the best prices that are published and available, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of accomplishing that. And I think that given the scale of our business, we're in a position where it's a reasonable ask that the largest player in the space be able to show competitive prices to its customers. My belief is that those efforts will continue, and we'll continue to press to make sure that we've got competitive pricing. And I will say that if, over the long term, the efforts by the chains or others is essentially starting to drive consumers to expect to book only discounted prices rather than published retail prices, that the ultimate impact of that on hotel ADRs is probably not going to be great for the chains and companies like ours, and other large competitors that are in the space are very well positioned to advertise substantial discounts as well. And so my comment there is, at some point, it actually might not be a great idea to push the market and push consumers into expecting to book only at discounted prices. On BookingSuite, the product continues to evolve. I think the team is excited about revenue management tools that are now being made available to customers and I think the customer interest and uptake on that has been good. Ultimately, having our engine drive direct bookings for small- and medium-sized hotels, we still believe, is a good thing for the hotel because it allows them to participate in a channel that they were not participating in and help build their brand via a direct website that we can build for them and certainly provide the booking engine for and ultimately, it does help us because it provides us with excellent inventory and builds our relationship with the hotel, which is, over time, very important to us as well."

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, fairly substantial growth in the size of the platform over the last couple of years, I think, is evidence of that. You can tell from the math, and we've said on prior occasions a number of times, that the typical average size of the property that we're bringing onto the platform now is smaller because we're dealing with non-hotel accommodations to a large degree and those tend to be much smaller than the larger hotels, most of which we've already addressed.

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. 
I'm pleased to report that the group produced another solid quarter despite an often challenging market backdrop. Execution was consistent across the brands as we achieved several important milestones as a group. 
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $17.9 billion, up about 21% on a constant currency basis or about 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 16% or about 18% on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA increased to 8% to $867 million. Earnings per share were $11.60, up 17% versus the prior year. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $13.93, up 12% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. 
Our customers booked combination reservations for 141 million room nights in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with our reservation growth, considering the competitive nature of our markets as well as macro volatility in many travel markets experienced throughout the quarter. We believe the consistent growth we are reporting demonstrates the strength of our brands, the value of a diversified global footprint and solid execution by our brand management teams. 
Booking.com recorded another impressive quarter and we are excited to announce that we now have over 1 million properties on the Booking.com platform, which represents an increase of 30% over last year. The Booking team has nearly doubled the number of properties on its platform in just 2 years, a truly remarkable accomplishment that reflects the hard work and dedication that the Booking team employs on behalf of its customers and supply partners. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 493,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Our properties represent a combined total of approximately 23.7 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.3 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.3 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay. We believe that Booking.com has one of the largest platforms for vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties and offers the most customer friendly booking experience in the market. Booking.com also reached another milestone in the quarter as it surpassed over 1 million reservations booked in a single day on its website, an impressive measure that demonstrates the meaningful scale of our business. 
Agoda produced another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines as it continues to grow its global accommodation platform. The Asia-based Agoda team has built a world-class merchant supply platform, capable of amassing and serving a wide variety of private discount deals that has proven to be a great asset for the group. We are especially pleased to see group members leveraging the supply platform and availability for our customers. 
Consistent with the first quarter, KAYAK exceeded our expectations, posting strong growth in queries, revenue and profit. KAYAK continued its pace of innovation with the launch of several new products and enhancements, centered on new verticals, planning and travel tools and conversational travel services such as KAYAK's Facebook Messenger service, an exciting new way to search and book travel experiences. 
Rental car days for the group grew 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com delivered a strong quarter and witnessed robust demand for its services across all of its major geographical regions. Rentalcars.com continues to make investments in expanding its global supply base as well as enhancements to its customer service organization. 
Priceline.com made good progress on its efforts to reposition the business, including strengthening the management team, building more sustainable marketing programs and designing improved product offerings and customer service, all in an effort to position the business for a strong start in 2017. 
OpenTable delivered good bottom line performance in the quarter, driven by a healthy balance of top line growth and cost efficiencies. OpenTable is working on attractive growth opportunities, increasing the size and scope of its restaurant footprint in North America, using innovation to drive greater diner frequency and pursuing growth in international markets. 
I am particularly excited about the pace with which our brand teams have built the business on mobile platforms. It is clear that progress in building share in the mobile channel is a critical component of delivering overall growth in the business. Product excellence, distribution and mobile marketing and monetization are all key components. You can see why this remains a top priority for all our brands. 
In summary, the group executed another solid quarter. Focus by our brand leadership on controlling spending contributed to better-than-expected margins, underlining that a core strength of our business is control of operating expenses, which allows us to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while investing in future growth. 
We've now turned our attention to the third quarter and our busy summer travel season. We feel good about our outlook for the third quarter, albeit in a global travel market that is certain to remain volatile due to economic uncertainty and the scourge of terrorism. All of our employees are intently focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience during this busy season. 
As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q2 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group, with room night growth of 24% compared to 31% in Q1. Our growth did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast, resulting in room night and gross bookings performance that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. This momentum has carried over into Q3 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. We are pleased with performance broadly across our key geographic regions. While recent terrorist attacks impacted gross bookings and cancellations in the markets affected, they did not have a significant discernible impact on our overall growth. Also, the Brexit vote caused a sizable devaluation in the British pound and creates uncertainty for the U.K.'s economic outlook, but our exposure for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, to U.K. destination gross profit and U.K. source market gross bookings was 10% or less as a share of our business. 
Rental car days grew by 8% in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1. Average daily rates per accommodations, or ADRs, were down by less than 1% for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and our forecast. Our Q2 gross bookings grew by 19% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. 
Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.4 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. As I mentioned when we last reported in May, we estimate that earlier Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would've been recognized in Q2 if Easter fell in Q2 as it did last year. The timing shift negatively impacts our Q2 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins compared to the prior year. Gross profit grew at a slower pace than gross bookings in Q2, primarily due to the impact of the Easter timing and bookings recorded in Q2 that will benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel occurs, rather than due to any significant change in commission rates or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites. 
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.1 billion, which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $327 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year. 
Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-inter-company revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 22% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Operating income grew by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6% and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance, but decreased by 315 bps compared to Q2 last year. Operating margins for Q2 2016 compared to prior year Q2 were pressured by the Easter timing I referred to earlier, performance advertising and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2 from Q1. Performance advertising leverage was impacted by growth in paid marketing channels and growth in gross bookings that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. 
Performance advertising ROIs were stable for the quarter, but were under year-over-year pressure towards the end of the quarter and thus far, in Q3 as we have lapped the comp last year when ROI started to improve. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to better than forecasted ROIs for performance marketing, trimming of brand advertising by our brand teams and less non-ad OpEx spending that assumed, partly due to phasing shifting to Q3. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $867 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795 million and grew by 8% versus prior year. Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS grew by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 8% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 12%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. 
Net income also benefited from a lower effective tax rate in Q2 2016 due to the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in state tax law. GAAP net income in Q2 includes a non-cash charge in the amount of $12.9 million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of cost method investments, mainly related to the write off of our remaining investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance and funding needs of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil. We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not driven by our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1 billion of cash from operations during second quarter of 2016, which is about 38% above last year. We repurchased 236,000 shares of our common stock for $299 million during the quarter, and we purchased an additional $69 million of our common stock after the quarter closed in July. CapEx for the quarter amounted to $60 million. Our cash and investments amounted to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2016, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q3 guidance. Q3 is off to a solid start, with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our Q3 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. I'll highlight that the basket of foreign currencies in which we transact weakened on a weighted average basis by about 2% versus the U.S. dollar since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts last updated their forecast. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 18% to 23% and total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes the constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about less than 1% compared to the prior-year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 12% to 17%. We expect gross profit to grow by 15% to 20% in U.S. dollars and by 16% to 21% on a constant currency basis. We expect about 260 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, principally related to our assumptions for performance advertising. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing pressure on ROIs thus far in Q3 as we compare to periods with improved ROI performance last year. Our forecast assumes further ROI deterioration over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.73 billion and $1.83 billion, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% versus prior year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $26.10 and $27.60 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $28.30 to $29.80 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up about 15% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.3 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date. 
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the Euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. 
I would now like to outline some changes we will make in reporting non-GAAP financial metrics, which will be effective for guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward. First, our earnings releases and commentary in our earnings calls with respect to historical results will focus primarily on GAAP results. Second, we will continue to present adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, but will no longer deduct stock-based compensation, which, for us, has ranged between 2% and 3% of gross profit for the last few years. We will also discontinue adjusting for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and we will eventually sunset. We estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 after we change to our new approach will be approximately 17%. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice and we will provide information to assist investors in comparing our results from the fourth quarter on with prior periods on a consistent basis. 
We will now take your questions."

The China outbound market continues to be a market that is large and growing and that we all feel has great potential because of the demographic factors that are well known affecting China. We have a number of different ways to participate in it. We participate in it through our partnership with Ctrip, where our international hotels are shown to their customers and Booking.com and Agoda also participate directly in selling outbound to international travelers coming from China. I know there's been a lot written about a slowdown in overall economic growth in China, but we still view it as a very, very attractive market that will have substantial macro headwinds -- excuse me, tailwinds helping build both the middle-class and travel demand and we want to participate in it. With respect to alternative accommodations, as you can see by the numbers that we disclosed and sort of the ongoing property counts on Booking.com in particular, we have built a very large inventory of dynamically bookable non-hotel accommodations. And we view it as a growth opportunity for our brands and for Booking.com in particular, and most importantly, our customers have gotten used to having a world-class content and great experience, both in booking and at stay. And that's something that we're determined to deliver. With respect to alternative accommodations, we also have, I think, one of the best distribution networks. In other words, one of the best ways to market those properties of any player in the space and look forward to doing that. In terms of how those are presented on the website, that's something that's determined by technology and the experience we have with users on the website. There's always an opportunity to select those properties for customers who want to use the various filters that are available. So there's a lot of different ways to get to them. But the most fundamental element of it is that we are trying to show the particular customer what they're most likely looking for and that drives the presentation."

Similar story for non-advertising OpEx, where the business has typically grown more quickly than those expenses have, and we feel good about being able to control that for the future. So that leaves the performance advertising, which is, by far, the biggest expense bucket. We've had several years now of pressure on that metric. Our Q2 results show some pressure and our guidance for Q3 expects to, again, be pressured. Beyond that, we don't have a forecast where you can make your own prediction as to how that will play out, but that's been the track record to date."

On the corporate travel opportunity, we always suspected that we had a substantial number of business users that were using our product, but we didn't until more recently have data on it, which is where that 1 in 5 number comes from. And that",317,"Thanks, Tom. On the corporate travel opportunity, we always suspected that we had a substantial number of business users that were using our product, but we didn't until more recently have data on it, which is where that 1 in 5 number comes from. And that intuition gave us reason to look at the market more aggressively and try to build some functionality that would be targeted directly at corporate travelers. And so that 1 in 5 number represents the self-reported usage of our customers and what the opportunity is, is to build a business of business travelers using the tools that we provide for them and to try to get that share to go up. I wouldn't hazard a guess as to whether it would ultimately be 50-50. In the United States, the average hotel has 30% business traveler, 30% leisure traveler and 30% large groups for big hotels, so that gives you sort of a breakdown at least in the U.S. market as to what the market kind of looks like. But we think there's a great opportunity to build awareness among business travelers that Booking.com in particular is a great place to go and for business owners to use the tools that we're building, which we think will help us build share there. With respect to marketing efficiencies in newer markets, it's traditionally been the pattern that we have been willing to invest in marketing in new markets in order to build share and to build awareness of our brands until we got to a point where we'd achieved enough scale where the more normal ROI patterns would obtain. I don't have anything particular to report to you on that front. There may still be some markets where we're not long tenured and are doing some investing and that would be very, very consistent with how we've run the business over the long term."

So with respect to the competitive environment and the Hotel Direct Book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites and they've done it over the years",402,"Okay, thank you, Ed. So with respect to the competitive environment and the Hotel Direct Book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites and they've done it over the years through driving single-image pricing, through very substantial investment in their own web experience and we look at the availability of different prices for their members on the website as an evolution of that effort. Our approach is to try to make sure that our customers have the best prices that are published and available, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of accomplishing that. And I think that given the scale of our business, we're in a position where it's a reasonable ask that the largest player in the space be able to show competitive prices to its customers. My belief is that those efforts will continue, and we'll continue to press to make sure that we've got competitive pricing. And I will say that if, over the long term, the efforts by the chains or others is essentially starting to drive consumers to expect to book only discounted prices rather than published retail prices, that the ultimate impact of that on hotel ADRs is probably not going to be great for the chains and companies like ours, and other large competitors that are in the space are very well positioned to advertise substantial discounts as well. And so my comment there is, at some point, it actually might not be a great idea to push the market and push consumers into expecting to book only at discounted prices. On BookingSuite, the product continues to evolve. I think the team is excited about revenue management tools that are now being made available to customers and I think the customer interest and uptake on that has been good. Ultimately, having our engine drive direct bookings for small- and medium-sized hotels, we still believe, is a good thing for the hotel because it allows them to participate in a channel that they were not participating in and help build their brand via a direct website that we can build for them and certainly provide the booking engine for and ultimately, it does help us because it provides us with excellent inventory and builds our relationship with the hotel, which is, over time, very important to us as well."

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group brands executed well, delivering on peak summer travel demand in the quarter. All of our global employees worked hard to make sure our customers had fantastic travel experiences, from our property teams driving availability in the quarter to our customer service teams handling the volumes of requests during our busiest season.
Our financial results indicate favorable trends in the business. The group reported year-over-year room night growth of 29% for the third quarter, which represents acceleration over the second quarter. Consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter were approximately $18.5 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 25% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 22% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $10.13, which was negatively impacted by a $941 million non-cash impairment charge that I will discuss in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $31.18, up 23% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter and FactSet's consensus estimates of $29.92.
Booking.com executed another strong quarter, showing acceleration in both room night and gross bookings growth. This acceleration for such a large business is a testament to Booking's growing inventory of hotel and non-hotel accommodations and its ability to optimize peak season travel demand with tools and automation to make sure it has the best availability, combined with a seamless customer experience. Booking's property teams remained active in the quarter as its total property count now stands at approximately 1,065,000, which represents a year-over-year increase of 29%. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 529,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Booking.com's properties represent a combined total of approximately 24.4 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.9 million are within our traditional hotel partners, and 7.5 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay.
Our non-hotel properties continue to grow nicely as we build one of the largest platforms of instantly bookable vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties in the market today. Adding supply at these growth rates creates momentum in the business beyond the current quarter as new properties typically become more productive over time once brought on to the Booking.com platform.
Booking.com is also making substantial investments to drive future growth, including constant front-end experimentation, new product developments such as Booking for Business and building more extensive distribution partnerships to extend the reach of the business. Exciting new relationships, such as Southwest Airlines, demonstrate how we are available to bring the power of our deep global distribution platform to enhance our partners' customer experience.
The Priceline.com team is working hard to improve performance in marketing, product, front end and mobile offerings. We believe The priceline.com's leadership team is making smart decisions to position this leading brand for growth in the future. We are pleased to announce the promotion of Brett Keller to CEO from Interim CEO, recognizing the passionate and skilled leadership he has brought to the brand since taking the helm.
KAYAK delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth while also investing in the future. KAYAK worked towards executing on its key initiatives for the year, usability improvements, customer optimization and the development of new mobile tools. KAYAK also announced its expansion in Asia Pacific and Latin America, 2 key geographic regions. With a greater presence in Asia Pacific, KAYAK will be better positioned to capitalize one of the largest online travel markets in the world. Additional resources in its Miami office will allow KAYAK to continue its fast paced growth in Latin America, where it already has operations in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru.
Agoda posted a strong quarter with accelerating top line growth. It is particularly important to note that the growth came primarily through direct channels, which grew faster than its pay channels. Moreover, Agoda continues to see high rates of mobile growth across its customer base. Agoda continued investments in its merchant supply platform, which enables it to control its content, innovate and participate aggressively in closed user group and other discount offerings, which play an important role in the APAC market.
Rental car days for the group grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com's strong performance. rentalcars.com saw its rental car days accelerate in the quarter and witnessed robust demand across most of its key geographies. The team delivered on a busy summer season and executed a very solid quarter despite continued macro and currency pressures resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, turning to OpenTable. You will see in our recently filed 10-Q that we recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of approximately $941 million. The impairment is the result of a change in OpenTable's business strategy relating to the pace of its international expansion and other growth initiatives. Importantly, this change in strategy allows OpenTable to invest in building its inventory of bookable restaurants and restaurant listings; in innovation around user experience and cloud-based restaurant tools; in new product development, particularly in casual dining; and in international expansion. OpenTable has delivered good results over the past 2 quarters with earnings growth driven by cost discipline versus plan and growth in diners making reservations on OpenTable's branded sites. OpenTable's investments in future growth include completion of its international technology platform, which will allow it to sell more effectively into the global traveler market and to work on important product enhancements aimed at driving diner growth. We remain enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for OpenTable.
In summary, the group executed well during our busiest quarter, producing record financial results. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
Q3 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group with acceleration in room night growth to 29% compared to 24% in Q2. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and this momentum has carried over into Q4 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance.
Rental car days growth also accelerated to 13% in Q3 compared to 8% in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down by less than 1% for Q3 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to all results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and were in line with our forecast.
Q3 gross bookings grew by 25%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group is $3.6 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 23% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year.
Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q3 is 41 bps lower than prior year Q3. The decrease is mainly due to normal book versus pay time lag with accelerating gross bookings growth in Q3 and an expanding booking window. Other smaller contributing factors to the variance are the level of accommodation participation and preferred placement and commission override programs, business mix and discounted closed user group rates. We continue to believe that our commission rates are sustainable over the long term based upon the value that we deliver to our travel partners at a relatively low distribution cost.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.3 billion, which grew by 25% in U.S. dollars and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $335 million, which was about flat with prior year. U.S. gross profit for Q3 2016 and 2015 includes benefits in the amount of $5.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, related to favorable travel transaction tax rulings in Hawaii.
Advertising and other revenue, which mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 11% in Q3 compared to the prior year.
Operating income declined by 44%, including the $941 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to OpenTable. OpenTable has delivered healthy growth in diner reservations and improved operating results under the leadership of Christa Quarles and her management team. The impairment results form a [ph] reduction to our long-term forecasted results for the business based upon actual results since the acquisition and a change in strategy for the business going forward.
The OpenTable team will continue to pursue its international expansion opportunity and other growth initiatives going forward, but we will invest at a measured pace that is more commensurate with the current growth trajectory of the business. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is excluded from non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not indicative of our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 19%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance but decreased by 161 bps compared to Q3 last year due to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs and our acceleration in top line growth that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. Operating margin performance is better than our forecast due to slightly better-than-forecasted advertising efficiency and less non-ad OpEx spending than assumed, partly due to spend shifting to Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is still [ph] at the top end of our guidance range of $1.83 billion and grew by 19% versus prior year. GAAP net income decreased by 58%, and fully diluted EPS decreased by 57%, in both cases, inclusive of the [ph] $941 million impairment charge I discussed a moment ago. Non-GAAP net income increased by 20%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of a lower share count resulting from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2016, which is about 15% above last year. We repurchased 144,000 shares of our common stock for $199 million during the quarter, and we've repurchased an additional $25 million of our common stock after quarter close.
CapEx for the quarter amounted to $54 million. We entered into a contract in Q3 to build a 753,000-square-foot building with capacity for 4,600 employees in Amsterdam to serve as the headquarters for Booking.com. Our Booking.com team in Amsterdam is currently housed in several buildings across the city. We believe bringing the team together in a modern headquarters in the center of one of the greatest cities in the world will produce operational benefits. The project also makes sense from a financial perspective as we will use international cash to build what we believe will be valuable real estate in the Amsterdam market. We expect the building to be completed in 2020 for a total cost of approximately EUR 270 million plus the cost of office without [ph] furnishing and fixtures.
Q3 investing cash flows include about $54 million paid towards the project, including $48 million paid to obtain use rights through the end upon [ph] which we will build. We expect to pay about $40 million of the project cost in 2017 with the remainder paid over 2018 through 2020. Our cash and investments amounted to $13.7 billion at September 30, 2016, with about $1.5 billion of that amount from the U.S.
Now for Q4 guidance. As I mentioned when we reported our results last quarter, starting with our guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward, we are changing our reporting for non-GAAP financial metrics. The guidance for Q4 that I am about to give for adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income includes the cost of stock-based compensation. We are also no longer reducing income tax expense for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and will eventually sunset as our NOLs are used or expire. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice. Our Q3 earnings release that was just issued includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to the corresponding GAAP measure prepared using this new methodology for each quarter of 2015 and the first 3 quarters of 2016 to invest -- to assist investors with the transition.
Q4 is off to a solid start with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflected difficult comp starting in December and running through Q1 2017 because our room night growth accelerated fairly significantly in the prior year comparable periods.
Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by 16% to 21% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be about the same as the prior year period. We expect gross profit to grow by 13% to 18% in U.S. dollars and by 14% to 19% on a constant currency basis.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $755 million and $795 million, which at the midpoint is up 8% versus prior year. We forecasted adjusted EBITDA will grow more slowly than gross profit due to forecasted ROI pressure for performance advertising. Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs.
We are pleased with the balance struck by our brand teams in Q3 and thus far in Q4 to deliver exceptional top line growth with healthy bottom line growth and market leading adjusted EBITDA margins. We forecast GAAP EPS between $11.40 and $12 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date.
Our EPS guidance also benefits from a forecasted tax rate of 12% compared to the prior year tax rate of 18%, which results from forecasted mix of pretax earnings between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. earnings, which include interest expense on our debt and the cost of our corporate group [ph] , are taxed at substantially higher rates than our international earnings and are down in our Q4 forecast compared to the prior year.
We are targeting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $12.20 to $12.80 per share, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 14%, which is lower than the prior year rate for the same reasons discussed a moment ago for the GAAP tax rate.
As we model 2017, we estimate a full year non-GAAP tax rate of about 18%. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

I see it was probably strong across our demand channels, too. So there's nothing to call out in particular for you there. It was broad-based strength in the macro environment relatively healthy for us. That same story has continued thus far in Q4. We assume that will decelerate from here on out, I'd say to a lesser extent than typical for November because we have the comp against the Paris terrorist attacks, and to a greater extent than usual, for the month of December, given the difficult comp that we had in the prior year. And then the ROI is better than the forecast. I think you can get a sense for the split between how much of the margin pressure is driven by the acceleration in the business relative to ROI pressure by looking at the growth in performance advertising relative to our gross bookings growth, and then the disconnect there will give an indication of ROI pressure in the remainder the performance advertising relative to gross profit [indiscernible] book versus day time lag."

They are doing a good job building the business from U.S. customers booking accommodations for purely domestic travel.

And I think for Booking.com, in particular, which is a -- our largest business and is very active and effective in advertising in paid channels. The relationship between the share of direct in share or paid is driven by a couple of things, and one of those is our success in building direct business through brand advertising, direct business from repeat customers who are loyal to our brands and in mobile channels to the degree we can drive app downloads and app usage. But on the other side, there are -- the other factors are the relative attractiveness of the paid channels with which we do business. And I think it's our view that if we can drive business at an attractive ROI, whether it's through paid search, through metasearch channels, through partnerships, which is something that we've worked hard and gotten some good results on, we will absolutely do that. And the opportunity in the paid market is -- has been attractive, so I don't think we view there has been a sea change in either our goals around this or an abrupt change in mix shift. I think we mentioned, with respect to Agoda, they had a good quarter of driving growth in their direct channels, but I don't think you all should extrapolate that that's representative of some very significant change in how we look at or operate the business. Then with respect to capital structure, I think the answer is similar to answer to what we've done. I think we've established now a pretty good track record of consistently buying back our stock. We have an authorization in place, and I don't see any reason at this point in time that that would change dramatically from what we've done in the past."

First is they have great velocity in just the day in and day out front-end testing user experience. They run a lot of experiments, and some of those experiments represent what might look on its face to be a trivial change to the way something is presented or the way a particular call-to-action button is identified, but the sum total of all those experiments and the ones that make their way to deployment on the website drive conversion, drive growth and can drive improvements to monetization. So those are very, very important. They take up substantial development efforts, and it's a big part of not only what KAYAK does, but what all of our brands do. I think some of the more interesting things that KAYAK has been working on are around artificial intelligence, natural language processing with Alexa, Facebook Messenger trying to be able to respond to a customer's spoken query, which is at its early stages now. It's not generating a ton of business, but I do believe it's at the front end of some pretty important changes in the Internet in general and the way people interact with technology, and KAYAK's doing a very good job of being out in front of that. In terms of the CEO search, there's no particular update to report today other than to say continuous pace with our board committee who is working on it, and I think making progress. And when we have an announcement, you guys will be the first to know."

So I think with respect to the partnership business, and I'd make this answer for all of our brands, we definitely are interested in affiliate relationships where the affiliate has a brand, independent content, a reason for customers to go to their site independent of purely hotel booking, and I think those partnerships are bringing growing business to the group. I don't have a particular number to associate for their contribution, but if we can make the right kind of deals, if we can have partnerships that allow us to show our brand to consumers and have them experience the product, we like them. And I think we're in a very strong position to compete for that business in many markets because of the comprehensiveness of our inventory and the quality of our technology and customer experience, with respect to Booking for Business, Booking for Business is off to a good start. It's still a relatively new initiative. I'm not in a position to give you a number as to the specific contribution of the business to our total growth. I can't say that business travelers represent a reasonable amount of the business we have in Booking.com and are generally participating in the overall growth of that business. That's distinct from businesses, companies that are actually signing up for and using the Booking for Business tools. That represents a small amount of business today, but it's growing nicely. And I think we have a very attractive product for business users, and I expect that to do good things in the future. We are quite optimistic about it. I don't think that Booking.com or any of our other brands are at a point of diminishing marginal returns from front-end experimentation and innovation. And when you think about it, because the technology that surrounds us and that we employ in our business and that we interact with with our partners is constantly changing, that means that the opportunity and the need for innovation is constantly there. So we could have thought that we were potentially running into diminishing returns in desktop, and then a new technology comes up like -- that allows you to show additional database returns without leaving the page, which just created a massive opportunity for our engineers and product people to code great innovation and things that help the customer while they're in the shopping process. It's one very small example of a change in technology that happened several years ago that was a very significant game changer in terms of the things that you could do on a desktop website. And there's just more and more of those happening in all the platforms that we interact with. So I don't see there ever being a time when the opportunity and also, quite frankly, the need to innovate on the front end is marginalized because of these changing technologies. I hope that's helpful."

We think it gives us good brand advertising, particularly in U.S. for Booking.com, as we continue to look to grow the brand here.

And then Google is continuously experimenting and iterating with different ways of answering travel queries for their customers, and we work closely with them. They've been a great partner for us. We'll continue to work with them as they add new channels in the future, new ad placements and look for ways that it will work for us and for them. I mean, to date, it's mostly about them trying to give their customer a better experience and give us and other OTAs a more qualified lead. And they've had some success with that. And when we get a more qualified lead, it converts better and so we're able to pay more. And so, think that they're going to continue to experiment in the future.

I think the numbers that we've been reporting for the last couple of quarters are showing that the group is doing well. Our brands are doing well and participating in the migration of the business to mobile. And I think in some markets, particularly in the developing markets, it's really -- it's not, per se, a migration. It's more that the business is developing initially as a mobile business because, for many users in those markets, the mobile devices their primary or their only access to the Internet. And so for example, you mentioned app usage in some markets, and particularly in Asia Pacific, accessed through downloading of apps is a much more important factor than it is in other more developed markets, where apps can tend to represent a relatively smaller percentage of overall business. I think that our brands have done a good job building us world-class mobile user experiences. I think that we found ways to experiment on those platforms and in those operating systems, which allowed us to continue to improve the user experience. I think we've been able to take the expertise that we've had in performance marketing in nonmobile channels and over time build up that same kind of expertise in mobile channels so that we're able to gain share of business coming in paid channels, and our scale is obviously a big help in that regard because we have the most comprehensive inventory and great conversions, so that allows us to compete aggressively for placement in mobile advertising venues. So the mobile business continues to grow and to grow as a share of the total business. I think it over time becomes a more mainstream channel than perhaps it was in the early days of mobile where it was a venue for discounting and for a special way of looking at the business. Now in many regards, it really is a mobile-first world in that the product view that you have really starts off with a mobile view. I think our brands are doing a good job in that regard, and I think you all should realize that that's absolutely a first priority for us in terms of how we look at the world from both a development perspective and from a marketing perspective."

About half of that was due to the normal lag between the time the booking occurs and travel occurs. We had accelerating growth in the quarter, so that will typically put more pressure on that metric. And then we have seen pretty steady expansion in our booking window. So there's been some of the bar building. You're right that the close end bookings have been very strong. That's been driven to a large degree by mobile, but we've also seen an expansion in booking window, so people also are comfortable making their bookings far in advance than they had in the past. That could be just a function of people continuing to get comfortable with our model, particularly the agency model for Booking.com, the flexibility that that gives them in terms of making a booking, having their vacation secured, and then if they need to change the plans, they're able to do that. The other drivers that put some pressure on the take rate in the quarter, I referenced the participation by  the level of participation by hotels and preferred placement and commission overrides. That's a function of experiments that we run from time to time to work with sort order and see if we move hotels from preferred placement that maybe aren't converting as well as as that would be a net positive experiment for us. So not necessarily going to be a trend long term. And then commission overrides, the extent that hotels participate in that is generally driven by the relative levels of occupancy and desire to push up the commission rate in order to drive more demand. I also mentioned business mix, so just the mix of properties and regions that are propelling our business. And you saw that to an extent with lower-commission regions and properties and put some pressure on the metric as well."

And our brand advertising -- and I think you can see in the numbers, has not grown the way you may have seen it grow in last year in particular and maybe the early part of this year. So the spending has come down a little bit. And in part, that's probably because of some of that crowding. With respect to the decline in airline tickets. I think that's a priceline.com metric, and it's driven over the long term by a general deterioration in the economics that are available to an online travel agent for selling an airline ticket, which means it gets less marketing support in general. And in the short term, as part of the efforts by Priceline to sort of reorient the business here for better sustainable long-term positioning, there's been a further diminishing of investment in performance-based marketing and in particular for airline tickets. So I think those are probably the 2 principal drivers of that trend."

Certainly, the actual results that we reported in Q3 and the guidance we're giving Q4 points to more pressure than pockets of strength."

And from our perspective, that provides a real opportunity to build a deeper relationship with the customer if they're interacting with your product while they're traveling, while they're in destination. And because we have that connection and the data around their travel, where they're going, when they're going, et cetera, and in many cases, the customer is traveling with one of their -- one of our apps on their mobile device, we continue to be very, very interested in that opportunity. I think the -- specifically, with respect to OpenTable, we also remain convinced that that logic applies to dining and travelers are all dining when they're on their trip and that we've got an opportunity to provide content reservation-making ability to those travelers, but we have an appreciation of the challenges inherent in doing that.

We -- but we do have a better appreciation of the challenges of making those connections with our existing brands."

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group brands executed well, delivering on peak summer travel demand in the quarter. All of our global employees worked hard to make sure our customers had fantastic travel experiences, from our property teams driving availability in the quarter to our customer service teams handling the volumes of requests during our busiest season.
Our financial results indicate favorable trends in the business. The group reported year-over-year room night growth of 29% for the third quarter, which represents acceleration over the second quarter. Consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter were approximately $18.5 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 25% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 22% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $10.13, which was negatively impacted by a $941 million non-cash impairment charge that I will discuss in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $31.18, up 23% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter and FactSet's consensus estimates of $29.92.
Booking.com executed another strong quarter, showing acceleration in both room night and gross bookings growth. This acceleration for such a large business is a testament to Booking's growing inventory of hotel and non-hotel accommodations and its ability to optimize peak season travel demand with tools and automation to make sure it has the best availability, combined with a seamless customer experience. Booking's property teams remained active in the quarter as its total property count now stands at approximately 1,065,000, which represents a year-over-year increase of 29%. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 529,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Booking.com's properties represent a combined total of approximately 24.4 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.9 million are within our traditional hotel partners, and 7.5 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay.
Our non-hotel properties continue to grow nicely as we build one of the largest platforms of instantly bookable vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties in the market today. Adding supply at these growth rates creates momentum in the business beyond the current quarter as new properties typically become more productive over time once brought on to the Booking.com platform.
Booking.com is also making substantial investments to drive future growth, including constant front-end experimentation, new product developments such as Booking for Business and building more extensive distribution partnerships to extend the reach of the business. Exciting new relationships, such as Southwest Airlines, demonstrate how we are available to bring the power of our deep global distribution platform to enhance our partners' customer experience.
The Priceline.com team is working hard to improve performance in marketing, product, front end and mobile offerings. We believe the priceline.com's leadership team is making smart decisions to position this leading brand for growth in the future. We are pleased to announce the promotion of Brett Keller to CEO from Interim CEO, recognizing the passionate and skilled leadership he has brought to the brand since taking the helm.
KAYAK delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth while also investing in the future. KAYAK worked towards executing on its key initiatives for the year, usability improvements, customer optimization and the development of new mobile tools. KAYAK also announced its expansion in Asia Pacific and Latin America, 2 key geographic regions. With a greater presence in Asia Pacific, KAYAK will be better positioned to capitalize one of the largest online travel markets in the world. Additional resources in its Miami office will allow KAYAK to continue its fast paced growth in Latin America, where it already has operations in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru.
Agoda posted a strong quarter with accelerating top line growth. It is particularly important to note that the growth came primarily through direct channels, which grew faster than its pay channels. Moreover, Agoda continues to see high rates of mobile growth across its customer base. Agoda continued investments in its merchant supply platform, which enables it to control its content, innovate and participate aggressively in closed user group and other discount offerings, which play an important role in the APAC market.
Rental car days for the group grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com's strong performance. rentalcars.com saw its rental car days accelerate in the quarter and witnessed robust demand across most of its key geographies. The team delivered on a busy summer season and executed a very solid quarter despite continued macro and currency pressures resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, turning to OpenTable. You will see in our recently filed 10-Q that we recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of approximately $941 million. The impairment is the result of a change in OpenTable's business strategy relating to the pace of its international expansion and other growth initiatives. Importantly, this change in strategy allows OpenTable to invest in building its inventory of bookable restaurants and restaurant listings; in innovation around user experience and cloud-based restaurant tools; in new product development, particularly in casual dining; and in international expansion. OpenTable has delivered good results over the past 2 quarters with earnings growth driven by cost discipline versus plan and growth in diners making reservations on OpenTable's branded sites. OpenTable's investments in future growth include completion of its international technology platform, which will allow it to sell more effectively into the global traveler market and to work on important product enhancements aimed at driving diner growth. We remain enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for OpenTable.
In summary, the group executed well during our busiest quarter, producing record financial results. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
Q3 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group with acceleration in room night growth to 29% compared to 24% in Q2. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and this momentum has carried over into Q4 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance.
Rental car days growth also accelerated to 13% in Q3 compared to 8% in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down by less than 1% for Q3 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to all results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and were in line with our forecast.
Q3 gross bookings grew by 25%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group is $3.6 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 23% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year.
Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q3 is 41 bps lower than prior year Q3. The decrease is mainly due to normal book versus day time lag with accelerating gross bookings growth in Q3 and an expanding booking window. Other smaller contributing factors to the variance are the level of accommodation participation and preferred placement and commission override programs, business mix and discounted closed user group rates. We continue to believe that our commission rates are sustainable over the long term based upon the value that we deliver to our travel partners at a relatively low distribution cost.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.3 billion, which grew by 25% in U.S. dollars and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $335 million, which was about flat with prior year. U.S. gross profit for Q3 2016 and 2015 includes benefits in the amount of $5.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, related to favorable travel transaction tax rulings in Hawaii.
Advertising and other revenue, which mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 11% in Q3 compared to the prior year.
Operating income declined by 44%, including the $941 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to OpenTable. OpenTable has delivered healthy growth in diner reservations and improved operating results under the leadership of Christa Quarles and her management team. The impairment results from a reduction to our long-term forecasted results for the business based upon actual results since the acquisition and a change in strategy for the business going forward.
The OpenTable team will continue to pursue its international expansion opportunity and other growth initiatives going forward, but we will invest at a measured pace that is more commensurate with the current growth trajectory of the business. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is excluded from non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not indicative of our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 19%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance but decreased by 161 bps compared to Q3 last year due to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs and our acceleration in top line growth that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. Operating margin performance is better than our forecast due to slightly better-than-forecasted advertising efficiency and less non-ad OpEx spending than assumed, partly due to spend shifting to Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is seated at the top end of our guidance range of $1.83 billion and grew by 19% versus prior year. GAAP net income decreased by 58%, and fully diluted EPS decreased by 57%, in both cases, inclusive of the [ph] $941 million impairment charge I discussed a moment ago. Non-GAAP net income increased by 20%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of a lower share count resulting from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2016, which is about 15% above last year. We repurchased 144,000 shares of our common stock for $199 million during the quarter, and we've repurchased an additional $25 million of our common stock after quarter close.
CapEx for the quarter amounted to $54 million. We entered into a contract in Q3 to build a 753,000-square-foot building with capacity for 4,600 employees in Amsterdam to serve as the headquarters for Booking.com. Our Booking.com team in Amsterdam is currently housed in several buildings across the city. We believe bringing the team together in a modern headquarters in the center of one of the greatest cities in the world will produce operational benefits. The project also makes sense from a financial perspective as we will use international cash to build what we believe will be valuable real estate in the Amsterdam market. We expect the building to be completed in 2020 for a total cost of approximately EUR 270 million plus the cost of office without furnishing and fixtures.
Q3 investing cash flows include about $54 million paid towards the project, including $48 million paid to obtain use rights through the year-end upon, which we will build. We expect to pay about $40 million of the project cost in 2017 with the remainder paid over 2018 through 2020. Our cash and investments amounted to $13.7 billion at September 30, 2016, with about $1.5 billion of that amount from the U.S.
Now for Q4 guidance. As I mentioned when we reported our results last quarter, starting with our guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward, we are changing our reporting for non-GAAP financial metrics. The guidance for Q4 that I am about to give for adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income includes the cost of stock-based compensation. We are also no longer reducing income tax expense for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and will eventually sunset as our NOLs are used or expire. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice. Our Q3 earnings release that was just issued includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to the corresponding GAAP measure prepared using this new methodology for each quarter of 2015 and the first 3 quarters of 2016 to invest -- to assist investors with the transition.
Q4 is off to a solid start with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflected difficult comp starting in December and running through Q1 2017 because our room night growth accelerated fairly significantly in the prior year comparable periods.
Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by 16% to 21% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be about the same as the prior year period. We expect gross profit to grow by 13% to 18% in U.S. dollars and by 14% to 19% on a constant currency basis.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $755 million and $795 million, which at the midpoint is up 8% versus prior year. We forecasted adjusted EBITDA will grow more slowly than gross profit due to forecasted ROI pressure for performance advertising. Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs.
We are pleased with the balance struck by our brand teams in Q3 and thus far in Q4 to deliver exceptional top line growth with healthy bottom line growth and market leading adjusted EBITDA margins. We forecast GAAP EPS between $11.40 and $12 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date.
Our EPS guidance also benefits from a forecasted tax rate of 12% compared to the prior year tax rate of 18%, which results from forecasted mix of pretax earnings between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. earnings, which include interest expense on our debt and the cost of our corporate group, are taxed at substantially higher rates than our international earnings and are down in our Q4 forecast compared to the prior year.
We are targeting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $12.20 to $12.80 per share, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 14%, which is lower than the prior year rate for the same reasons discussed a moment ago for the GAAP tax rate.
As we model 2017, we estimate a full year non-GAAP tax rate of about 18%. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

I mean, it was broad-based strength, and the macro environment feels relatively healthy for us. That same story has continued thus far in Q4. We assume that will decelerate from here on out, I'd say, to a lesser extent than typical for November because we have the comp against the Paris terrorist attacks and to a greater extent than usual, for the month of December given the difficult comp that we had in the prior year. And then the ROI is better than the forecast. I think you can get a sense for the split between how much of the margin pressure is driven by the acceleration in the business relative to ROI pressure by looking at the growth in performance advertising relative to our gross bookings growth, and then the disconnect there would give you an indication of ROI pressure, and the remainder of the performance advertising relative to gross profit is due to book versus day time lag."

We've been forecasting and experiencing modest deleverage on that line as a fairly long-term trend.

And I think, for Booking.com, in particular, which is a -- our largest business and is very active and effective in advertising in paid channels, the relationship between the share of direct and share of paid is driven by a couple of different things. And while one of the -- one of those is our success in building direct business through brand advertising, through direct business from repeat customers who are loyal to our brands and in mobile channels to the degree we can drive app downloads and app usage, but on the other side, there -- the other factors are the relative attractiveness of the paid channels with which we do business. And I think it's our view that if we can drive business at an attractive ROI, whether it's through paid search, through metasearch channels, through partnerships, which is something that we've worked hard and gotten some good results on, we'll absolutely do that. And the opportunity in the paid market is -- has been attractive. So I don't think we view there has been a sea change in either our goals around this or an abrupt change in mix shift. I think we mentioned with respect to Agoda that they had a good quarter of driving growth in their direct channels, but I don't think you all should extrapolate that, that's representative of some very significant change in how we look at or operate the business. Then with respect to capital structure, I think the answer is similar to answer to what we've done. I think we've established now a pretty good track record of consistently buying back our stock. We have an authorization in place, and I don't see any reason at this point in time that, that would change dramatically from what we've done in the past."

First is they have great velocity in just the day in and day out front-end testing user experience. They run a lot of experiments, and some of those experiments represent what might look on its face to be a trivial change to the way something is presented or the way a particular call-to-action button is identified, but the sum total of all of those experiments and the ones that make their way to deployment on the website drive conversion, drive growth and can drive improvements to monetization. So those are very, very important. They take up substantial development efforts, and it's a big part of not only what KAYAK does but what all of our brands do. I think some of the more interesting things that KAYAK has been working on are around artificial intelligence, natural language processing with Alexa, Facebook Messenger, trying to be able to respond to a customer's spoken query, which is at its early stages now. It's not generating a ton of business, but I do believe it's at the front end of some pretty important changes in the Internet in general and the way people interact with technology, and KAYAK's doing a very good job of being out in front of that. In terms of the CEO search, there's no particular update to report today other than to say continuous pace with our board committee who is working on it and I think making progress.

So I think with respect to the partnership business, and I'd make this answer for all of our brands, we definitely are interested in affiliate relationships where the affiliate has a brand, independent content, a reason for customers to go to their site independent of purely hotel booking, and I think those partnerships are bringing growing business to the group. I don't have a particular number to associate with their contribution, but if we can make the right kind of deals, if we can have partnerships that allow us to show our brand to consumers and have them experience the product, we like them. And I think we're in a very strong position to compete for that business in many markets because of the comprehensiveness of our inventory and the quality of our technology and customer experience. With respect to Booking for Business, Booking for Business is off to a good start. It's still a relatively new initiative. I'm not in a position to give you a number as to the specific contribution of the business to our total growth. I can say that business travelers represent a reasonable amount of the business we have in Booking.com and are generally participating in the overall growth of that business. That's distinct from businesses, companies that are actually signing up for and using the Booking for Business tools. That represents a smaller amount of business today, but it's growing nicely. And I think we have a very attractive product for business users, and I expect that to do good things in the future. We're quite optimistic about it. I don't think that Booking.com or any of our other brands are at a point of diminishing marginal returns from front-end experimentation and innovation. And when you think about it, because the technology that surrounds us and that we employ in our business and that we interact with, with our partners is constantly changing, that means that the opportunity and the need for innovation is constantly there. So we could have thought that we were potentially running into diminishing returns in desktop, and then a new technology comes up like -- that allows you to show additional database returns without leaving the page, which just created a massive opportunity for our engineers and product people to code great innovation and things that help the customer while they're in the shopping process. It's one very small example of a change in technology that happened several years ago that was a very significant game changer in terms of the things that you could do on a desktop website. And there's just more and more of those happening on all the platforms that we interact with. So I don't see there ever being a time when the opportunity and also, quite frankly, the need to innovate on the front end is marginalized because of these changing technologies. I hope that's helpful."

In terms of Trip and Instant Book, no update really from what we've told you on prior calls. We're happy to be participating in that channel. We think it gives us good brand advertising, particularly in the U.S. for Booking.com, as we continue to look to grow the brand here.

And then Google is continuously experimenting and iterating with different ways of answering travel queries for their customers, and we work closely with them. They've been a great partner for us. We'll continue to work with them as they add new channels in the future, new ad placements and look for ways that it will work for us and for them. I mean, to date, it's mostly been about them trying to give their customer a better experience and give us and other OTAs a more qualified lead. And they've had some success with that. And when we get a more qualified lead, it converts better, and so we're able to pay more. And so I think that they're going to continue to experiment in the future.

I think the numbers that we've been reporting for the last couple of quarters are showing that the group is doing well. Our brands are doing well in participating in the migration of the business to mobile. And I think in some markets, particularly in the developing markets, it's really -- it's not per se a migration. It's more that the business is developing initially as a mobile business because, for many users in those markets, the mobile device is their primary or their only access to the Internet. And so for example, you mentioned app usage in some markets and particularly in Asia Pacific, access through downloading of apps is a much more important factor than it is in other more developed markets, where apps can tend to represent a relatively smaller percentage of overall business. I think that our brands have done a good job building us world-class mobile user experiences. I think that we found ways to experiment on those platforms and in those operating systems, which have allowed us to continue to improve the user experience. I think we've been able to take the expertise that we've had in performance marketing in non-mobile channels and over time build up that same kind of expertise in mobile channels so that we're able to gain share of business coming in paid channels. And our scale is obviously a big help in that regard because we have the most comprehensive inventory and great conversions. So that allows us to compete aggressively for placement in mobile advertising venues. So the mobile business continues to grow and to grow as a share of the total business. I think it's -- it, over time, becomes a more mainstream channel than perhaps it was in the early days of mobile, where it was a venue for discounting and for a special way of looking at the business now. In many regards, it really is a mobile-first world in that the product view that you have really starts off with a mobile view. I think our brands are doing a good job in that regard, and I think you all should realize that, that's a -- absolutely a first priority for us in terms of how we look at the world from both a development perspective and from a marketing perspective."

So there's been somewhat of a barbeling. You're right that close-end bookings have been very strong, and that's been driven to a large degree by mobile. But we've also seen an expansion in booking window, so people are also comfortable making their bookings far in advance than they have in the past. That could be just a function of people continuing to get comfortable with our model, particularly the agency model for Booking.com and the flexibility that, that gives them in terms of making a booking, having their vacation secured, and then if they need to change their plans, they're able to do that. The other drivers that put some pressure on the take rate in the quarter, I referenced the participation by -- the level of participation by hotels and preferred placement and commission overrides. That's a function of experiments that we run from time to time to work with sort order and see if we remove hotels from preferred placement that maybe aren't converting as well, is that going to be a net positive experiment for us, not necessarily going to be a trend long term. And then commission overrides, the extent that hotels participate in that is generally driven by the relative levels of occupancy and their desire to push up their commission rates in order to drive more demand. I also mentioned business mix, so just the mix of properties and regions that are propelling our business. And you saw that, to an extent, was with lower-commission regions and properties and put some pressure on the metric as well."

So the spending has come down a little bit. And in part, that's probably because of some of that crowding. With respect to the decline in airline tickets, I think that's a priceline.com metric, and it's driven over the long term by a general deterioration in the economics that are available to an online travel agent for selling an airline ticket, which means it gets less marketing support in general. And in the short term, as part of the efforts by Priceline to sort of reorient the business here for better sustainable long-term positioning, there's been a further diminishing of investment in performance-based marketing and in particular for airline tickets. So I think those are probably the 2 principal drivers of that trend."

And from our perspective, that provides a real opportunity to build a deeper relationship with the customer if they're interacting with your product while they're traveling, while they're in destination. And because we have that connection and the data around their travel, where they're going, when they're going, et cetera, and in many cases, the customer is traveling with one of their -- one of our apps on their mobile device, we continue to be very, very interested in that opportunity. I think the -- specifically, with respect to OpenTable, we also remain convinced that, that logic applies to dining and that travelers are all dining when they're on their trip and that we've got an opportunity to provide content, reservation making ability to those travelers. But we have an appreciation of the challenges inherent in doing that. And I think that those learnings will definitely inform us with respect to future acquisitions, but I don't think they're necessarily going to discourage us from considering them or ultimately doing them. We -- but we do have a better appreciation of the challenges of making those connections with our existing brands."

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group brands executed well, delivering on peak summer travel demand in the quarter. All of our global employees worked hard to make sure our customers had fantastic travel experiences, from our property teams driving availability in the quarter to our customer service teams handling the volumes of requests during our busiest season.
Our financial results indicate favorable trends in the business. The group reported year-over-year room night growth of 29% for the third quarter, which represents acceleration over the second quarter. Consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter were approximately $18.5 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 25% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 22% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $10.13, which was negatively impacted by a $941 million non-cash impairment charge that I will discuss in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $31.18, up 23% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter and FactSet's consensus estimates of $29.92.
Booking.com executed another strong quarter, showing acceleration in both room night and gross bookings growth. This acceleration for such a large business is a testament to Booking's growing inventory of hotel and non-hotel accommodations and its ability to optimize peak season travel demand with tools and automation to make sure it has the best availability, combined with a seamless customer experience. Booking's property teams remained active in the quarter as its total property count now stands at approximately 1,065,000, which represents a year-over-year increase of 29%. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 529,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Booking.com's properties represent a combined total of approximately 24.4 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.9 million are within our traditional hotel partners, and 7.5 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay.
Our non-hotel properties continue to grow nicely as we build one of the largest platforms of instantly bookable vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties in the market today. Adding supply at these growth rates creates momentum in the business beyond the current quarter as new properties typically become more productive over time once brought on to the Booking.com platform.
Booking.com is also making substantial investments to drive future growth, including constant front-end experimentation, new product developments such as Booking for Business and building more extensive distribution partnerships to extend the reach of the business. Exciting new relationships, such as Southwest Airlines, demonstrate how we are available to bring the power of our deep global distribution platform to enhance our partners' customer experience.
The Priceline.com team is working hard to improve performance in marketing, product, front end and mobile offerings. We believe the priceline.com's leadership team is making smart decisions to position this leading brand for growth in the future. We are pleased to announce the promotion of Brett Keller to CEO from Interim CEO, recognizing the passionate and skilled leadership he has brought to the brand since taking the helm.
KAYAK delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth while also investing in the future. KAYAK worked towards executing on its key initiatives for the year, usability improvements, customer optimization and the development of new mobile tools. KAYAK also announced its expansion in Asia Pacific and Latin America, 2 key geographic regions. With a greater presence in Asia Pacific, KAYAK will be better positioned to capitalize on one of the largest online travel markets in the world. Additional resources in its Miami office will allow KAYAK to continue its fast-paced growth in Latin America, where it already has operations in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru.
Agoda posted a strong quarter with accelerating top line growth. It is particularly important to note that the growth came primarily through direct channels, which grew faster than its pay channels. Moreover, Agoda continues to see high rates of mobile growth across its customer base. Agoda continued investments in its merchant supply platform, which enables it to control its content, innovate and participate aggressively in closed user group and other discount offerings, which play an important role in the APAC market.
Rental car days for the group grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com's strong performance. rentalcars.com saw its rental car days accelerate in the quarter and witnessed robust demand across most of its key geographies. The team delivered on a busy summer season and executed a very solid quarter despite continued macro and currency pressures resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, turning to OpenTable. You will see in our recently filed 10-Q that we recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of approximately $941 million. The impairment is the result of a change in OpenTable's business strategy relating to the pace of its international expansion and other growth initiatives. Importantly, this change in strategy allows OpenTable to invest in building its inventory of bookable restaurants and restaurant listings; in innovation around user experience and cloud-based restaurant tools; in new product development, particularly in casual dining; and in international expansion. OpenTable has delivered good results over the past 2 quarters with earnings growth driven by cost discipline versus plan and growth in diners making reservations on OpenTable's branded sites. OpenTable's investments in future growth include completion of its international technology platform, which will allow it to sell more effectively into the global traveler market and to work on important product enhancements aimed at driving diner growth. We remain enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for OpenTable.
In summary, the group executed well during our busiest quarter, producing record financial results. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Q3 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group with acceleration in room night growth to 29% compared to 24% in Q2. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and this momentum has carried over into Q4 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance.
Rental car days growth also accelerated to 13% in Q3 compared to 8% in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down by less than 1% for Q3 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and were in line with our forecast.
Q3 gross bookings grew by 25%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $3.6 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 23% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year.
Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q3 is 41 bps lower than prior year Q3. The decrease is mainly due to normal book versus day time lag with accelerating gross bookings growth in Q3 and an expanding booking window. Other smaller contributing factors to the variance are the level of accommodation participation in preferred placement and commission override programs, business mix and discounted closed user group rates. We continue to believe that our commission rates are sustainable over the long term based upon the value that we deliver to our travel partners at a relatively low distribution cost.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.3 billion, which grew by 25% in U.S. dollars and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $335 million, which was about flat with prior year. U.S. gross profit for Q3 2016 and 2015 includes benefits in the amount of $5.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, related to favorable travel transaction tax rulings in Hawaii.
Advertising and other revenue, which mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 11% in Q3 compared to the prior year.
Operating income declined by 44%, including the $941 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to OpenTable. OpenTable has delivered healthy growth in diner reservations and improved operating results under the leadership of Christa Quarles and her management team. The impairment results from a reduction to our long-term forecasted results for the business based upon actual results since the acquisition and a change in strategy for the business going forward.
The OpenTable team will continue to pursue its international expansion opportunity and other growth initiatives going forward, but we will invest at a measured pace that is more commensurate with the current growth trajectory of the business. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is excluded from non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not indicative of our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 19%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance but decreased by 161 bps compared to Q3 last year due to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs and our acceleration in top line growth that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to slightly better-than-forecasted advertising efficiency and less non-ad OpEx spending than assumed, partly due to spend shifting to Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.9 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.83 billion and grew by 19% versus prior year. GAAP net income decreased by 58%, and fully diluted EPS decreased by 57%, in both cases, inclusive of the [ph] $941 million impairment charge I discussed a moment ago. Non-GAAP net income increased by 20%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of a lower share count resulting from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2016, which is about 15% above last year. We repurchased 144,000 shares of our common stock for $199 million during the quarter, and we've purchased an additional $25 million of our common stock after quarter close.
CapEx for the quarter amounted to $54 million. We entered into a contract in Q3 to build a 753,000-square-foot building with capacity for 4,600 employees in Amsterdam to serve as the headquarters for Booking.com. Our Booking.com team in Amsterdam is currently housed in several buildings across the city. We believe bringing the team together in a modern headquarters in the center of one of the greatest cities in the world will produce operational benefits. The project also makes sense from a financial perspective as we will use international cash to build what we believe will be valuable real estate in the Amsterdam market. We expect the building to be completed in 2020 for a total cost of approximately EUR 270 million plus the cost of office without furnishing and fixtures.
Q3 investing cash flows include about $54 million paid towards the project, including $48 million paid to obtain use rights through year-end upon which we will build. We expect to pay about $40 million of the project cost in 2017 with the remainder paid over 2018 through 2020. Our cash and investments amounted to $13.7 billion at September 30, 2016, with about $1.5 billion of that amount from the U.S.
Now for Q4 guidance. As I mentioned when we reported our results last quarter, starting with our guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward, we are changing our reporting for non-GAAP financial metrics. The guidance for Q4 that I am about to give for adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income includes the cost of stock-based compensation. We are also no longer reducing income tax expense for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and will eventually sunset as our NOLs are used or expire. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice. Our Q3 earnings release that was just issued includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to the corresponding GAAP measure prepared using this new methodology for each quarter of 2015 and the first 3 quarters of 2016 to invest -- to assist investors with the transition.
Q4 is off to a solid start with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflected difficult comp starting in December and running through Q1 2017 because our room night growth accelerated fairly significantly in the prior year comparable periods.
Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by 16% to 21% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be about the same as the prior year period. We expect gross profit to grow by 13% to 18% in U.S. dollars and by 14% to 19% on a constant currency basis.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $755 million and $795 million, which at the midpoint is up 8% versus prior year. We forecasted adjusted EBITDA will grow more slowly than gross profit due to forecasted ROI pressure for performance advertising. Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs.
We are pleased with the balance struck by our brand teams in Q3 and thus far in Q4 to deliver exceptional top line growth with healthy bottom line growth and market leading adjusted EBITDA margins. We forecast GAAP EPS between $11.40 and $12 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date.
Our EPS guidance also benefits from a forecasted tax rate of 12% compared to the prior year tax rate of 18%, which results from forecasted mix of pretax earnings between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. earnings, which include interest expense on our debt and the cost of our corporate group, are taxed at substantially higher rates than our international earnings and are down in our Q4 forecast compared to the prior year.
We are targeting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $12.20 to $12.80 per share, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 14%, which is lower than the prior year rate for the same reasons discussed a moment ago for the GAAP tax rate.
As we model 2017, we estimate a full year non-GAAP tax rate of about 18%. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

I mean, it was broad-based strength, and the macro environment feels relatively healthy for us. That same story has continued thus far in Q4. We assume that will decelerate from here on out, I'd say, to a lesser extent than typical for November because we have the comp against the Paris terrorist attacks and to a greater extent than usual, for the month of December given the difficult comp that we had in the prior year. And then the ROI is better than the forecast. I think you can get a sense for the split between how much of the margin pressure is driven by the acceleration in the business relative to ROI pressure by looking at the growth in performance advertising relative to our gross bookings growth, and then the disconnect there would give you an indication of ROI pressure, and the remainder of the performance advertising relative to gross profit is due to book versus day time lag."

I wouldn't say that there's some macro trend in that regard that you should expect to see reflected in the entire business. And keep in mind that Agoda, being in the Asia-Pacific market, that's a market where mobile is growing particularly fast, and the mobile experience in many of those markets is much more driven by your success in getting customers to download apps. And obviously, once you've got an app download, you've got direct business. Booking.com is doing well in the United States. They've been in this market for years now. They've built a competitive inventory set, and while in the early days, the business was more characterized by inbound international travel. They are doing a good job building the business from U.S. customers booking accommodations for purely domestic travel. And I think we've said in the past that, based on the best information available to us, we think that Booking.com is gaining share of the market here in the United States for U.S. bookers and domestic travel, and we still believe that to be the case."

And I think, for Booking.com, in particular, which is a -- our largest business and is very active and effective in advertising in paid channels, the relationship between the share of direct and share of paid is driven by a couple of different things. And while one of the -- one of those is our success in building direct business through brand advertising, through direct business from repeat customers who are loyal to our brands and in mobile channels to the degree we can drive app downloads and app usage, but on the other side, there -- the other factors are the relative attractiveness of the paid channels with which we do business. And I think it's our view that if we can drive business at an attractive ROI, whether it's through paid search, through metasearch channels, through partnerships, which is something that we've worked hard and gotten some good results on, we'll absolutely do that. And the opportunity in the paid market is -- has been attractive. So I don't think we view there has been a sea change in either our goals around this or an abrupt change in mix shift. I think we mentioned with respect to Agoda that they had a good quarter of driving growth in their direct channels, but I don't think you all should extrapolate that, that's representative of some very significant change in how we look at or operate the business. Then with respect to capital structure, I think the answer is similar to answer to what we've done. I think we've established now a pretty good track record of consistently buying back our stock. We have an authorization in place, and I don't see any reason at this point in time that, that would change dramatically from what we've done in the past."

First is they have a great velocity in just the day-in and day-out front-end testing user experience. They run a lot of experiments, and some of those experiments represent what might look on its face to be a trivial change to the way something is presented or the way a particular call-to-action button is identified, but the sum total of all of those experiments and the ones that make their way to deployment on the website drive conversion, drive growth and can drive improvements to monetization. So those are very, very important. They take up substantial development efforts, and it's a big part of not only what KAYAK does but what all of our brands do. I think some of the more interesting things that KAYAK has been working on are around artificial intelligence, natural language processing with Alexa, Facebook Messenger, trying to be able to respond to a customer's spoken query, which is at its early stages now. It's not generating a ton of business, but I do believe it's at the front end of some pretty important changes in the Internet in general and the way people interact with technology, and KAYAK's doing a very good job of being out in the front of that. In terms of the CEO search, there's no particular update to report today other than to say continues apace with our board committee who is working on it and I think making progress.

So I think with respect to the partnership business, and I'd make this answer for all of our brands, we definitely are interested in affiliate relationships where the affiliate has a brand, independent content, a reason for customers to go to their site independent of purely hotel booking, and I think those partnerships are bringing growing business to the group. I don't have a particular number to associate with their contribution, but if we can make the right kind of deals, if we can have partnerships that allow us to show our brand to consumers and have them experience the product, we like them. And I think we're in a very strong position to compete for that business in many markets because of the comprehensiveness of our inventory and the quality of our technology and customer experience. With respect to Booking for Business, Booking for Business is off to a good start. It's still a relatively new initiative. I'm not in a position to give you a number as to the specific contribution of the business to our total growth. I can say that business travelers represent a reasonable amount of the business we have in Booking.com and are generally participating in the overall growth of that business. That's distinct from businesses, companies that are actually signing up for and using the Booking for Business tools. That represents a smaller amount of business today, but it's growing nicely. And I think we have a very attractive product for business users, and I expect that to do good things in the future. We're quite optimistic about it. I don't think that Booking.com or any of our other brands are at a point of diminishing marginal returns from front-end experimentation and innovation. And when you think about it, because the technology that surrounds us and that we employ in our business and that we interact with, with our partners is constantly changing, that means that the opportunity and the need for innovation is constantly there. So we could have thought that we were potentially running into diminishing returns in desktop, and then a new technology comes up like -- that allows you to show additional database returns without leaving the page, which just created a massive opportunity for our engineers and product people to code great innovation and things that help the customer while they're in the shopping process. It's one very small example of a change in technology that happened several years ago that was a very significant game changer in terms of the things that you could do on a desktop website. And there's just more and more of those happening on all the platforms that we interact with. So I don't see there ever being a time when the opportunity and also, quite frankly, the need to innovate on the front end is marginalized because of these changing technologies. I hope that's helpful."

I think the numbers that we've been reporting for the last couple of quarters are showing that the group is doing well. Our brands are doing well in participating in the migration of the business to mobile. And I think in some markets, particularly in the developing markets, it's really -- it's not per se a migration. It's more that the business is developing initially as a mobile business because, for many users in those markets, the mobile device is their primary or their only access to the Internet. And so for example, you mentioned app usage in some markets and particularly in Asia Pacific, access through downloading of apps is a much more important factor than it is in other more developed markets, where apps can tend to represent a relatively smaller percentage of overall business. I think that our brands have done a good job building us world-class mobile user experiences. I think that we found ways to experiment on those platforms and in those operating systems, which have allowed us to continue to improve the user experience. I think we've been able to take the expertise that we've had in performance marketing in non-mobile channels and over time build up that same kind of expertise in mobile channels so that we're able to gain share of business coming in paid channels. And our scale is obviously a big help in that regard because we have the most comprehensive inventory and great conversions. So that allows us to compete aggressively for placement in mobile advertising venues. So the mobile business continues to grow and to grow as a share of the total business. I think it's -- it, over time, becomes a more mainstream channel than perhaps it was in the early days of mobile, where it was a venue for discounting and for a special way of looking at the business now. In many regards, it really is a mobile-first world in that the product view that you have really starts off with a mobile view. I think our brands are doing a good job in that regard, and I think you all should realize that, that's a -- absolutely a first priority for us in terms of how we look at the world from both a development perspective and from a marketing perspective."

About half of that was due to the normal lag between the time when a booking occurs and travel occurs. We had accelerating growth in the quarter, so that will typically put more pressure on that metric. And then we have seen pretty steady expansion in our booking window. So there's been somewhat of a barbelling. You're right that close-end bookings have been very strong, and that's been driven to a large degree by mobile. But we've also seen an expansion in booking window, so people are also comfortable making their bookings farther in advance than they have in the past. That could be just a function of people continuing to get comfortable with our model, particularly the agency model for Booking.com and the flexibility that, that gives them in terms of making a booking, having their vacation secured, and then if they need to change their plans, they're able to do that. The other drivers that put some pressure on the take rate in the quarter, I referenced participation by -- the level of participation by hotels and preferred placement and commission overrides. That's a function of experiments that we run from time to time to work with sort order and see if we remove hotels from preferred placement that maybe aren't converting as well, is that going to be a net positive experiment for us. It's not necessarily going to be a trend long term. And then commission overrides, the extent that hotels participate in that is generally driven by the relative levels of occupancy and their desire to push up their commission rates in order to drive more demand. I also mentioned business mix, so just the mix of properties and regions that are propelling our business. And you saw that, to an extent, was with lower-commission regions and properties and put some pressure on the metric as well."

So the spending has come down a little bit. And in part, that's probably because of some of that crowding. With respect to the decline in airline tickets, I think that's a priceline.com metric, and it's driven over the long term by a general deterioration in the economics that are available to an online travel agent for selling an airline ticket, which means it gets less marketing support in general. And in the short term, as part of the efforts by Priceline to sort of reorient the business here for better sustainable long-term positioning, there's been a further diminishing of investment in performance-based marketing and in particular for airline tickets. So I think those are probably the 2 principal drivers of that trend."

I think the -- we continue to believe that the relationship that our brands are building with their traveling customers can provide an opportunity for us to offer a value to them while they're in destination, and you may have seen a release about the Booking.com experiences in a few cities where they're testing a program to provide access to attractions and so forth to their customers. And from our perspective, that provides a real opportunity to build a deeper relationship with the customer if they're interacting with your product while they're traveling, while they're in destination. And because we have that connection and the data around their travel, where they're going, when they're going, et cetera, and in many cases, the customer is traveling with one of their -- one of our apps on their mobile device, we continue to be very, very interested in that opportunity. I think the -- specifically, with respect to OpenTable, we also remain convinced that, that logic applies to dining and that travelers are all dining when they're on their trip and that we've got an opportunity to provide content, reservation-making ability to those travelers. But we have an appreciation of the challenges inherent in doing that. And I think that those learnings will definitely inform us with respect to future acquisitions, but I don't think they're necessarily going to discourage us from considering them or ultimately doing them. We -- but we do have a better appreciation of the challenges of making those connections with our existing brands."

I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group brands executed well, delivering on peak summer travel demand in the quarter. All of our global employees worked hard to make sure our customers had fantastic travel experiences, from our property teams driving availability in the quarter to our customer service teams handling the volumes of requests during our busiest season.
Our financial results indicate favorable trends in the business. The group reported year-over-year room night growth of 29% for the third quarter, which represents acceleration over the second quarter. Consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter were approximately $18.5 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 25% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 22% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $10.13, which was negatively impacted by a $941 million non-cash impairment charge that I will discuss in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $31.18, up 23% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter and FactSet's consensus estimates of $29.92.
Booking.com executed another strong quarter, showing acceleration in both room night and gross bookings growth. This acceleration for such a large business is a testament to Booking's growing inventory of hotel and non-hotel accommodations and its ability to optimize peak season travel demand with tools and automation to make sure it has the best availability, combined with a seamless customer experience. Booking's property teams remained active in the quarter as its total property count now stands at approximately 1,065,000, which represents a year-over-year increase of 29%. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 529,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Booking.com's properties represent a combined total of approximately 24.4 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.9 million are within our traditional hotel partners, and 7.5 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay.
Our non-hotel properties continue to grow nicely as we build one of the largest platforms of instantly bookable vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties in the market today. Adding supply at these growth rates creates momentum in the business beyond the current quarter as new properties typically become more productive over time once brought on to the Booking.com platform.
Booking.com is also making substantial investments to drive future growth, including constant front-end experimentation, new product developments such as Booking for Business and building more extensive distribution partnerships to extend the reach of the business. Exciting new relationships, such as Southwest Airlines, demonstrate how we are available to bring the power of our deep global distribution platform to enhance our partners' customer experience.
The Priceline.com team is working hard to improve performance in marketing, product, front end and mobile offerings. We believe the priceline.com's leadership team is making smart decisions to position this leading brand for growth in the future. We are pleased to announce the promotion of Brett Keller to CEO from Interim CEO, recognizing the passionate and skilled leadership he has brought to the brand since taking the helm.
KAYAK delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth while also investing in the future. KAYAK worked towards executing on its key initiatives for the year, usability improvements, customer optimization and the development of new mobile tools. KAYAK also announced its expansion in Asia Pacific and Latin America, 2 key geographic regions. With a greater presence in Asia Pacific, KAYAK will be better positioned to capitalize on one of the largest online travel markets in the world. Additional resources in its Miami office will allow KAYAK to continue its fast-paced growth in Latin America, where it already has operations in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru.
Agoda posted a strong quarter with accelerating top line growth. It is particularly important to note that the growth came primarily through direct channels, which grew faster than its pay channels. Moreover, Agoda continues to see high rates of mobile growth across its customer base. Agoda continued investments in its merchant supply platform, which enables it to control its content, innovate and participate aggressively in closed user group and other discount offerings, which play an important role in the APAC market.
Rental car days for the group grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by rentalcars.com's strong performance. rentalcars.com saw its rental car days accelerate in the quarter and witnessed robust demand across most of its key geographies. The team delivered on a busy summer season and executed a very solid quarter despite continued macro and currency pressures resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, turning to OpenTable. You will see in our recently filed 10-Q that we recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill of approximately $941 million. The impairment is the result of a change in OpenTable's business strategy relating to the pace of its international expansion and other growth initiatives. Importantly, this change in strategy allows OpenTable to invest in building its inventory of bookable restaurants and restaurant listings; in innovation around user experience and cloud-based restaurant tools; in new product development, particularly in casual dining; and in international expansion. OpenTable has delivered good results over the past 2 quarters with earnings growth driven by cost discipline versus plan and growth in diners making reservations on OpenTable's branded sites. OpenTable's investments in future growth include completion of its international technology platform, which will allow it to sell more effectively into the global traveler market and to work on important product enhancements aimed at driving diner growth. We remain enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for OpenTable.
In summary, the group executed well during our busiest quarter, producing record financial results. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
Q3 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group with acceleration in room night growth to 29% compared to 24% in Q2. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and this momentum has carried over into Q4 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance.
Rental car days growth also accelerated to 13% in Q3 compared to 8% in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down by less than 1% for Q3 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and were in line with our forecast.
Q3 gross bookings grew by 25%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $3.6 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 23% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year.
Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q3 is 41 bps lower than prior year Q3. The decrease is mainly due to normal book versus day time lag with accelerating gross bookings growth in Q3 and an expanding booking window. Other smaller contributing factors to the variance are the level of accommodation participation in preferred placement and commission override programs, business mix and discounted closed user group rates. We continue to believe that our commission rates are sustainable over the long term based upon the value that we deliver to our travel partners at a relatively low distribution cost.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.3 billion, which grew by 25% in U.S. dollars and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $335 million, which was about flat with prior year. U.S. gross profit for Q3 2016 and 2015 includes benefits in the amount of $5.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, related to favorable travel transaction tax rulings in Hawaii.
Advertising and other revenue, which mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 11% in Q3 compared to the prior year.
Operating income declined by 44%, including the $941 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to OpenTable. OpenTable has delivered healthy growth in diner reservations and improved operating results under the leadership of Christa Quarles and her management team. The impairment results from a reduction to our long-term forecasted results for the business based upon actual results since the acquisition and a change in strategy for the business going forward.
The OpenTable team will continue to pursue its international expansion opportunity and other growth initiatives going forward, but we will invest at a measured pace that is more commensurate with the current growth trajectory of the business. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is excluded from non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS because it is not indicative of our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 19%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance but decreased by 161 bps compared to Q3 last year due to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs and our acceleration in top line growth that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to slightly better-than-forecasted advertising efficiency and less non-ad OpEx spending than assumed, partly due to spend shifting to Q4.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.9 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.83 billion and grew by 19% versus prior year. GAAP net income decreased by 58%, and fully diluted EPS decreased by 57%, in both cases, inclusive of the [ph] $941 million impairment charge I discussed a moment ago. Non-GAAP net income increased by 20%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of a lower share count resulting from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2016, which is about 15% above last year. We repurchased 144,000 shares of our common stock for $199 million during the quarter, and we've purchased an additional $25 million of our common stock after quarter close.
CapEx for the quarter amounted to $54 million. We entered into a contract in Q3 to build a 753,000-square-foot building with capacity for 4,600 employees in Amsterdam to serve as the headquarters for Booking.com. Our Booking.com team in Amsterdam is currently housed in several buildings across the city. We believe bringing the team together in a modern headquarters in the center of one of the greatest cities in the world will produce operational benefits. The project also makes sense from a financial perspective as we will use international cash to build what we believe will be valuable real estate in the Amsterdam market. We expect the building to be completed in 2020 for a total cost of approximately EUR 270 million plus the cost of office without furnishing and fixtures.
Q3 investing cash flows include about $54 million paid towards the project, including $48 million paid to obtain use rights through year-end upon which we will build. We expect to pay about $40 million of the project cost in 2017 with the remainder paid over 2018 through 2020. Our cash and investments amounted to $13.7 billion at September 30, 2016, with about $1.5 billion of that amount from the U.S.
Now for Q4 guidance. As I mentioned when we reported our results last quarter, starting with our guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward, we are changing our reporting for non-GAAP financial metrics. The guidance for Q4 that I am about to give for adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income includes the cost of stock-based compensation. We are also no longer reducing income tax expense for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and will eventually sunset as our NOLs are used or expire. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice. Our Q3 earnings release that was just issued includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to the corresponding GAAP measure prepared using this new methodology for each quarter of 2015 and the first 3 quarters of 2016 to invest -- to assist investors with the transition.
Q4 is off to a solid start with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflected difficult comp starting in December and running through Q1 2017 because our room night growth accelerated fairly significantly in the prior year comparable periods.
Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by 16% to 21% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be about the same as the prior year period. We expect gross profit to grow by 13% to 18% in U.S. dollars and by 14% to 19% on a constant currency basis.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $755 million and $795 million, which at the midpoint is up 8% versus prior year. We forecasted adjusted EBITDA will grow more slowly than gross profit due to forecasted ROI pressure for performance advertising. Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs.
We are pleased with the balance struck by our brand teams in Q3 and thus far in Q4 to deliver exceptional top line growth with healthy bottom line growth and market leading adjusted EBITDA margins. We forecast GAAP EPS between $11.40 and $12 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date.
Our EPS guidance also benefits from a forecasted tax rate of 12% compared to the prior year tax rate of 18%, which results from forecasted mix of pretax earnings between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. earnings, which include interest expense on our debt and the cost of our corporate group, are taxed at substantially higher rates than our international earnings and are down in our Q4 forecast compared to the prior year.
We are targeting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $12.20 to $12.80 per share, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 14%, which is lower than the prior year rate for the same reasons discussed a moment ago for the GAAP tax rate.
As we model 2017, we estimate a full year non-GAAP tax rate of about 18%. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

I said it was strong across all of our key geographic regions. I'd say it was broadly strong across all of our demand channels, too, so there's nothing I could call out in particular for you there. I mean, it was broad-based strength, and the macro environment feels relatively healthy for us. That same story has continued thus far in Q4. We assume that will decelerate from here on out, I'd say, to a lesser extent than typical for November because we have the comp against the Paris terrorist attacks and to a greater extent than usual, for the month of December given the difficult comp that we had in the prior year. And then the ROI is better than the forecast. I think you can get a sense for the split between how much of the margin pressure is driven by the acceleration in the business relative to ROI pressure by looking at the growth in performance advertising relative to our gross bookings growth, and then the disconnect there would give you an indication of ROI pressure, and the remainder of the performance advertising relative to gross profit is due to book versus day time lag."

And obviously, once you've got an app download, you've got direct business. Booking.com is doing well in the United States. They've been in this market for years now. They've built a competitive inventory set, and while in the early days, the business was more characterized by inbound international travel. They are doing a good job building the business from U.S. customers booking accommodations for purely domestic travel. And I think we've said in the past that, based on the best information available to us, we think that Booking.com is gaining share of the market here in the United States for U.S. bookers and domestic travel, and we still believe that to be the case."

And I think, for Booking.com, in particular, which is a -- our largest business and is very active and effective in advertising in paid channels, the relationship between the share of direct and share of paid is driven by a couple of different things. And while one of the -- one of those is our success in building direct business through brand advertising, through direct business from repeat customers who are loyal to our brands and in mobile channels to the degree we can drive app downloads and app usage, but on the other side, there -- the other factors are the relative attractiveness of the paid channels with which we do business. And I think it's our view that if we can drive business at an attractive ROI, whether it's through paid search, through metasearch channels, through partnerships, which is something that we've worked hard and gotten some good results on, we'll absolutely do that. And the opportunity in the paid market is -- has been attractive. So I don't think we view there has been a sea change in either our goals around this or an abrupt change in mix shift. I think we mentioned with respect to Agoda that they had a good quarter of driving growth in their direct channels, but I don't think you all should extrapolate that, that's representative of some very significant change in how we look at or operate the business. Then with respect to capital structure, I think the answer is similar to answer to what we've done. I think we've established now a pretty good track record of consistently buying back our stock. We have an authorization in place, and I don't see any reason at this point in time that, that would change dramatically from what we've done in the past."

So those are very, very important. They take up substantial development efforts, and it's a big part of not only what KAYAK does but what all of our brands do. I think some of the more interesting things that KAYAK has been working on are around artificial intelligence, natural language processing with Alexa, Facebook Messenger, trying to be able to respond to a customer's spoken query, which is at its early stages now. It's not generating a ton of business, but I do believe it's at the front end of some pretty important changes in the Internet in general and the way people interact with technology, and KAYAK's doing a very good job of being out in the front of that.

So I think with respect to the partnership business, and I'd make this answer for all of our brands, we definitely are interested in affiliate relationships where the affiliate has a brand, independent content, a reason for customers to go to their site independent of purely hotel booking, and I think those partnerships are bringing growing business to the group. I don't have a particular number to associate with their contribution, but if we can make the right kind of deals, if we can have partnerships that allow us to show our brand to consumers and have them experience the product, we like them. And I think we're in a very strong position to compete for that business in many markets because of the comprehensiveness of our inventory and the quality of our technology and customer experience. With respect to Booking for Business, Booking for Business is off to a good start. It's still a relatively new initiative. I'm not in a position to give you a number as to the specific contribution of the business to our total growth. I can say that business travelers represent a reasonable amount of the business we have in Booking.com and are generally participating in the overall growth of that business. That's distinct from businesses, companies that are actually signing up for and using the Booking for Business tools. That represents a smaller amount of business today, but it's growing nicely. And I think we have a very attractive product for business users, and I expect that to do good things in the future. We're quite optimistic about it. I don't think that Booking.com or any of our other brands are at a point of diminishing marginal returns from front-end experimentation and innovation. And when you think about it, because the technology that surrounds us and that we employ in our business and that we interact with, with our partners is constantly changing, that means that the opportunity and the need for innovation is constantly there. So we could have thought that we were potentially running into diminishing returns in desktop, and then a new technology comes up like -- that allows you to show additional database returns without leaving the page, which just created a massive opportunity for our engineers and product people to code great innovation and things that help the customer while they're in the shopping process. It's one very small example of a change in technology that happened several years ago that was a very significant game changer in terms of the things that you could do on a desktop website. And there's just more and more of those happening on all the platforms that we interact with. So I don't see there ever being a time when the opportunity and also, quite frankly, the need to innovate on the front end is marginalized because of these changing technologies. I hope that's helpful."

I think the numbers that we've been reporting for the last couple of quarters are showing that the group is doing well. Our brands are doing well in participating in the migration of the business to mobile. And I think in some markets, particularly in the developing markets, it's really -- it's not per se a migration. It's more that the business is developing initially as a mobile business because, for many users in those markets, the mobile device is their primary or their only access to the Internet. And so for example, you mentioned app usage in some markets and particularly in Asia Pacific, access through downloading of apps is a much more important factor than it is in other more developed markets, where apps can tend to represent a relatively smaller percentage of overall business. I think that our brands have done a good job building us world-class mobile user experiences. I think that we found ways to experiment on those platforms and in those operating systems, which have allowed us to continue to improve the user experience. I think we've been able to take the expertise that we've had in performance marketing in non-mobile channels and over time build up that same kind of expertise in mobile channels so that we're able to gain share of business coming in paid channels. And our scale is obviously a big help in that regard because we have the most comprehensive inventory and great conversions. So that allows us to compete aggressively for placement in mobile advertising venues. So the mobile business continues to grow and to grow as a share of the total business. I think it's -- it, over time, becomes a more mainstream channel than perhaps it was in the early days of mobile, where it was a venue for discounting and for a special way of looking at the business now. In many regards, it really is a mobile-first world in that the product view that you have really starts off with a mobile view. I think our brands are doing a good job in that regard, and I think you all should realize that, that's a -- absolutely a first priority for us in terms of how we look at the world from both a development perspective and from a marketing perspective."

It's a great offering for Booking.com loyal users, special discounts that aren't widely available to people that haven't qualified for the Genius program.

About half of that was due to the normal lag between the time when a booking occurs and travel occurs. We had accelerating growth in the quarter, so that will typically put more pressure on that metric. And then we have seen pretty steady expansion in our booking window. So there's been somewhat of a barbelling. You're right that close-end bookings have been very strong, and that's been driven to a large degree by mobile. But we've also seen an expansion in booking window, so people are also comfortable making their bookings farther in advance than they have in the past. That could be just a function of people continuing to get comfortable with our model, particularly the agency model for Booking.com and the flexibility that, that gives them in terms of making a booking, having their vacation secured, and then if they need to change their plans, they're able to do that. The other drivers that put some pressure on the take rate in the quarter, I referenced participation by -- the level of participation by hotels and preferred placement and commission overrides. That's a function of experiments that we run from time to time to work with sort order and see if we remove hotels from preferred placement that maybe aren't converting as well, is that going to be a net positive experiment for us. It's not necessarily going to be a trend long term. And then commission overrides, the extent that hotels participate in that is generally driven by the relative levels of occupancy and their desire to push up their commission rates in order to drive more demand. I also mentioned business mix, so just the mix of properties and regions that are propelling our business. And you saw that, to an extent, was with lower-commission regions and properties and put some pressure on the metric as well."

So the spending has come down a little bit. And in part, that's probably because of some of that crowding. With respect to the decline in airline tickets, I think that's a priceline.com metric, and it's driven over the long term by a general deterioration in the economics that are available to an online travel agent for selling an airline ticket, which means it gets less marketing support in general. And in the short term, as part of the efforts by Priceline to sort of reorient the business here for better sustainable long-term positioning, there's been a further diminishing of investment in performance-based marketing and in particular for airline tickets. So I think those are probably the 2 principal drivers of that trend."

I think the -- we continue to believe that the relationship that our brands are building with their traveling customers can provide an opportunity for us to offer a value to them while they're in destination, and you may have seen a release about the Booking.com experiences in a few cities where they're testing a program to provide access to attractions and so forth to their customers. And from our perspective, that provides a real opportunity to build a deeper relationship with the customer if they're interacting with your product while they're traveling, while they're in destination. And because we have that connection and the data around their travel, where they're going, when they're going, et cetera, and in many cases, the customer is traveling with one of their -- one of our apps on their mobile device, we continue to be very, very interested in that opportunity. I think the -- specifically, with respect to OpenTable, we also remain convinced that, that logic applies to dining and that travelers are all dining when they're on their trip and that we've got an opportunity to provide content, reservation-making ability to those travelers. But we have an appreciation of the challenges inherent in doing that. And I think that those learnings will definitely inform us with respect to future acquisitions, but I don't think they're necessarily going to discourage us from considering them or ultimately doing them. We -- but we do have a better appreciation of the challenges of making those connections with our existing brands."
