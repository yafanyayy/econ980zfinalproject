I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3 then I'll review guidance for Q4, and I'll provide some color even on Q1, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comment.
As you can imagine, we are pleased with this quarter. Total revenue was inside my guidance, driven by the fantastic performance of our SaaS, PaaS business, which was well beyond the high end of my guidance. Earnings per share was $0.01 above the high end of my guidance, even with the currency headwind being $0.01 worse than expected. 
Q3 currency headwinds were largely as expected, around 4% in most categories, including total revenue. But as I just said, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.01 worse than expected at $0.04 more than instead of the $0.03 I guided to. We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. 
I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business where we continue to see excellent momentum. Bookings grew 77% this quarter, and that's on top of the 129% we recorded last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $585 million, up 60% from last year. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 21%, with PaaS up more than 150% sequentially and our data as a service business continuing to take off. 
Our sustained SaaS, PaaS bookings growth is now translating into a significant acceleration of our SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. And in Q4, we could see double-digit sequential revenue growth again. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $1.1 billion and was up 96% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings were 32% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 2% to $152 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will be much -- will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth will be more moderate for now as it is currently dominated by our hosting business. 
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS and PaaS revenue as well as Infrastructure as a Service revenue, were $737 million, up 43% from last year. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. 
The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 51%, up from 43% last quarter and we will see further improvement in Q4. And from there, we will be targeting 80% over time. On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.3 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year as customers continue to direct new spend to Oracle cloud services.
Over this fiscal year, I expect constant currency on-premise software revenue will be positive, comprised of continued growth in software support that offsets declines in new software license. Finally, total hardware revenue was down 8%, which included hardware products revenue of $604 million and hardware support revenue of $531 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 1% at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion and the operating margin was 42%. I continue to believe, assuming no more wild currency swings, that this fiscal year, that's FY '16, the one we're in, will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, and the GAAP tax rate was 21.6% as we saw some catch-up benefit largely related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 in USD and GAAP EPS was $0.50 in USD. As I mentioned before, had the dollar not strengthened, the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.04 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $368 million, with just a bit over 15% being cloud-related. And I expect that cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be dramatically lower than last year as we utilize the investments that had been made. 
Now the non-cloud CapEx was dominated by real estate, led by the Austin, Texas campus we are building to support our cloud sales organization as well as moving and consolidating teams and other lines of business currently in other locations.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. We now have nearly $51 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is nearly $11 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.9 billion, up 11% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 61 million shares for a total of $2.2 billion, and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion. The board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, share repurchases have totaled $10.5 billion, and we have paid out $2.6 billion in dividends for a total that is nearly 120% of our free cash flow.
Now before I turn to guidance, as many of you know, the move to cloud is a generational shift in technology that is the biggest and most important opportunity in our company's history. We embarked on this transformation over 10 years ago when we began rewriting all of our software to enable our customers to leverage our solutions as cloud solutions. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with more than 11,000 of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their business.
We ourself have been going through an operational transformation, which I'll actually be sharing more of in our in-house townhall that we'll be having for our own employees later today. But we are really aiming to be the easiest company in the business to do business with. And you're going to see some very good positive changes that we think our customers will love.
Now as I said, we're not quite at the end of the beginning as we're actively working to transform our entire business but I think you're going to see the results. And we are far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth. 
We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you the guidance for Q4 and then some preliminary comments for Q1. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, but I'm going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of about 2% on revenue and about $0.02 on EPS. 
So on to the guidance. For Q4, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 57% to 61%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow negative 1% to positive 3%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 1% and 2%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from negative 2% to positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.82 and $0.85, up from $0.78 last quarter -- last Q4, depending on the mix of the revenues and tax rates.
Looking further out for Q1, SaaS and PaaS revenue growth should be higher than the 59% midpoint of my Q4 guidance. SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to be higher than Q4 gross margins. Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth should be very solid. I will revisit Q1 with you as part of the Q4 earnings call in June.
With that, I'd turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue than any other company in the world, including Salesforce.com. We're growing much faster than Salesforce.com, more than twice as fast. 
Because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS markets than they do, we compete directly with Salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS Customer Experience market, including sales, service and marketing. But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets where Salesforce.com does not compete at all such as ERP and HCM. 
It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud, including Fusion Financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing and much, much more. That long effort is now paying off. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the enterprise cloud ERP market. We have more than 10x the number of customers than Workday. I should say we have more than 10x the number of ERP customers than Workday. And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM. Salesforce.com is missing all of that ERP market opportunity. 
The breadth of our ERP, HCM and CRM SaaS product portfolio, combined with the technical superiority of our underlying SaaS cloud services, should enable us to sustain our rapid cloud growth for a long period of time. And that, in turn, should make it easy for Oracle to pass Salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS cloud company in the world. With that, I'll pass it on to Marc."

I'm going to do my best again but some information out to you even with my voice as it is. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue of 96%, as Safra mentioned, is growing 3x the rate of Salesforce and twice the rate of Workday. We booked $310 million in ARR in the quarter, 77% CE growth in Q3, up sequentially from 75%. Our PaaS bookings were $106 million in USD. 
Our pipeline is huge in SaaS, PaaS. We're on track for a $1.5 billion of ARR bookings for the year. Customer counts. SaaS. We had 942 new SaaS customers in the quarter. Over half were Fusion wins. We had 783 customer expansions in the quarter, an all-time high. Our installed base of SaaS customers is now 11,000. 
CX, we had 465 customer wins in Q3, more than 500 expansions. HCM, 213 new customers in Q3. Over the past 2 years, we had nearly doubled the number of customers of Workday. And we are seeing a lot of Workday defections. In ERP, 334 customers in Q3. 175 did not have Oracle on-prem apps before they bought. 
We are clearly taking share. Our installed base is now well over 1,800 customers. Together, Fusion HCM and ERP had more go-lives in the last 6 quarters than Workday's lifetime total. And I would like to use the word competition for ERP customers between us and Workday. It is a slaughter.
Go-lives in the quarter, we had -- closing in on 1,500 customers that are now live on Fusion. Our Q3 was our best go-live quarter ever. In PaaS, we at 1,143 new PaaS customers. Our installed base now has nearly 5,000 customers. Now while that's a big number from starting from 0, it's still an enormous opportunity with 310,000 on-prem database customers. This business is going to be extremely large for us. Our renewals continued to improve. Our renewal rates were higher than previous year. 
Now I'm going to give you a few customer wins just so you have some context of names and brands in the quarter that committed to our solutions. In Fusion HCM Cloud, I'm going to read out some names. 
Acosta, Adventist Health, Blue Shield of California, Cooperative Group, Generali, RealNetworks, Sisters of Charity Health System, Supervalu, TechNet, Vanderbilt University, Yum Brands.
ERP, Adventist Health, American Institute of Physics, Bluebird Bio, Boston Market, Culinary Institute of America, Cal State University, Dresser-Rand, Harvard Medical Facility, Japan Airlines, Orange in France, Supervalu, Scholastic, Sun Edison, Vanderbilt University, the University of Kansas, Velcro, Yum Brands. 
In Sales Cloud: Adventist Health, Cigna, GE Intelligent Systems, Kaiser Permanente, LEGO, Omron, RealNetworks, Sun Corp., Telecom Italia Brazil, Travelport, Italia. 
In Marketing Cloud: AIG, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canon, Citigroup, Clinton Foundation, Coach, Dish, Forever 21, Kelly Services, Landmark Group, Lego Company, MorningStar, Nestlé, Princess Cruises, Snapfish, Vodafone.
Now I only name those and you heard many names mentioned multiple times, and I did that on purpose so you understand some of the cross-pillar opportunities that exist as we go forward, that when we see the connection rate between -- we see the connection rate between ERP and HCM, Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, which we think are amazing opportunities going forward. As Larry described, we are the only one in the market with the breadth of portfolio that we have today.

And what you really have to track is the relative growth rates in each quarter, and obviously, our expectation that we'll have a strong Q4. As I said before and I'm going to reiterate again, we're going to do nothing but just get better and better at this business. We have obviously a large quantity of people in the sales force. We staffed our sales force 2 or 3 years ago. We have trained them. We've now trained them multiple times. We now have references, not only deals that we have closed but as I mentioned, our go-lives are now scaled up.

That would be fabulous. Now do we expect many of them? Many of them clearly are doing it, but we have such an enormous installed base that some of them will put new applications in the cloud or different test and development in the cloud or a combination or a hybrid. But we would be delighted. You should think about it as if our customers move to the cloud, that means that they not only, of course, pay us for the software, but we also offer them a service where we own hardware and we manage and we do all the labor. And so even though they end up paying us more than they would have historically just for support license, a support fee, but they themselves, our customers, end up spending a lot less in total because of the massive economies of scale we have in running the Oracle Database for them that they would not have on their own. So it would be delightful if they all moved. But -- and some are moving and many are moving, which is wonderful. But I think this will take quite a long time. And some will stay on-premise indefinitely and that's entirely their choice."

So is it fair to assume that cannibalization is happening at a more aggressive rate than when Mark last gave us some numbers on it. I think Mark at Oracle OpenWorld, you said, that I think at that point, 0.8% of the maintenance for SaaS transition to cloud. And then on the cloud side, I believe you're seeing some of your first renewals of deals that were likely signed early on amidst like significant promotions and attractive rates. So I think the consensus or at least my assumption would be that those renewal rates would be pretty low. But I think you just said that you're seeing good renewal rates even better than you had seen. So I just wonder if you could comment on that. So one, cannibalization; and second, cloud renewals."

John, I would tell you that as good as our renewal rates are, they will get materially better. So the first sets of Fusion HCM, Fusion ERP, those numbers, while you're right, they are off promotions. They are not yet to a renewal stage. So -- our stickiest, think of it as our stickiest applications, which will drive very, very, very high renewal rates are not yet baked into the now very high and improving renewal numbers that we've got. So that's your second question. To your first question, we listen to your point, we're making that trade every day. If we can trade license for cloud, that's what we're doing. And so to your point, yes, you saw a more momentum in the cloud business then probably you have modeled, and we look at that as great. And so that's what we're continuing to focus on is continuing to drive movement to the cloud. And if we do, we get remodel this out again at OpenWorld, that means more money for us, more revenue for us will run. So when we can get a booking, a choice of a booking, maybe as good [indiscernible] one more time. If we get $1 of booking cloud and $1 of booking in license, the next year, we get the support on the license. The next year, that $1 we get as a booking, we get another $1 of revenue.

We're 10x bigger than they are. Now in HCM, I [indiscernible] what to tell you. I can give you a few brands. I mean, there's Southwestern Energy. They had Workday and stopped their Workday implementation and used Oracle. Fannie Mae used Workday, no longer does and now uses Oracle. Archaos, they used Workday and they used Workday in the U.S. They went to a global decision for HR, decided on Oracle and replaced their Workday implementation in the U.S. MoneyGram started off implementing Workday. It didn't go well, reevaluated and now have Oracle HCM Cloud as their core HR for their enterprise. Same thing is true is that Molina Healthcare. One of the first implementations of Workday, I think, that was in Asia Pacific was CMiC in Australia. They now stopped their Workday implementation, removed it and installed Oracle HCM. Genesis, who's a technology provider here in the valley. They implemented Workday, stopped, threw it out and are implementing Oracle HCM. Brightsource switched to Oracle upon renewal opportunity for HCM with Workday. So I mean, California positions -- Safra has given me to stop. But listen, this is just -- I get all this stuff. I hear all this rhetoric, and I'm just trying to give it. These are like real companies that said, ""We're going to stop and we're going to go do -- we're going to go implement Oracle HCM."" And so that's what I see going into the market. And that's why I continue to read offbrand names, so we can get away from words and rhetoric and get down to what's really happening. So the numbers in ERP are what they are. The names in HCM and let's just -- I mean, let's go back to customer counts. They're real customers. I mean, who -- what -- you can do the extrapolation, I know you do, of how many customers that. D new in the marketplace versus how many new we're getting in the marketplace.

We have an incredible -- by the way, I can tell you Kirk, you realize quickly why you don't want to get into this cloud business because the barriers to entry are extremely, you want to go global. Many of these customers want to know their data is in their country. And that's much of the CapEx we invested a couple of years ago that we put in, and that's a big advantage for us.

As you can imagine, we are pleased with this quarter. Total revenue was inside my guidance, driven by the fantastic performance of our SaaS, PaaS business, which was well beyond the high end of my guidance. Earnings per share was $0.01 above the high end of my guidance, even with the currency headwind being $0.01 worse than expected. 
Q3 currency headwinds were largely as expected, around 4% in most categories, including total revenue. But as I just said, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.01 worse than expected at $0.04 more than instead of the $0.03 I guided to. We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. 
I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business where we continue to see excellent momentum. Bookings grew 77% this quarter, and that's on top of the 129% we recorded last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $585 million, up 60% from last year. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 21%, with PaaS up more than 150% sequentially and our Data as  Service business continuing to take off. 
Our sustained SaaS, PaaS bookings growth is now translating into significant acceleration of our SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. And in Q4, we could see double-digit sequential revenue growth again. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.1 billion and was up 96% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings were 32% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 2% to $152 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will be much -- will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth will be more moderate for now as it is currently dominated by our hosting business. 
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS and PaaS revenue as well as Infrastructure as a Service revenue, were $737 million, up 43% from last year. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. 
The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 51%, up from 43% last quarter and we will see further improvement in Q4. And from there, we will be targeting 80% over time. On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.3 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year as customers continue to direct new spend to Oracle cloud services.
Over this fiscal year, I expect constant currency on-premise software revenue will be positive, comprised of continued growth in software support that offsets decline in new software license. Finally, total hardware revenue was down 8%, which included hardware products revenue of $604 million and hardware support revenue of $531 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 1% at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion and the operating margin was 42%. I continue to believe, assuming no more wild currency swings, that this fiscal year, that's FY '16, the one we're in, will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, and the GAAP tax rate was 21.6% as we saw some catch-up benefit largely related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.64 and GAAP EPS was USD 0.50. As I mentioned before, had the dollar not strengthened, the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.04 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $368 million, with just a bit over 15% being cloud related. And I expect that cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be dramatically lower than last year as we utilize the investments that had been made. 
Now the non-cloud CapEx was dominated by real estate, led by the Austin, Texas, campus we are building to support our cloud sales organization as well as moving and consolidating teams and other lines of business currently in other locations.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. We now have nearly $51 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is nearly $11 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.9 billion, up 11% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 61 million shares for a total of $2.2 billion, and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion. The board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, share repurchases have totaled $10.5 billion, and we have paid out $2.6 billion in dividends for a total that is nearly 120% of our free cash flow.
Now before I turn to guidance, as many of you know, the move to cloud is a generational shift in technology that is the biggest and most important opportunity in our company's history. We embarked on this transformation over 10 years ago, when we began rewriting all of our software to enable our customers to leverage our solutions as cloud solutions. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with more than 11,000 of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their business.
We ourself have been going through an operational transformation, which I'll actually be sharing more of in our in-house town hall that we'll be having for our own employees later today. But we are really aiming to be the easiest company in the business to do business with. And you're going to see some very good positive changes that we think our customers will love.
Now as I said, we're not quite at the end of the beginning as we're actively working to transform our entire business, but I think you're going to see the results. To this end, we are far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth. 
We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you the guidance for Q4 and then some preliminary comments for Q1. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate, but I'm going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of about 2% on revenue and about $0.02 on EPS. 
So on to the guidance. For Q4, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 57% to 61%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow negative 1% to positive 3%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 1% and 2%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from negative 2% to positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.82 and $0.85, up from $0.78 last quarter -- last Q4, depending on the mix of the revenues and tax rates.
Looking further out for Q1, SaaS and PaaS revenue growth should be higher than the 59%, midpoint of my Q4 guidance. SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to be higher than Q4 gross margins. Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth should be very solid. I will revisit Q1 with you as part of the Q4 earnings call in June.
With that, I'd turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue than any other company in the world, including Salesforce.com. We're growing much faster than Salesforce.com, more than twice as fast. 
Because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS markets than they do, we compete directly with Salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS customer experience market, including sales, service and marketing. But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets, where Salesforce.com does not compete at all such as ERP and HCM. 
It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud, including Fusion financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing and much, much more. That long effort is now paying off. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the enterprise cloud ERP market. We have more than 10x the number of customers than Workday. I should say we have more than 10x the number of ERP customers than Workday. And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM. Salesforce.com is missing all of that ERP market opportunity. 
The breadth of our ERP, HCM and CRM SaaS product portfolio, combined with the technical superiority of our underlying SaaS cloud services, should enable us to sustain our rapid cloud growth for a long period of time. And that, in turn, should make it easy for Oracle to pass Salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS cloud company in the world. With that, I'll pass it on to Mark."

I'm going to do my best to get some information out to you though even with my voice as it is. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue of 96%, as Safra mentioned, is growing 3x the rate of Salesforce and twice the rate of Workday. We booked $310 million in ARR in the quarter, 77% CD growth in Q3, up sequentially from 75%. Our PaaS bookings were USD 106 million. 
Our pipeline is huge in SaaS, PaaS. We're on track for a $1.5 billion of ARR bookings for the year. Customer counts. SaaS. We had 942 new SaaS customers in the quarter. Over half were Fusion wins. We had 783 customer expansions in the quarter, an all-time high. Our installed base of SaaS customers is now 11,000. 
CX, we had 465 customer wins in Q3, more than 500 expansions. HCM, 213 new customers in Q3. Over the past 2 years, we had nearly doubled the number of customers of Workday. And we are seeing a lot of Workday defections. In ERP, 334 customers in Q3. 175 did not have Oracle on-prem apps before they bought. 
We are clearly taking share. Our installed base is now well over 1,800 customers. Together, Fusion HCM and ERP had more go-lives in the last 6 quarters than Workday's lifetime total. And I would like to use the word in the competition for ERP customers between us and Workday, it is a slaughter.
Go-lives in the quarter, we had -- closing in on 1,500 customers that are now live on Fusion. Our Q3 was our best go-live quarter ever. In PaaS, we have 1,143 new PaaS customers. Our installed base now has nearly 5,000 customers. While that's a big number from starting from 0, it's still an enormous opportunity with 310,000 on-prem database customers. This business is going to be extremely large for us. Our renewals continued to improve. Our renewal rates were higher than previous year. 
Now I'm going to give you a few customer wins just so you have some context of names and brands in the quarter that committed to our solutions. In Fusion HCM Cloud, I'm going to read out some names. 
Acosta [ph], Adventist Health, Blue Shield of California, Cooperative Group, Generali, RealNetworks, Sisters of Charity Health System, Supervalu, Technip, Vanderbilt University, Yum! Brands.

In Marketing Cloud: AIG, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canon, Citigroup, Clinton Foundation, Coach, Dish, Forever 21, Kelly Services, Landmark Group, Lego Company, Morningstar, Nestlé, Princess Cruises, Snapfish, Vodafone.
Now I only name those and you heard many names mentioned multiple times, and I did that on purpose so you understand some of the cross-pillar opportunities that exist as we go forward, that when we see the connection rate between -- we see the connection rate between ERP and HCM, Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, which we think are amazing opportunities going forward.

We staffed our sales force 2 or 3 years ago. We have trained them. We've now trained them multiple times. We now have references, not only deals that we have closed, but as I mentioned, our go-lives are now scaled up.

And then on the cloud side, I believe you're seeing some of your first renewals of deals that were likely signed early on amidst like significant promotions and attractive rates. So I think the consensus assumption or at least my assumption would be that those renewal rates would be pretty low. But I think you just said that you're seeing good renewal rates even better than you had seen. So I just wonder if you can comment on that. So one, cannibalization; and second, cloud renewals."

They were up -- I think I made the statement at last quarter that they were up almost 500 basis points. So that would just give you some idea of our year-to-year improvement in renewals. John, I would tell you that as good as our renewal rates are, they will get materially better. So the first sets of Fusion HCM, Fusion ERP, those numbers, while you're right, they are off promotions. They are not yet to a renewal stage. So -- our stickiest, think of it as our stickiest applications, which will drive very, very, very high renewal rates are not yet baked into the now very high and improving renewal numbers that we've got. So that's your second question. To your first question, we listen to your point, we're making that trade every day. If we can trade license for cloud, that's what we're doing. And so to your point, yes, you saw a more momentum in the cloud business than probably you have modeled, and we look at that as great. And so that's what we're continuing to focus on, is continuing to drive movement to the cloud. And if we do, we get -- we model this out again at OpenWorld, that means more money for us, more revenue for us long run. So when we can get a booking, a choice of a booking, maybe as good to discuss this one more time. If we get $1 of booking cloud and $1 of booking in license, the next year, we get the support on the license. The next year, that $1 we get as a booking, we get another $1 of revenue. So the fact that you see those dollars shift, that is an absolute good thing for us, John."

Now in HCM, I feel I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I can give you a few brands. I mean, there's Southwestern Energy. They had Workday and stopped their Workday implementation and used Oracle. Fannie Mae used Workday, no longer does and now uses Oracle. [indiscernible], they used Workday and they use Workday in the U.S. They went to a global decision for HR, decided on Oracle and replaced their Workday implementation in the U.S. MoneyGram started off implementing Workday. It didn't go well, reevaluated and now have Oracle HCM Cloud as their core HR for their enterprise. Same thing true is at Molina Healthcare. One of the first implementations of Workday, I think, that was in Asia Pacific was at CMiC in Australia. They now stopped their Workday implementation, removed it and installed Oracle HCM. Genesis, who's a technology provider here in the valley, they implemented Workday, stopped, threw it out and are implementing Oracle HCM. BrightSource switched to Oracle upon renewal opportunity for HCM with Workday. So I mean, California positions -- Safra has given me to stop. But listen, this is just -- I get all this stuff. I hear all this rhetoric, and I'm just trying to give you. These are like real companies that said, ""We're going to stop and we're going to go do -- we're going to go implement Oracle HCM."" And so that's what I see going in the market. And that's why I continue to read off-brand names so we can get away from words and rhetoric and get down to what's really happening. So I feel the numbers in ERP are what they are. The names in HCM and let's just -- I mean, let's go back to customer counts. They're real customers. I mean, who -- what -- you can do the extrapolation, I know you do, of how many customers that they are getting new in the marketplace versus how many new we're getting in the marketplace. And so again, I'd like to just put the names and the numbers speak for themselves. So that's my answer, Phil."

Many of those are beginning to go away. Now certainly some of that has been the fact that we now have built out over the past couple of years data center infrastructure in so many locations. We have an incredible -- by the way, I can tell you, Kirk, you realize quickly why you don't want to get into this cloud business because the barriers to entry are extreme when you want to go global. Many of these customers want to know their data is in their country. And that's much of the CapEx we invested a couple of years ago that we put in and that's a big advantage for us. Most of our competitors don't have that infrastructure deployed around the world that we now do. To your point, we also have a very scaled distribution capability in all of those countries. And I think you have this growing acceptance of cloud at both the SaaS and PaaS layer that -- I don't have a metric on it. I can just tell you that the acceptance level up. I'm now going to do my dev test in the cloud, and I'm talking about this happening in Korea, in Australia, in Brazil is now a regular conversation on all of our customer base.

And then there is, if you will, the Infrastructure as a Service PaaS market where they're running virtually any custom application they wrote on top of our database Platform as a Service. Those are both enormous markets. And we're really strongly in the first competing with people at Workday and Salesforce.com.

And there our become competitor won't be the Salesforce's and the Workday's. The big competitor will be Amazon.com, but we're going to play -- we are playing in both of those markets and PaaS will grow driven by SaaS and PaaS will also grow driven by Infrastructure as a Service.

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3, then I'll review guidance for Q4, and I'll provide some color even on Q1, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are pleased with this quarter. Total revenue was inside my guidance, driven by the fantastic performance of our SaaS, PaaS business, which was well beyond the high end of my guidance. Earnings per share was $0.01 above the high end of my guidance, even with the currency headwind being $0.01 worse than expected. 
Q3 currency headwinds were largely as expected, around 4% in most categories, including total revenue. But as I just said, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.01 worse than expected at $0.04 more than instead of the $0.03 I guided to. We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. 
I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business where we continue to see excellent momentum. Bookings grew 77% this quarter, and that's on top of the 129% we recorded last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $585 million, up 60% from last year. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 21%, with PaaS up more than 150% sequentially and our Data as a Service business continuing to take off. 
Our sustained SaaS, PaaS bookings growth is now translating into significant acceleration of our SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. And in Q4, we could see double-digit sequential revenue growth again. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.1 billion and was up 96% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 32% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 2% to $152 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenues will be much -- will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth will be more moderate for now as it is currently dominated by our hosting business. 
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS and PaaS revenue as well as Infrastructure as a Service revenue, were $737 million, up 43% from last year. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. 
The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 51%, up from 43% last quarter and we will see further improvement in Q4. And from there, we will be targeting 80% over time. On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.3 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year as customers continue to direct new spend to Oracle cloud services.
Over this fiscal year, I expect constant currency on-premise software revenue will be positive, comprised of continued growth in software support that offsets decline in new software license. Finally, total hardware revenue was down 8%, which included hardware products revenue of $604 million and hardware support revenue of $531 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 1% at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion and the operating margin was 42%. I continue to believe, assuming no more wild currency swings, that this fiscal year, that's FY '16, the one we're in, will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, and the GAAP tax rate was 21.6% as we saw some catch-up benefit largely related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.64 and GAAP EPS was USD 0.50. As I mentioned before, had the dollar not strengthened, the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.04 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $368 million, with just a bit over 15% being cloud related. And I expect that cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be dramatically lower than last year as we utilize the investments that had been made. 
Now the non-cloud CapEx was dominated by real estate, led by the Austin, Texas, campus we are building to support our cloud sales organization as well as moving and consolidating teams and other lines of business currently in other locations.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. We now have nearly $51 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is nearly $11 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.9 billion, up 11% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 61 million shares for a total of $2.2 billion, and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion. The board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, share repurchases have totaled $10.5 billion, and we have paid out $2.6 billion in dividends for a total that is nearly 120% of our free cash flow.
Now before I turn to guidance, as many of you know, the move to cloud is a generational shift in technology that is the biggest and most important opportunity in our company's history. We embarked on this transformation over 10 years ago, when we began rewriting all of our software to enable our customers to leverage our solutions as cloud solutions. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with more than 11,000 of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their business.
We ourself have been going through an operational transformation, which I'll actually be sharing more of in our in-house town hall that we'll be having for our own employees later today. But we are really aiming to be the easiest company in the business to do business with. And you're going to see some very good positive changes that we think our customers will love.
Now as I said, we're not quite at the end of the beginning as we're actively working to transform our entire business, but I think you're going to see the results. To this end, we are far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth. 
We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you the guidance for Q4 and then some preliminary comments for Q1. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate, but I'm going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of about 2% on revenue and about $0.02 on EPS. 
So on to the guidance. For Q4, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 57% to 61%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow negative 1% to positive 3%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 1% and 2%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from negative 2% to positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.82 and $0.85, up from $0.78 last quarter -- last Q4, depending on the mix of the revenues and tax rates.
Looking further out for Q1, SaaS and PaaS revenue growth should be higher than the 59%, midpoint of my Q4 guidance. SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to be higher than Q4 gross margins. Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth should be very solid. I will revisit Q1 with you as part of the Q4 earnings call in June.
With that, I'd turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue than any other company in the world, including Salesforce.com. We're growing much faster than Salesforce.com, more than twice as fast. 
Because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS markets than they do, we compete directly with Salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS customer experience market, including sales, service and marketing. But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets, where Salesforce.com does not compete at all such as ERP and HCM. 
It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud, including Fusion financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing and much, much more. That long effort is now paying off. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the enterprise cloud ERP market. We have more than 10x the number of customers than Workday. I should say we have more than 10x the number of ERP customers than Workday. And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM. Salesforce.com is missing all of that ERP market opportunity. 
The breadth of our ERP, HCM and CRM SaaS product portfolio, combined with the technical superiority of our underlying PaaS cloud services, should enable us to sustain our rapid cloud growth for a long period of time. And that, in turn, should make it easy for Oracle to pass Salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS cloud company in the world. With that, I'll pass it on to Mark."

I'm going to do my best to get some information out to you though even with my voice as it is. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue of 96%, that Safra mentioned, is growing 3x the rate of Salesforce and twice the rate of Workday. We booked $310 million in ARR in the quarter, 77% CD growth in Q3, up sequentially from 75%. Our PaaS bookings were USD 106 million. 
Our pipeline is huge in SaaS, PaaS. We're on track for a $1.5 billion of ARR bookings for the year. Customer counts. SaaS. We had 942 new SaaS customers in the quarter. Over half were Fusion wins. We had 783 customer expansions in the quarter, an all-time high. Our installed base of SaaS customers is now 11,000. 
CX, we had 465 customer wins in Q3, more than 500 expansions. HCM, 213 new customers in Q3. Over the past 2 years, we have nearly doubled the number of customers of Workday. And we are seeing lots of Workday defections. In ERP, 334 customers in Q3. 175 did not have Oracle on-prem apps before they bought. 
We are clearly taking share. Our installed base is now well over 1,800 customers. Together, Fusion HCM and ERP had more go-lives in the last 6 quarters than Workday's lifetime total. And I would like to use the word in the competition for ERP customers between us and Workday, it is a slaughter.
Go-lives in the quarter, we had -- closing in on 1,500 customers that are now live on Fusion. Our Q3 was our best go-live quarter ever. In PaaS, we had 1,143 new PaaS customers. Our installed base now has nearly 5,000 customers. While that's a big number from starting from 0, it's still an enormous opportunity with 310,000 on-prem database customers. This business is going to be extremely large for us. Our renewals continued to improve. Our renewal rates were higher than previous year. 
Now I'm going to give you a few customer wins just so you have some context of names and brands in the quarter that committed to our solutions. In Fusion HCM Cloud, I'm going to read off some names. 
Acosta [ph], Adventist Health, Blue Shield of California, Cooperative Group, Generali, RealNetworks, Sisters of Charity Health System, Supervalu, Technip, Vanderbilt University, Yum! Brands.

In Marketing Cloud: AIG, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canon, Citigroup, Clinton Foundation, Coach, Dish, Forever 21, Kelly Services, Landmark Group, Lego Company, Morningstar, Nestlé, Princess Cruises, Quicken Loans, Snapfish, Vodafone.
Now I only name those for you and you heard many names mentioned multiple times, and I did that on purpose so you understand some of the cross-pillar opportunities that exist as we go forward, that when we see the connection rate between -- we see the connection rate between ERP and HCM, Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, which we think are amazing opportunities going forward. As Larry described, we are the only one in the market with the breadth of portfolio that we have today.

We now have references, not only deals that we have closed, but as I mentioned, our go-lives are now scaled up.

We see our customers with literally millions of applications and millions of users on those applications built on top of the Oracle Database wanting to move those applications into the cloud. And we do that very well. Our PaaS service is even easier to use and better than Oracle is on-premise. So we see the next generation of our database business predominantly in the cloud, though we still sell an awful lot of that software on-premise. The beauty of what we offer is the same exact database experience on-premise and in the cloud and the ability for our customers to move a workload from on-premise and into the cloud and move data from on-premise into the cloud with a push of a button. That's something that Microsoft can't offer. We have a huge installed base that wants to migrate to the cloud, but still wants to have an on-premise infrastructure. And we provide graceful compatibility and coexistence with what's in your data center and what's in the cloud as you begin that decade-long migration to the cloud.

John, I would tell you that as good as our renewal rates are, they will get materially better. So the first sets of Fusion HCM, Fusion ERP, those numbers, while you're right, they are off promotions. They are not yet to a renewal stage. So -- our stickiest, think of it as our stickiest applications, which will drive very, very, very high renewal rates are not yet baked into the now very high and improving renewal numbers that we've got. So that's your second question. To your first question, I mean listen to your point, we're making that trade every day. If we can trade license for cloud, that's what we're doing. And so to your point, yes, you saw a more momentum in the cloud business than probably you had modeled, and we look at that as great. And so that's what we're continuing to focus on, is continuing to drive movement to the cloud. And if we do, we get -- we model this out again at OpenWorld, that means more money for us, more revenue for us long run. So when we can get a booking, a choice of a booking, maybe it's good to just go through this one more time. If we get $1 of booking in cloud and $1 of booking in license, the next year, we get the support on the license. The next year, that $1 we get as a booking, we get another $1 of revenue.

Now in HCM, Phil, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I can give you a few brands. I mean, there's Southwestern Energy. They had Workday and stopped their Workday implementation and used Oracle. Fannie Mae used Workday, no longer does and now uses Oracle. [indiscernible], they used Workday and they use Workday in the U.S. They went to a global decision for HR, decided on Oracle and replaced their Workday implementation in the U.S. MoneyGram started off implementing Workday. It didn't go well, reevaluated and now have Oracle HCM Cloud as their core HR for their enterprise. Same thing is true at Molina Healthcare. One of the first implementations of Workday, I think, that was in Asia Pacific was at CMiC in Australia. They now stopped their Workday implementation, removed it and installed Oracle HCM. Genesis, who's a technology provider here in the valley, they implemented Workday, stopped, threw it out and are implementing Oracle HCM. BrightSource switched to Oracle upon renewal opportunity for HCM with Workday. So I mean, California Physicians -- Safra giving me the stop. But listen, this is just -- I get all this stuff. I hear all this rhetoric, and I'm just trying to give you. These are like real companies that said, ""We're going to stop and we're going to go do -- we're going to go implement Oracle HCM."" And so that's what I see going in the market. And that's why I continue to read off brand names so we can get away from words and rhetoric and get down to what's really happening. So -- Phil the numbers in ERP are what they are. The names in HCM and let's just -- I mean, let's go back to customer counts. I mean real customers. I mean, who -- what -- you can do the extrapolation, I know you do, of how many customers that they are getting new in the marketplace versus how many new we're getting in the marketplace. And so again, I'd like to just let the names and the numbers speak for themselves. So that's my answer, Phil."

It used to be -- 3, 4 years ago, when I was talking about cloud in Europe, I would get incredible amounts of resistance to issues around security, data sovereignty, et cetera.

We have an incredible -- by the way, I can tell you, Kirk, you realize quickly why you don't want to get into this cloud business because the barriers to entry are extreme when you want to go global. Many of these customers want to know their data is in their country. And that's much of the CapEx we invested a couple of years ago that we put in and that's a big advantage for us. Most of our competitors don't have that infrastructure deployed around the world that we now do. To your point, we also have a very scaled distribution capability in all of those countries. And I think you have this growing acceptance of cloud at both the SaaS and PaaS layer that -- I don't have a metric on it. I can just tell you that the acceptance level up. I'm now going to do my dev test in the cloud, and I'm talking about this happening in Korea, in Australia, in Brazil is now a regular conversation on all of our customer base.

So we are just entering the pure Infrastructure as a Service market, which opens up another huge PaaS play for us. So I mean you really can think there are 2 markets. There's the SaaS PaaS market, which we're in now, where people are running our applications on top of our database. And then there is, if you will, the Infrastructure as a Service PaaS market where they're running virtually any custom application they wrote on top of our database Platform as a Service. Those are both enormous markets. And we're really strongly in the first competing with people like Workday and Salesforce.com. You will see us -- and that -- a bunch of our database customers are moving over. You'll see a bunch more database customers moving over when they compare our Platform as a Service with our Compute, which allows them to run virtually any application in our cloud much more efficiently, much more securely than anyplace else. And there our become competitor won't be the Salesforce's and the Workday's. The big competitor will be Amazon.com, but we're going to play -- we are playing in both of those markets and PaaS will grow driven by SaaS and PaaS will also grow driven by Infrastructure as a Service. Huge opportunities."

I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17 and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clear",1574,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone, I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17 and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
Clearly, we are thrilled with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically overachieved again in the cloud. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS, PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year '15 and now 52% in fiscal year '16. And not to get ahead of myself but we expect to see even higher SaaS, PaaS growth this year. We'll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected, with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high end of my guidance and up 17% sequentially. Now as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is 100% accurate and, if anything, slightly conservative. 
You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS Billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
And through there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we are now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way: revenue growth, deferred revenue growth and billings growth. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4, and we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17, and from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion, with software updates and product support revenue at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud.
Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was $0.66 in USD. Had currencies not moved, by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.
Now covering the full fiscal year. Total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 52%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-premise software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion as continued growth in software support offset cloud-related declines in new software license. So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS, PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year '17 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an on-premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business. And then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year.
For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion and operating income was $15.8 billion. And assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS were $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense. 
This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. 
Now before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customer's strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the Accelerated Buying Experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own Configure, Price, Quote product sales and service cloud. 
We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use quick-to-accept functionality for enterprise customers. And that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly 2/3 of our cloud deals were processed using the accelerated buying experience, and we saw quote-to-book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing, given we introduced the program in Q4 and sales people had very little time to get used to it. 
Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with thousands of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their businesses. We are far enough along that our financial statement will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth.
My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned with in the cloud. Now to my guidance. I'm going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year '17. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now if currency -- if current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenue but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformation, I'm definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad and I'm going to be a bit conservative in my outlook.
Even with that said, for Q1, I'm raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business. 
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support, is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter -- last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues, and of course, the tax rate. 
Over the full year for FY '17, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 52% in FY '16. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY '17 much higher than the 57% reported today as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier -- as I mentioned earlier, operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Larry."
22247,346343896,1000904,"Oracle Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2016",2016-06-16,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thank you very much, Safra.

In the fiscal year just started, FY '17, Oracle has 2 specific points of focus: first, we'd like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we're at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue. 
We're the second-largest SaaS company in the world now, and we think we can be the largest SaaS company. Pretty [indiscernible] by the time we get to $10 billion, we think we're going to be the first one there. Why do I think that's possible? One is we're already growing at a very high rate, much faster than our competitors. We've proven we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale? Safra pointed out something that's kind of shocking, but as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is. We're a major player in ERP and HCM. We're almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We're the #1 player in marketing. We're very competitive. We're #1 type, we're #1 in service, and we compete against Salesforce.com in sales automation. 
But in all of these areas we compete, salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company, is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions, they're growing their business but they're in the customer experience sales area. They don't compete in the largest category, which is ERP. 
Also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing. And we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider. And some of these mid-market companies can simply get in all Oracle footprint run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That's -- it's something that salesforce can't offer, and we think that's going to serve us very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rates, while we go for that to be first to $10 billion. Okay. That's one thing. So we want to be #1, we think we need to be #1. We think we will be #1 in SaaS and PaaS. 
Second major point of focus is that our generation 2 of our Infrastructure as a Service data center has been built and stocked with computers. And now we're beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers. Infrastructure as a Service is the third leg of Oracle's cloud strategy. SaaS we talked a lot of PaaS, we talked a lot about because those 2 businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle. 
So what's going on in Infrastructure as a Service? Well, we've had to move to -- we've learned a lot about this business. There's a huge amount of demand, by the way, for our Infrastructure as a Service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers, but even bigger amount of demand for Infrastructure as a Service from our database customers. Our database customers want to move their applications into our cloud, putting their database onto our Platform as a Service and then their applications, a lot of custom applications onto our Infrastructure as a Service. These compute things go together. 
And we built again the second-generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there. Lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors. And there's huge demand for it and we're now starting to bring customers into that. 
We think that's another very important driver to Oracle's overall growth. We're growing faster than SaaS, we're growing faster than PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in Infrastructure as a Service. We've made the investments. We have the right technology with our second-generation data centers. And we're very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of SaaS and Infrastructure as a Service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud. I'll turn it over to Mark."

So this comparison is or this number is against that comparison. In",556,"Thanks, Larry. Just a few more numbers and we'll take your questions. Cloud bookings over $600 million in USD. 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year, we grew more than 200%. So this comparison is or this number is against that comparison. 
In SaaS, roughly $350 million in USD bookings. In PaaS, over $250 million. Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So had some questions about, do we include renewals in our markets? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings, kept separate and right around 40 [ph] 
As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year. SaaS, PaaS revenue, we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in 3 years. That our business has gotten bigger. 
In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double digits. In data as a service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a Service had another breakout quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. [indiscernible] doubling quarter-on-quarter, our Database as a Service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter. 
Our SaaS, PaaS billings grew 48% in FY '16. Our SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra's point and I want to say it again, grew much faster than salesforce.com and Workday. 
Now I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we closed 1,640 new SaaS customers, nearly 2/3 were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions. That is an all-time high for us. 273 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connection point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on. 
Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers. In the quarter, we had almost 700 CX customers and 600 expansions. In HCM, 380 [ph] new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5x that what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure I didn't misspeak. It's 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY '16 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle app. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5x the installed base from last year. We had 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly 1,000 go-lives this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers.
In closing, this was a big year for us not only in revenue but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR. I'm going to make just a couple predictions for the new year. We had a big year in bookings in FY '16. We will have a bigger year in FY '17. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings and our revenue reported growth rates. 
Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY '17. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster. So with that, we'll take whatever questions that you might have."

The same thing in effect occurs when we get Database as a Service as well. With it comes all of the other services that come with it as well. In addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten to. We get now to a whole set of mid-market customers that frankly, we just didn't have an opportunity to sell to before because you have to have the data center, and you have computer and you have to have a staff, and so now, all of that TAM has expanded as well so it's a broader market we get to and a whole set of market share that comes with it."

So if you have, let's say your ERP application and its an Oracle ERP application, then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system. In a sense, you feel perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle, and then I'll put the data warehousing situation at Microsoft Azure. But if you actually look at the pricing of cloud pricing, the one part of cloud that's expensive is moving data out of data centers. That's one thing they charge you a lot of money for. And then that's in industry pricing the way it works. So moving data between data centers back and forth, back and forth between data centers can be quite expensive. So there is an advantage for our built-in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built-in advantage by offering our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data markets using that ERP data. So I think that gives us a very significant advantage, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. I'll go back to Infrastructure as a Service. Well, why should they -- why should anyone -- why should I just move to Amazon? I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they got Infrastructure as a Service. Well, because we handle the Oracle Database much better than Amazon does. We can run very large Oracle databases, we've run it both tolerantly. We just do it a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the -- they run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job we run it faster more reliably, more securely. [indiscernible] the database, the database and Oracle data center and the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application on the computer right next to that. That's higher performance, much lower cost because I'm not moving all this data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. You -- those things are going to be co-located. So we think we have some built-in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS making it very -- customers who want to get the infrastructure service, they're related. It really didn't for structure as a service from the same cloud supplier and in the same data center."

Our team has done a great job in cloud ops from a provisioning perspective, provisioning meaning we then sell more, we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and wide and then has another effect on revenue linearity. In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year. And that's better than we expected but it was good. It was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we had this continued set of not linear but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platforms of those are that not of subscription but just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things and no one thing was 80% of it, Kash, it was really all of those things together added up to the beat that you referenced. Your second question was the relative growth rates of the various businesses. I'd start with they're sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it. The question becomes degree of good.

Totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we've gotten.

I think you'll see early adoption in the cloud. I think cloud's going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customers.

So wonder if you can just comment on is there any changes to the comp program, the structure of the sales force or kind of what they're focused on this fiscal year, that would be great."

So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now, we've actually cleaned up a few things so I made some changes 3 or 4 years ago to which we called on what and there were some things that we've done that, I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes. But [indiscernible] on what size of accounts, et cetera, so there's a little bit of that but frankly not much else. We have made an investment, Phil, as I know you know in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplements it. And we continue to raise the bar for those teams. It is a lower cost of sale, it is a much modern -- more modern way of selling, and it is our primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB. And we continue to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools. We talked last -- I think last quarter about investment we made in Austin in the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that, Phil, more people, more support for that team, and they're actually calling higher in terms of the size of the accounts they called a very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, spending actually doesn't go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments. In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud call. That's just pure nonsense. If anything, we believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money. You sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry. And that's our model and that's what we've done. In terms of on-prem comp, in just applications, these are applications that are not RGBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some ""comp"" in the context as it relates to a license sale. But Phil, to understand today, in horizontal apps licenses, the majority -- the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP into an existing base, more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there's some noise about it, but I would describe this as a nonevent. By the way, I want to add because I just can't help myself. But as of today, we have all of our salespeople have a territory. They have a comp plan. They have a boss. And virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year, have today been trained on all of our newest offering. So I've had this goal and I talked about this for years that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year and instead of it taking forever [indiscernible] companies take a quarter, 4 months, 5 months to get all this done. Our objective has been that salespeople lead the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they've been trained on everything we've got. And I can tell you as we sit here today, that, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle Corporation."

Now that's come from where we've been over the past couple of years, but I don't know that I would describe that as a market phenomena. I'm just going to make my comment in the context of Oracle. I think our team in Asia, which we've recruited over the past 18 months, did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line. I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb. So very positive on Asia. I feel the same may in Europe. I mean, there's a mixed economy over in Europe. We don't actually talk about it much around here because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4. So I feel very good about it. I think that's the way I would describe things outside U.S. LAD, we continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD relative to the market, I think our team performed fantastic. Our movement to the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we have across our company. So -- and then you get to the U.S. and I think in applications are moved to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and it shows up in the maturity of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. I mean, there's some just very exciting movements. Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business. It is not a license business, it is a cloud business. North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings, platform bookings. And I would say I'd also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in RGBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our little hospitality business and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win in Pfizer in the quarter, and they have really kicked their competitor metadata pretty strong over the course of the year. And I'd like to publicly give them the credit for that. They've done a great job. So maybe more data than you wanted but that's my view going across the globe."

I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.Clear",1573,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone, I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are thrilled with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically overachieved again in the cloud. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS, PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year '15 and now 52% in fiscal year '16. And not to get ahead of myself but we expect to see even higher SaaS, PaaS growth this year. We'll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected, with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high end of my guidance and up 17% sequentially. Now as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is 100% accurate, and if anything, slightly conservative.
You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we are now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way: revenue growth, deferred revenue growth and billings growth. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4, and we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion, with software updates and product support revenue at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud.
Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was USD 0.66. Had currencies not moved, by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.
Now covering the full fiscal year. Total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 52%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-premise software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion as continued growth in software support offset cloud-related declines in new software license. So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS, PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year '17 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an on-premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business. And then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year.
For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion and operating income was $15.8 billion. And assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS were $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customers' strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the Accelerated Buying Experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own Configure, Price, Quote product sales and service cloud.
We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use quick-to-accept functionality for enterprise customers. And that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly 2/3 of our cloud deals were processed using the Accelerated Buying Experience, and we saw quote-to-book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing given we introduced the program in Q4 and sales people had very little time to get used to it.
Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with thousands of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their businesses. We are far enough along that our financial statement will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned with in the cloud.
Now to my guidance. I'm going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year '17. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now if currency -- if current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenue but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformation, I'm definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad, and I'm going to be a bit conservative in my outlook.
Even with that said, for Q1, I'm raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support, is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter -- last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues, and of course, the tax rate.
Over the full year for FY '17, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 52% in FY '16. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY '17 much higher than the 57% reported today as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier -- as I mentioned earlier, operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency.
And with that, I will turn it over to Larry."

In the fiscal year just started, FY '17, Oracle has 2 specific points of focus: first, we'd like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we're at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue.
We're the second-largest SaaS company in the world now, and we think we can be the largest SaaS company. Pretty -- by the time we get to $10 billion, we think we're going to be the first one there. Why do I think that's possible? One is we're already growing at a very high rate, much faster than our competitors. We've proven we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale? Safra pointed out something that's kind of shocking, but as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is. We're a major player in ERP and HCM. We're almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We're the #1 player in marketing. We're very competitive. We're #1 in type. We're #1 in service. And we compete against Salesforce.com in sales automation.
But in all of these areas we compete, Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company, is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions. They're growing their business, but they're in the customer experience sales area. They don't compete in the largest category, which is ERP. Also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing again. And we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider.
And some of these mid-market companies can simply get an all-Oracle footprint, run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That's -- it's something that Salesforce can't offer, and we think that's going to serve us very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rates while we go for that, to be first to $10 billion.
Okay. That's one thing. So we want to be #1. We think we need to be #1. We think we will be #1 in SaaS and PaaS.
Second major point of focus is that our generation 2 of our Infrastructure as a Service data center has been built and stocked with computers. And now we're beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers. Infrastructure as a Service is the third leg of Oracle's cloud strategy. Obviously, SaaS, we talk about a lot, and PaaS, we talk a lot about because those 2 businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle.
So what's going on in Infrastructure as a Service? Well, we've had to move to -- we've learned a lot about this business. There's a huge amount of demand, by the way, for our Infrastructure as a Service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers but even bigger amount of demand for Infrastructure as a Service from our database customers. Our database customers want to move their applications into our cloud, putting their database onto our Platform as a Service and then their applications, a lot of custom applications, onto our Infrastructure as a Service. These 2 things go together.
And we've built, again, the second-generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there. Lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors. And there's huge demand for it, and we're now starting to bring customers into that.
We think that's another very important driver to Oracle's overall growth. We're growing faster in SaaS. We're growing faster in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in Infrastructure as a Service. We've made the investments. We have the right technology with our second-generation data centers. And we're very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud.
I'll turn it over to Mark."

Just a few more numbers and we'll take your questions. Cloud bookings, over USD 600 million, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year, we grew more than 200%. So this comparison is -- or this number is against that comparison",558,"Okay. Thanks, Larry. Just a few more numbers and we'll take your questions. Cloud bookings, over USD 600 million, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year, we grew more than 200%. So this comparison is -- or this number is against that comparison. In SaaS, roughly USD 350 million bookings. In PaaS, over $250 million.
Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So we've had some questions about, do we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings, kept separate and are right around 40 [ph]. As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year.
SaaS, PaaS revenue, we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in 3 years. That's because our business has gotten bigger.
In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double digits. In Data as a Service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a Service had another breakout quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. Within doubling quarter-on-quarter, our Database as a Service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter. 
Our SaaS, PaaS billings grew 48% in FY '16. Our SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra's point, and I want to say it again, grew much faster than Salesforce.com and Workday.
Now I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we've closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly 2/3 were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions. That is an all-time high for us. 273 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connection point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on. Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers.
In the quarter, we had almost 700 CX customers and 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5x that what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure I didn't misspeak. It's 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY '16 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle app. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5x the installed base from last year. We had 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly 1,000 go-lives this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers.
In closing, this was a big year for us not only in revenue but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR.
I'm going to make just a couple predictions for the new year. We had a big year in bookings in FY '16. We will have a bigger year in FY '17. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings and our revenue reported growth rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY '17. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster.
So with that, we'll take whatever questions that you might have."

The same thing in effect occurs when we get Database as a Service as well. With it comes all of the other services that come with it as well. In addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten to.

So if you have, let's say, your ERP application and it's an Oracle ERP application, then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system. In a sense, you feel it's perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle, and then I'll put the data warehousing situation at Microsoft Azure. But if you actually look at the pricing, cloud pricing, the one part of cloud that's expensive is moving data out of data centers. That's one thing they charge you a lot of money for. And then that's the kind of industry pricing, the way it works. So moving data between data centers back and forth, back and forth between data centers can be quite expensive. So there is an advantage for our built-in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built-in advantage by offering our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data markets [ph] using that ERP data. So I think that gives us a very significant advantage, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. I'll go back to Infrastructure as a Service. Well, why should they -- why should anyone -- why should I just move to Amazon? I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they got Infrastructure as a Service. Well, because we handle the Oracle Database much better than Amazon does. We can run very large Oracle databases. We've run it both tolerantly. We just do a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the -- they run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliably and more securely. Well, if I've got the database -- if I have [ph] got the database in an Oracle data center and in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application on the computer right next to that. That's higher performance, much lower cost because I'm not moving all this data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. You -- those things are going to be co-located. So we think we have some built-in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS and making it very -- for all the customers who want to get their Infrastructure as a Service. So they're related. They're related Infrastructure as a Service from the same cloud supplier and in the same data center."

I mean, first starts with we booked more than we planned, sort of point 1. And we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought. So it improved our linearity as we went. Our team has done a great job in cloud ops from a provisioning perspective, provisioning meaning we then sell more, we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and wide. And that has another effect on revenue linearity. In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year. And that's -- it was better than we expected but it was good. It was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we've had this continued sort of not linear but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription but on [indiscernible] just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things -- and no one thing was 80% of it, Kash. It was really all of those things together added up to the beat that you referenced. Your second question was the relative growth rates of the various businesses. I'd start with they're sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it. The question becomes degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on ERP in terms of growth rate. And that number, I think I gave it to you quarter-on-quarter in terms of growth rate. And you know what I'll do, as we get towards Financial Analyst Day, I'll do more of a breakout pillar by pillar. But they're just all strong. I mean, our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM and the HCM -- I can't help myself here. On HCM, the performance of our team on HCM was just superb. And I mean, that's a global statement, Kash. I mean, if we went back to the days of 4, 5 years ago, it's just amazing. Totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we've gotten. I mean, we get almost 1,000 new HCM customers this year. 2.5x the guide we were talking about 3 or 4 years ago. I mean, it's just -- it's so -- it's just -- it was just a superb quarter for us by pillar.

I think it's made version 12 of our database one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years. The question is what will that adoption look like? I think you'll see early adoption in the cloud. I think cloud's going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customers. A typical customer might have said, ""Okay, I'd like to start experimenting with Release 12, and then I'm going to put it on these 5 development computers over here."" Well, we're encouraging our customers to look at an alternative. Why don't you just use the latest version in the cloud? And why don't you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration to -- and your upgrade in the cloud? It's going to save you some money and allow you to get access even faster. And we think that's what's going to happen. We're also offering versions of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations that if it's -- because of -- for statutory reasons on a bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into the cloud. No problem. We'll take our existing cloud -- our cloud hardware, the exact same configuration, we will move it behind your firewall, and we'll let you run -- and we'll completely manage it for you behind your firewall. You'll buy it just like this cloud. In other words, you won't buy the hardware. There will be no upfront cost for the hardware. There's no upfront cost for the software. It will look exactly like the Oracle cloud. It's just a box that will happen to be sitting on your data center for -- behind your firewall. So we're giving people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud because when our customers go to the cloud, which is what we want them to do, and we want them to go earlier and we -- and other option is to get them to move to the cloud with accelerated adoption of 12.2 of our database. That's how we like them to consume it. If they go to the cloud, they save money and it's easier for them. And we make more money and it's better for us. So that will be -- we'll be pushing our people. So again, we're incented and the customer's incented to get to the cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4 and we're going to keep pushing this fiscal year."

But best of my knowledge, we don't have a deal to do that with JPMorgan Chase. But anyway, let's say they are uncomfortable -- again, they've got certain statutes.

So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now we've actually cleaned up a few things. So I made some changes 3 or 4 years ago to which we've called on what and there were some things that we've done that are -- I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes. But who calls on what size of accounts, et cetera. So there's a little bit of that but frankly not much else. We have made an investment, Phil, as I know you know, in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplements it. And we continue to raise the bar for those teams. It is a lower cost of sale. It is a much modern -- more modern way of selling, and it is our primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB. And we continue to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools. We talked last -- I think last quarter about an investment we made in Austin in the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that, Phil, more people, more support for that team. And they're actually calling higher in terms of the size of accounts that they're calling. Very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, our spending actually doesn't go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments. In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That's just pure nonsense. If anything, we believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money. You sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry. And that's our model and that's what we've done. In terms of on-prem comp, in just applications, these are applications that are not our GBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some ""comp"" in the context as it relates to a license sale. But Phil, to understand today, in horizontal apps licenses, the majority -- the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP into an existing base, more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there's some noise about it, but I would describe this as a nonevent. By the way, I want to add -- I want to add because I just can't help myself. But as of today, we have all of our salespeople have a territory. They have a comp plan. They have a boss. And virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year, have today been trained on all of our newest offering. So I've had this goal. Larry and I talked about this for years, that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever -- by the way, most companies take a quarter, 4 months, 5 months to get all this done. Our objective has been that salespeople leave the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they've been trained on everything we've got.

Now that's come from where we've been over the past couple of years, but I don't know that I would describe that as a market phenomenon. I'm just going to make my comments in the context of Oracle. I think our team in Asia, which we've recruited over the past 18 months, did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line. I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb. So very positive on Asia. I feel the same way in Europe. I mean, there's a mixed economy over in Europe. We don't actually talk about it much around here because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4. So I feel very good about it. I think that's the way I would describe things outside the U.S. LAD, we continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD relative to the market, I think our team performed fantastic. Our movement to the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we have across our company. So -- and then you get to the U.S. and I think in applications, our moved to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and it shows up in the maturity of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. I mean, there's some just very exciting movements. Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business. It is not a license business. It is a cloud business. North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings, platform bookings. And I would say I'd also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in our GBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win in Pfizer in the quarter, and they have really kicked their competitor in metadata pretty strong over the course of the year. And I'd like to publicly give them the credit for that. They've done a great job. So maybe more data than you wanted, but that's my view going across the globe."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.Clear",1574,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are thrilled with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically overachieved again in the cloud. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS, PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year '15 and now 52% in fiscal year '16. And not to get ahead of myself but we expect to see even higher SaaS, PaaS growth this year. We'll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected, with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high end of my guidance and up 17% sequentially. Now as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is 100% accurate, and if anything, slightly conservative.
You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we are now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way: revenue growth, deferred revenue growth and billings growth. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4, and we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion, with software updates and product support revenue at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud.
Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was USD 0.66. Had currencies not moved, by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.
Now covering the full fiscal year. Total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 52%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-premise software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion as continued growth in software support offset cloud-related declines in new software license. So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS, PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year '17 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an on-premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business. And then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year.
For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion and operating income was $15.8 billion. And assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS were $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customers' strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the Accelerated Buying Experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own Configure, Price, Quote product sales and service cloud.
We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use click-to-accept functionality for enterprise customers. And that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly 2/3 of our cloud deals were processed using the Accelerated Buying Experience, and we saw quote-to-book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing given we introduced the program in Q4 and sales people had very little time to get used to it.
Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with thousands of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their businesses. We are far enough along that our financial statement will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned with in the cloud.
Now to my guidance. I'm going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year '17. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now if currency -- if current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenue but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformation, I'm definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad, and I'm going to be a bit conservative in my outlook.
Even with that said, for Q1, I'm raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support, is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter -- last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues, and of course, the tax rate.
Over the full year for FY '17, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 52% in FY '16. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY '17 much higher than the 57% reported today as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier -- as I mentioned earlier, but operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency.
And with that, I will turn it over to Larry."

In the fiscal year just started, FY '17, Oracle has 2 specific points of focus: first, we'd like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we're at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue.
We're the second-largest SaaS company in the world now, and we think we can be the largest SaaS company. Pretty -- by the time we get to $10 billion, we think we're going to be the first one there. Why do I think that's possible? One is we're already growing at a very high rate, much faster than our competitors. We've proven we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale? Safra pointed out something that's kind of shocking, but as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is. We're a major player in ERP and HCM. We're almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We're the #1 player in marketing. We're very competitive. We're #1 in type. We're #1 in service. And we compete against Salesforce.com in sales automation.
But in all of these areas we compete, Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company, is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions. They're growing their business, but they're in the customer experience sales area. They don't compete in the largest category, which is ERP. Also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing again. And we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider.
And some of these mid-market companies can simply get an all-Oracle footprint, run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That's -- it's something that Salesforce can't offer, and we think that's going to serve us very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rates while we go for that, to be first to $10 billion.
Okay. That's one thing. So we want to be #1. We think we need to be #1. We think we will be #1 in SaaS and PaaS.
Second major point of focus is that our generation 2 of our Infrastructure as a Service data center has been built and stocked with computers. And now we're beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers. Infrastructure as a Service is the third leg of Oracle's cloud strategy. Obviously, SaaS, we talk about a lot, and PaaS, we talk a lot about because those 2 businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle.
So what's going on in Infrastructure as a Service? Well, we've had to move to -- we've learned a lot about this business. There's a huge amount of demand, by the way, for our Infrastructure as a Service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers, but even bigger amount of demand for Infrastructure as a Service from our database customers. Our database customers want to move their applications into our cloud, putting their database onto our Platform as a Service and then their applications, so a lot of custom applications, onto our Infrastructure as a Service. These 2 things go together.
And we've built, again, the second-generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there. Lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors. And there's huge demand for it, and we're now starting to bring customers into that.
We think that's another very important driver to Oracle's overall growth. We're growing fast in SaaS. We're growing fast in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in Infrastructure as a Service. We've made the investments. We have the right technology with our second-generation data centers. And we're very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud.
I'll turn it over to Mark."

Cloud bookings, over USD 600 million, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year, we grew more than 200%. So this comparison is -- or this number is against that comparison. In SaaS, roughly USD 350 million bookings. In PaaS, over $250 million.
Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So we've had some questions about, do we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings, kept separate and are right around 40 [ph]. As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year.
SaaS, PaaS revenue, we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in 3 years. That says our business has gotten bigger.
In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double digits. In Data as a Service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a Service had another breakout quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. Within doubling quarter-on-quarter, our Database as a Service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter. 
Our SaaS, PaaS billings grew 48% in FY '16. Our SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra's point, and I want to say it again, grew much faster than Salesforce.com and Workday.
Now I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we've closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly 2/3 were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions. That is an all-time high for us. 273 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connection point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on. Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers.
In the quarter, we had almost 700 CX customers and 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5x that what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure I didn't misspeak. It's 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY '16 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle app. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5x the installed base from last year. We have 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly 1,000 go-lives this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers.
In closing, this was a big year for us not only in revenue but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR.
I'm going to make just a couple predictions for the new year. We had a big year in bookings in FY '16. We will have a bigger year in FY '17. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings and our revenue reported growth rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY '17. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster.
So with that, we'll take whatever questions that you might have."

We get really all of the servers. That's why we get this multiple support that when we get an application, the whole stack comes with us. The same thing in effect occurs when we get Database as a Service as well. With it comes all of the other services that come with it as well. In addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten to. We get now to a whole set of mid-market customers that frankly, we just didn't have an opportunity to sell to before because you have to have a data center, you have to have a computer and you had to have a staff.

So if you have, let's say, your ERP application and it's an Oracle ERP application, then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system. In a sense, you feel it's perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle, and then I'll put the data warehousing situation at Microsoft Azure. But if you actually look at the pricing -- cloud pricing, the one part of cloud that's expensive is moving data out of data centers. That's one thing they charge you a lot of money for. And then that's the kind of industry pricing, the way it works. So moving data between data centers, back and forth, back and forth between data centers, can be quite expensive. So there is an advantage for our built-in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built-in advantage by offering our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data markets [ph] using that ERP data. So I think that gives us a very significant advantage, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. I'll go back to Infrastructure as a Service. Well, why should they -- why should anyone -- why should I just move to Amazon? I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they got Infrastructure as a Service. Well, because we handle the Oracle Database much better than Amazon does. We can run very large Oracle databases. We've run it both tolerantly. We just do a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the Oracle. They run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliably, more securely. Well, if I've got the database -- if I handle -- got the database in an Oracle data center and in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application on the computer right next to that. That's higher performance, much lower cost because I'm not moving all this data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. You -- those things are going to be -- tend to be co-located. So we think we have some built-in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS and making it very -- a lot of customers who'll want to get their Infrastructure as a Service. So they're related. They're related Infrastructure as a Service from the same cloud supplier and in the same data center."

I mean, first starts with we booked more than we planned, sort of point 1. And we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought. So it improved our linearity as we went. Our team has done a great job in cloud ops from a provisioning perspective, provisioning meaning we then sell more, we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and wide. And that has another effect on revenue linearity. In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year. Not say it was better than we expected, but it was good, it was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we've had this continued sort of not linear but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription but on [indiscernible] just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things -- and no one thing was 80% of it, Kash. It was really all of those things together that added up to the beat that you referenced. Your second question was the relative growth rates of the various businesses. I'd start with, they're sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it. And the question becomes degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on ERP in terms of growth rate. And that number, I think I gave it to you quarter-on-quarter in terms of growth rate. And you know what I'll do, as we get towards Financial Analyst Day, I'll do more of a breakout pillar by pillar. But they're just all strong. I mean, our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM and the HCM -- I can't help myself here. On HCM, the performance of our team on HCM was just superb. And I mean, that's a global statement, Kash. I mean, if we went back to the days of 4, 5 years ago, it's just amazing. Totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we've gotten. I mean, we did almost 1,000 new HCM customers this year. 2.5x the guide we were talking about 3 or 4 years ago. I mean, it's just -- it's so -- it's just -- it was just a superb quarter for us by pillar. And I think to be honest with you, Kash, I think based on what I told you in my prepared remarks on the pipeline, I think it's going to get better."

I think it's made version 12 of our database one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years. The question is what will that adoption look like? I think you'll see early adoption in the cloud. I think cloud's going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customers. A typical customer might have said, ""Okay, I'd like to start experimenting with Release 12, and then I'm going to put it on these 5 development computers over here."" Well, we're encouraging our customers to look at an alternative. Why don't you just use the latest version in the cloud? And why don't you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration to -- and your upgrade in the cloud? It's going to save you some money and allow you to get access even faster. And we think that's what's going to happen. We're also offering versions of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations, that if -- you say, well, because of -- for statutory reasons on a bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into the cloud. No problem. We'll take our existing cloud -- our cloud hardware, the exact same configuration, we will move it behind your firewall, and we'll let you run -- and we'll completely manage it for you behind your firewall. You'll buy it just like it's cloud. In other words, you won't buy the hardware. There will be no upfront cost for the hardware. There's no upfront cost for the software. It will look exactly like the Oracle cloud. It's just a box that will happen to be sitting on your data center floor behind your firewall. So we're giving people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud because when our customers go to the cloud, which is what we want them to do, and we want them to go earlier and we -- another option to get them to move to the cloud is with accelerated adoption of 12.2 of our database. That's how we'd like them to consume it. If they go to the cloud, they save money and it's easier for them. And we make more money and it's better for us. So that will be -- we'll be pushing our people. So again, we're incented and the customer's incented to get to the cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4 and we're going to keep pushing this fiscal year."

When we install it as part of the cloud and we manage it for you. But we have a separate box where you're running compute and block storage and all of our other cloud services. We basically -- it's like we'd open another cloud data center. Imagine we open another cloud data center at JPMorgan Chase. I'm not picking on my poor friend, Jamie Dimon. But best of my knowledge, we don't have a deal to do that with JPMorgan Chase. But anyway, let's say they are uncomfortable -- again, they've got certain statutes. Regulators want them to do this behind their firewall. They're uncomfortable when put in a public cloud. We would actually create a little mini version of our cloud data center on the JPMorgan Chase floor. We would manage it for them. They would not buy the hardware. They would not buy the software. They would just buy a cloud subscription just like it's in our cloud. It just so happens we would locate that hardware, which we would match.

So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now we've actually cleaned up a few things. So I made some changes 3 or 4 years ago to which we've called on what and there were some things that we've done that are -- I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes. But who calls on what size of accounts, et cetera. So there's a little bit of that, but frankly not much else. We have made an investment, Phil, as I know you know, in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplements it. And we continue to raise the bar for those teams. It is a lower cost of sale. It is a much modern -- more modern way of selling, and it is our primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB. And we continue to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools. We talked last -- I think last quarter about an investment we made in Austin, the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that, Phil, more people, more support for that team. And they're actually calling higher in terms of the size of accounts that they call and very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, our spending actually doesn't go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments. In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That's just pure nonsense. If anything, we believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money, you sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry. And that's our model and that's what we've done. In terms of on-prem comp, in just applications, these are applications that are not our GBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some ""comp"" in the context as it relates to a license sale. But Phil, to understand today, in horizontal apps licenses, the majority -- the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP into an existing base, more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there's some noise about it, but I would describe this as a nonevent. By the way, I want to add -- I want to add because I just can't help myself. But as of today, we have all of our salespeople have a territory. They have a comp plan. They have a boss. And virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year, have today been trained on all of our newest offerings. So I've had this goal. Larry and I talked about this for years, that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever -- by the way, most companies take a quarter, 4 months, 5 months to get all this done. Our objective has been that salespeople leave the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they've been trained on everything we've got. And I can tell you, as we sit here today, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle Corporation."

I think our team in Asia, which we've recruited over the past 18 months, did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line. I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb. So very positive on Asia. I feel the same way in Europe. I mean, there's a mixed economy over in Europe we don't actually talk about much around here because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years.

Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business. It is not a license business. It is a cloud business. North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings, platform bookings. And I would say I'd also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in our GBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win in Pfizer in the quarter, and they have really kicked their competitor, Medidata, pretty strong over the course of the year. And I'd like to publicly give them the credit for that. They've done a great job. So maybe more data than you wanted, but that's my view going across the globe."

But when I look at our pipelines, I remember 2 years ago, I made the statement that I thought our ARR would be good a couple of years ago and a lot of people said why. And it's because our pipeline was up and I can see it mature through the pipeline. This pipeline we have now is the strongest, best pipeline we've had. And I believe our conversion rate, meaning the movement of that pipeline into actually booked orders will actually get better for the very reasons we're describing.

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.Clear",1574,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY '17, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are thrilled with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically overachieved again in the cloud. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS, PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year '15 and now 52% in fiscal year '16. And not to get ahead of myself but we expect to see even higher SaaS, PaaS growth this year. We'll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected, with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high end of my guidance and up 17% sequentially. Now as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is 100% accurate, and if anything, slightly conservative.
You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we are now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way: revenue growth, deferred revenue growth and billings growth. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4, and we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion, with software updates and product support revenue at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud.
Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was USD 0.66. Had currencies not moved, by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.
Now covering the full fiscal year. Total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 52%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-premise software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion as continued growth in software support offset cloud-related declines in new software license. So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS, PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year '17 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an on-premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business. And then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year.
For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion and operating income was $15.8 billion. And assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS were $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customers' strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the Accelerated Buying Experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own Configure, Price, Quote product sales and service cloud.
We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use click-to-accept functionality for enterprise customers. And that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly 2/3 of our cloud deals were processed using the Accelerated Buying Experience, and we saw quote-to-book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing given we introduced the program in Q4 and sales people had very little time to get used to it.
Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with thousands of our customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their businesses. We are far enough along that our financial statement will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time, leading to very solid EPS growth. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned with in the cloud.
Now to my guidance. I'm going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year '17. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now if currency -- if current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenue but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformation, I'm definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad, and I'm going to be a bit conservative in my outlook.
Even with that said, for Q1, I'm raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support, is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter -- last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues, and of course, the tax rate.
Over the full year for FY '17, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 52% in FY '16. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY '17 much higher than the 57% reported today as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier -- as I mentioned earlier, but operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency.
And with that, I will turn it over to Larry."

In the fiscal year just started, FY '17, Oracle has 2 specific points of focus: first, we'd like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we're at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue.
We're the second-largest SaaS company in the world now, and we think we can be the largest SaaS company. Pretty -- by the time we get to $10 billion, we think we're going to be the first one there. Why do I think that's possible? One is we're already growing at a very high rate, much faster than our competitors. We've proven we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale? Safra pointed out something that's kind of shocking, but as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is. We're a major player in ERP and HCM. We're almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We're the #1 player in marketing. We're very competitive. We're #1 in type. We're #1 in service. And we compete against Salesforce.com in sales automation.
But in all of these areas we compete, Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company, is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions. They're growing their business, but they're in the customer experience sales area. They don't compete in the largest category, which is ERP. Also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing again. And we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider.
And some of these mid-market companies can simply get an all-Oracle footprint, run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That's -- it's something that Salesforce can't offer, and we think that's going to serve us very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rates while we go for that, to be first to $10 billion.
Okay. That's one thing. So we want to be #1. We think we need to be #1. We think we will be #1 in SaaS and PaaS.
Second major point of focus is that our generation 2 of our Infrastructure as a Service data center has been built and stocked with computers. And now we're beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers. Infrastructure as a Service is the third leg of Oracle's cloud strategy. Obviously, SaaS, we talk about a lot, and PaaS, we talk a lot about because those 2 businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle.
So what's going on in Infrastructure as a Service? Well, we've had to move to -- we've learned a lot about this business. There's a huge amount of demand, by the way, for our Infrastructure as a Service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers, but even bigger amount of demand for Infrastructure as a Service from our database customers. Our database customers want to move their applications into our cloud, putting their database onto our Platform as a Service and then their applications, so a lot of custom applications, onto our Infrastructure as a Service. These 2 things go together.
And we've built, again, the second-generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there. Lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors. And there's huge demand for it, and we're now starting to bring customers into that.
We think that's another very important driver to Oracle's overall growth. We're growing fast in SaaS. We're growing fast in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in Infrastructure as a Service. We've made the investments. We have the right technology with our second-generation data centers. And we're very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud.
I'll turn it over to Mark."

Cloud bookings, over USD 600 million, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year, we grew more than 200%. So this comparison is -- or this number is against that comparison. In SaaS, roughly USD 350 million bookings. In PaaS, over $250 million.
Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So we've had some questions about, do we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings, kept separate and are right around 40 [ph]. As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year.
SaaS, PaaS revenue, we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in 3 years. That says our business has gotten bigger.
In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double digits. In Data as a Service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a Service had another breakout quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. Within doubling quarter-on-quarter, our Database as a Service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter. 
Our SaaS, PaaS billings grew 48% in FY '16. Our SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra's point, and I want to say it again, grew much faster than Salesforce.com and Workday.
Now I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we've closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly 2/3 were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions. That is an all-time high for us. 273 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connection point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on. Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers.
In the quarter, we had almost 700 CX customers and 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5x that what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure I didn't misspeak. It's 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY '16 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle app. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5x the installed base from last year. We have 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly 1,000 go-lives this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers.
In closing, this was a big year for us not only in revenue but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR.
I'm going to make just a couple predictions for the new year. We had a big year in bookings in FY '16. We will have a bigger year in FY '17. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings and our revenue reported growth rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY '17. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster.
So with that, we'll take whatever questions that you might have."

So if you have, let's say, your ERP application and it's an Oracle ERP application, then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system. In a sense, you feel it's perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle, and then I'll put the data warehousing situation at Microsoft Azure. But if you actually look at the pricing -- cloud pricing, the one part of cloud that's expensive is moving data out of data centers. That's one thing they charge you a lot of money for. And then that's the kind of industry pricing, the way it works. So moving data between data centers, back and forth, back and forth between data centers, can be quite expensive. So there is an advantage for our built-in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built-in advantage by offering our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data markets [ph] using that ERP data. So I think that gives us a very significant advantage, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. I'll go back to Infrastructure as a Service. Well, why should they -- why should anyone -- why should I just move to Amazon? I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they got Infrastructure as a Service. Well, because we handle the Oracle Database much better than Amazon does. We can run very large Oracle databases. We've run it both tolerantly. We just do a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the Oracle. They run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliably, more securely. Well, if I've got the database -- if I handle -- got the database in an Oracle data center and in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application on the computer right next to that. That's higher performance, much lower cost because I'm not moving all this data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. You -- those things are going to be -- tend to be co-located. So we think we have some built-in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS and making it very -- a lot of customers who'll want to get their Infrastructure as a Service. So they're related. They're related Infrastructure as a Service from the same cloud supplier and in the same data center."

I mean, first starts with we booked more than we planned, sort of point 1. And we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought. So it improved our linearity as we went. Our team has done a great job in cloud ops from a provisioning perspective, provisioning meaning we then sell more, we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and wide. And that has another effect on revenue linearity. In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year. Not say it was better than we expected, but it was good, it was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we've had this continued sort of not linear but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription but on [indiscernible] just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things -- and no one thing was 80% of it, Kash. It was really all of those things together that added up to the beat that you referenced. Your second question was the relative growth rates of the various businesses. I'd start with, they're sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it. And the question becomes degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on ERP in terms of growth rate. And that number, I think I gave it to you quarter-on-quarter in terms of growth rate. And you know what I'll do, as we get towards Financial Analyst Day, I'll do more of a breakout pillar by pillar. But they're just all strong. I mean, our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM and the HCM -- I can't help myself here. On HCM, the performance of our team on HCM was just superb. And I mean, that's a global statement, Kash. I mean, if we went back to the days of 4, 5 years ago, it's just amazing. Totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we've gotten. I mean, we did almost 1,000 new HCM customers this year. 2.5x the guide we were talking about 3 or 4 years ago. I mean, it's just -- it's so -- it's just -- it was just a superb quarter for us by pillar. And I think to be honest with you, Kash, I think based on what I told you in my prepared remarks on the pipeline, I think it's going to get better."

I think it's made version 12 of our database one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years. The question is what will that adoption look like? I think you'll see early adoption in the cloud. I think cloud's going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customers. A typical customer might have said, ""Okay, I'd like to start experimenting with Release 12, and then I'm going to put it on these 5 development computers over here."" Well, we're encouraging our customers to look at an alternative. Why don't you just use the latest version in the cloud? And why don't you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration to -- and your upgrade in the cloud? It's going to save you some money and allow you to get access even faster. And we think that's what's going to happen. We're also offering versions of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations, that if -- you say, well, because of -- for statutory reasons on a bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into the cloud. No problem. We'll take our existing cloud -- our cloud hardware, the exact same configuration, we will move it behind your firewall, and we'll let you run -- and we'll completely manage it for you behind your firewall. You'll buy it just like it's cloud. In other words, you won't buy the hardware. There will be no upfront cost for the hardware. There's no upfront cost for the software. It will look exactly like the Oracle cloud. It's just a box that will happen to be sitting on your data center floor behind your firewall. So we're giving people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud because when our customers go to the cloud, which is what we want them to do, and we want them to go earlier and we -- another option to get them to move to the cloud is with accelerated adoption of 12.2 of our database. That's how we'd like them to consume it. If they go to the cloud, they save money and it's easier for them. And we make more money and it's better for us. So that will be -- we'll be pushing our people. So again, we're incented and the customer's incented to get to the cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4 and we're going to keep pushing this fiscal year."

When we install it as part of the cloud and we manage it for you. But we have a separate box where you're running compute and block storage and all of our other cloud services. We basically -- it's like we'd open another cloud data center. Imagine we open another cloud data center at JPMorgan Chase. I'm not picking on my poor friend, Jamie Dimon. But best of my knowledge, we don't have a deal to do that with JPMorgan Chase. But anyway, let's say they are uncomfortable -- again, they've got certain statutes. Regulators want them to do this behind their firewall. They're uncomfortable when put in a public cloud. We would actually create a little mini version of our cloud data center on the JPMorgan Chase floor. We would manage it for them. They would not buy the hardware. They would not buy the software. They would just buy a cloud subscription just like it's in our cloud. It just so happens we would locate that hardware, which we would match.

So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now we've actually cleaned up a few things. So I made some changes 3 or 4 years ago to which we've called on what and there were some things that we've done that are -- I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes. But who calls on what size of accounts, et cetera. So there's a little bit of that, but frankly not much else. We have made an investment, Phil, as I know you know, in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplements it. And we continue to raise the bar for those teams. It is a lower cost of sale. It is a much modern -- more modern way of selling, and it is our primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB. And we continue to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools. We talked last -- I think last quarter about an investment we made in Austin, the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that, Phil, more people, more support for that team. And they're actually calling higher in terms of the size of accounts that they call and very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, our spending actually doesn't go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments. In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That's just pure nonsense. If anything, we believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money, you sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry. And that's our model and that's what we've done. In terms of on-prem comp, in just applications, these are applications that are not our GBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some ""comp"" in the context as it relates to a license sale. But Phil, to understand today, in horizontal apps licenses, the majority -- the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP into an existing base, more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there's some noise about it, but I would describe this as a nonevent. By the way, I want to add -- I want to add because I just can't help myself. But as of today, we have all of our salespeople have a territory. They have a comp plan. They have a boss. And virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year, have today been trained on all of our newest offerings. So I've had this goal. Larry and I talked about this for years, that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever -- by the way, most companies take a quarter, 4 months, 5 months to get all this done. Our objective has been that salespeople leave the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they've been trained on everything we've got. And I can tell you, as we sit here today, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle Corporation."

I think our team in Asia, which we've recruited over the past 18 months, did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line. I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb. So very positive on Asia. I feel the same way in Europe. I mean, there's a mixed economy over in Europe we don't actually talk about much around here because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4. So I feel very good about it. I think that's the way I would describe things outside the U.S. LAD, we continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD relative to the market, I think our team performed fantastic. Our movement to the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we have across our company. So -- and then you get to the U.S. and I think in applications, our move to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and it shows up in the maturity of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. I mean, there's some just very exciting movements. Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business. It is not a license business. It is a cloud business. North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings, platform bookings. And I would say I'd also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in our GBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win in Pfizer in the quarter, and they have really kicked their competitor, Medidata, pretty strong over the course of the year. And I'd like to publicly give them the credit for that. They've done a great job. So maybe more data than you wanted, but that's my view going across the globe."

Now let me say all this against the backdrop of I think we're actually going to get better at this. So I think when you look at our -- you can't look at them. I can't. But when I look at our pipelines, I remember 2 years ago, I made the statement that I thought our ARR would be good a couple of years ago and a lot of people said why. And it's because our pipeline was up and I can see it mature through the pipeline. This pipeline we have now is the strongest, best pipeline we've had. And I believe our conversion rate, meaning the movement of that pipeline into actually booked orders will actually get better for the very reasons we're describing. And so I'm quite optimistic about it."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1, I'll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. 
Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we overachieved again in the cloud, especially in The United States. As you all know, we have pivoted the organization to go after the cloud and we are outperforming even our most aggressive expectations. This has resulted in our growth rate continuing to accelerate, as we scale in the cloud. Something our competitors are not similarly experiencing.
We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.  This quarter, the effects of currency movements were more than expected, mostly, because of surprised Brexit vote happened after our earnings call, resulting in a 1% to 3% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and EPS, which was a penny lower as a result.
Cloud, SaaS and PaaS revenues for the quarter with $815 million, up 82% from last year and above the 80% high end of my guidance. While this excellent growth rates was helped a little by recent acquisitions, organic growth accelerated from both Q4 and Q1 of last year, actually organic, SaaS and PaaS growth rate has accelerated for 7 straight quarters. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The growth's deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.5 billion, up 49%'s in US dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 49% in US dollars this quarter, up from 38% last quarter.  We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. 
Our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to a point, where the dollar growth in SaaS and PaaS revenue exceeded the dollar declines in new software license. Together, SaaS and PaaS subscription and new software license grew 16% in constant currency. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross -- the growth margin also continues to expand. The Q1 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 62%, up from 40% last Q1. And we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time. 
Combined with cloud infrastructure as a service, revenue of $171 million, which was up 10%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up 63% in constant currency from last year. 
Total on-premise software revenues were $5.8 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year.
Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high-level, as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. 
New software license revenues were slightly over $1 billion, down 10%, reflecting the continued migration to cloud. Total hardware including hardware support was down 11%, with hardware systems product revenue of $462 million and hardware support revenue of $535 million.
Our engineered systems grew mid-double-digit lead by Exadata that grew over 30% in the quarter. 
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.6 million, up 3% from last year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.4 billion and operating margin was 39%. 
I need to remind you that the large debt offering that we did last quarter, costs about half a penny in EPS this quarter. The additional interest was not in my guidance, as the debt offering took place after the guidance call. For Q2, I expect the added interest will lower EPS by more than a penny, without the matching benefit of net suites contribution to earnings, which will be accretive until the deal closes. 
G&A expenses were also higher than usual in Q1, because of some legal fees, which will be lower in the second quarter and largely gone by Q3, as a result of the settlement of 1 case and the end of 2 trials.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was higher than projected due to the geographic mix of earnings, which is driven by our overachievement in cloud revenues in the U.S., resulting in a tax rate of 25.5%, and EPS being $0.01 lower at $0.55 in US dollars, but still up 5% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 22.8% and GAAP EPS was $0.43 in in USD, up 11% in constant currency. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.7 billion, capital expenditures for the quarter were $299 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 5% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.5 billion, up 5% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisition, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial strength. This quarter we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. And the Board of Directors, again, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. For those of you curious about NetSuite, I can report that we have now cleared antitrust reviews everywhere, except The United States, where our waiting period expires at the end of September.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then some updated comments for the fiscal year. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. And while we feel good about our own performance and transformation, I'm always keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially brought. 
If current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow, again, 78% to 82%, a little bit more than I guided last time. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS and PaaS and IAS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 3%. EPS is expected to be between $0.59 and $0.62 in constant currency. We're not for the higher tax rate and interest expense, we would expect EPS to grow approximately 4% or be $0.06 higher. Over the full year of fiscal year '17, I'm raising the outlook for fiscal year '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 65% to 67%.
I continue to expect the SaaS and PaaS gross margin will exit Q4 higher than the 62% reported today, as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark, for his comments."

I'm going to give you a lot of numbers. Let me start with bookings and revenue growth rates. I'm going to give them to you year-on-year and CD, unless I state otherwise. 
Cloud bookings ARR was $271 million in USD of 42% growth. As a reminder, ARR growth last year was 166%. SaaS bookings were $165 million USD and PaaS, IAS bookings were $106 million USD. As Safra said, SaaS PaaS revenue was up 82%, I just want to repeat the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth acceleration. 
Our ERP, EPM revenue grew 70% quarter-on-quarter. The seventh consecutive quarter with sequential growth that was greater than 50%. Infusion HCM, we grew 131%. Nearly 4x the growth rate of Workday.
And CX separately up double-digit in sales marketing, and service. Data as a Service was up 75%. Platform as a Service up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Overall, we grew 82%. The highest global growth rate at any scale cloud company. 
SaaS, PaaS billings grew 49% in the quarter, up from 38% last quarter. Deferred SaaS, PaaS revenue was up 49%. 
SaaS customer metrics. We closed 776 new SaaS customers in the quarter. We have 677 expansions. 125 customers, who bought SaaS also about PaaS. 346 new CX customers, 488 expansions. A 173 new HCM customers drove that great result, inclusive of 69 expansions. 344 ERP EPM customers and 135 expansions. Our active base is now 2,800 customers with a 1,000 live 10 export day. Over 50% of our ERP EPM customers were net new to Oracle, that never purchased an Oracle app before.
2/3 of our new customer wins were fusion, the 34 goal eyes in fusion, our best quarter over. 2,032 PaaS customers that were new in the quarter. Our installed base is now 11,000 PaaS customers. 1,671 new infrastructures or service customers that are supplemental to our PaaS customers. Together, our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure is now at 18,892 customers. As a point of clarification, PaaS an infrastructure customers accounted for each service that they use. 
In closing, this was just a very solid quarter for us.  Not only in revenue, but bookings and billings. 
Look forward to few predictions. Q1 bookings were solid at 42%. I believe Q2 will be better, could even be much better. Q1 revenue was fantastic at 82%. It's one of the reasons, as Safra described, we're raising our guidance from 65% to 67%. And I just want to close by saying, we are the fastest growing scaled cloud company in the world. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

We're very excited about the rollout of our generation 2 Infrastructure as a service data centers.

Plus, our new metal offering makes it possible for our customers to lift and shift their entire existing corporate infrastructure, data and applications without any changes whatsoever and move it to the Oracle Public Cloud. You just can't do that with Amazon Web Services.
Lift and shift the entire network, DM, database, data, applications, move all of that across to our data centers without changing anything. So real advantage. So for first time, we have this big technology advantage in the Infrastructure as a Service. We expect this will enable Oracle to accelerate our Infrastructure as a Service business to the same high growth rates that we're currently experiencing in both SaaS and PaaS. 
With that, we're ready for questions."

Our customers are more aware. We have more references. We have more go lives and all of that deep together. In addition, we not only have more products, we're going to release more products, yet, even this week at -- or next week at Open World. But more of our existing products are available in more geographies. So as for example, as we released ERP. ERP, actually has not been available in every geographic market in the world as it now is.

From a perspective, it looks like over the past few years, we've seen Oracle make a large push away from potential licenses towards attrition-based SaaS offerings on the application side of business. And now, it appears that, that push is shifting more to database tech side of the business. Stearing more business towards Platform as a Service.

So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were ready, we moved aggressively to sell those applications. We believe that's what customer wanted. They wanted cloud-based applications, not on-premise-based application. We have made a huge investment rewriting all of our applications. And those were ready before -- and we were ready to move into SaaS application. Before we were ready to move into Infrastructure as a Service our PaaS, we're just ready sooner. So we pushed back. The interest, again -- the interesting thing here is, we are just beginning to move our database customers from on-premise into the cloud.
Microsoft has already done a very good job of moving their Office customers from on-prem into the cloud and that's the basis of the overwhelming basis of their cloud growth. The overwhelming basis of our cloud growth are new customers for applications. So we haven't start shifting our base yet, which I think is very interesting. We got these applications ready. We're gaining shares, let's say, we mention Workday a lot, because they are a primary competitor for HCM and ERP in the cloud. And as Mark pointed out, we have 10x more -- as we got 10x more customers than Workday in ERP. And we sold more. But those are more are net new customers, okay. So the that's gaining share in that business. We're now beginning to move our installed base into the cloud. And this is a lot expansion. It's not like your stock running on-premise, we believe next decade. This is a coexistent story. They are going to continue running some of their stuff on-premise and they're going to move some of their stuff into the cloud and those 2 things have to coexist. And our unique offerings to our customers and our database is the fact that we support the identical software on-premise and in the cloud. And you can move data and work load back and forth very, very gracefully. That's our PaaS offering. And by the way, if you are a SaaS customer, your applications built on top of our database and our middleware. So you buy SaaS with PaaS. You often buy together, as Mark pointed out. Finally, until PaaS was ready second, we were moving aggressively in PaaS. Not what we're looking for is the third leg of the stool, which is to push into Infrastructure as a Service, where we have an all new  and very competitor Amazon.com, but we think now with our new generation data centers, we have few competitive advantage over Amazon.com. And people will be buying our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service together. So we sell PaaS twice. Sometimes we package PaaS with our application SaaS together. And this new business is selling PaaS with Infrastructure as a Service, where they're building a lot of custom applications or moving existing applications into the cloud. What I think about it is, our PaaS business is lot of new customers. We're just beginning to shift our installed base of some of the on-premise into the cloud, which is enormous potential for us.
And we think we make a lot of more money by moving customers off-premise into the cloud, because we do a lot more things for the customer. We help the customers save money, but we also provide with our database storage and networking and compute and all of associated support service. So we think, again, this is beginning of still more rapid growth for Oracle."

Our sales people become so much more productive, they can spend more of their time, really the bulk of their time with the customers outwardly facing, making them successful instead of inwardly facing, dealing with our own back office. So this has really unleashed a massive amount of productivity. Obviously, having many, many references is critical for the success of software service. Because customers, all talk to each other and the half year customers lead to more happy customers, which is by the way him one of the reasons, we love Oracle Open World. Because tens of thousands of our customers come and they share their positive experiences and that just gets more and more customers excited and participating.

The entire thing this very, very virtuous cycle, all of which starts with having the best product. That's really the bottom line, ultimately. As Larry mentioned, we spent a decade, frankly, it's a little over a decade in building these products. We had leading products to begin with, but we started and rewrote them all, focused exclusively -- really focused on the cloud and that's what ultimately shows through."

We just make a distinction between moving an existing application customer from, let's say, Oracle e-business customer to Oracle Fusion business in cloud.

Most of what you see in our cloud revenue number is customers that more than 50% were customers, who were not an Oracle application customer, before they became an Oracle SaaS customer. So these are really new customers. And then to your point, that are bringing new workloads that we had not before. The exciting part, which again, I'll go back to what Larry said was, the core of our on-prem user base, particularly, in the database arena has not moved. And that is a huge opportunity for us, that's only people that can move them into cloud efficiently and effectively our us. So that's why this is such an -- we get -- maybe we don't to as good job that we explain that we feel it here, because what we have seen so far is what you think of, John, is normally hardest stuff, going out and finding net new customers."

So that's very different than what you see going on in the Microsoft And our big installed base, which is the database, we're preeminent. We really haven't begun -- we're just beginning in the early stages of holding on to them and moving them on to the cloud. So it's bit of a different story between us and Microsoft. That exciting prospect of moving all those database customers to cloud, that's in front of us. 
And that's what makes and I, congratulate Microsoft on doing what they have done. It's the right strategy for them. Ours has been, what we have said, we want to do that, but we want to do more. And we think we have the opportunity.

While the bookings balance, it's just the current  period revenue that we got today. But this is overall a -- might be a very good story. And let's not lose the fact that other number that Safra described very early. Our margins are now at 62% in our SaaS, PaaS margins, which we talked about the way back when they were at 39%, as we were investing infrastructure to prepare for what we have now.

So first, you should take directions from what's going on in our gross profit lines for the most strategic part of our business, which is moving to the cloud and software and Software as a Service. And that is going to be very much followed up. One of the things we do have that is costing us is that our hardware business outside of our engineered system is getting smaller. And the expense line has not adjusted equally. As you can imagine, it pretty well that's something that's very straightforward for us to finish out during the year. And that is our expectation.
In addition, you also talked -- or you may have mentioned currency and tax and things like that. So obviously, currency is something I can't project. And I think after the Brexit vote, I'm sure nobody else projected it correctly either. But the way it affect us, just so that you know is that U.S. Oracle is ahead of Europe in a move to the cloud and in and outside of The United States. However, as Mark mentioned, the bookings are very, very high. So bookings that were booked in The United States over the past year are turning into revenue already in The United States. Since the number is smaller in Europe, the bookings, the revenue numbers of smaller, the bookings are approaching those of The United States. And those are going to start flowing through revenue. That will in fact, impact our tax rate and the adjusted back to the lower rate that you may be used to. So that's going to take a little while and that should go through. In addition, as you know, we do have some significant borrowings, and as a result, we have a very large amount of cash on our balance sheet right now, which is not earning very high result. We are looking forward to closing the next week deal, which we believe to be accretive. And that will also be helpful."

I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the mos",1163,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we overachieved again in the cloud, especially in the United States. As you all know, we have pivoted the organization to go after the cloud, and we are outperforming even our most aggressive expectations. This has resulted in our growth rate continuing to accelerate as we scale in the cloud, something our competitors are not similarly experiencing.
We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were more than expected, mostly because the surprise Brexit vote happened after our earnings call, resulting in a 1% to 3% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and EPS, which was $0.01 lower as a result.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $815 million, up 82% from last year and above the 80% high end of my guidance. While this excellent growth rate was helped a little by recent acquisitions, organic growth accelerated from both Q4 and Q1 of last year. Actually, organic, SaaS and PaaS growth rate has accelerated for 7 straight quarters. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our Cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.5 billion, up 49% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 49% in U.S. dollars this quarter, up from 38% last quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
Our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point where the dollar growth in SaaS and PaaS revenue exceeded the dollar declines in new software license. Together, SaaS and PaaS subscription and new software license grew 16% in constant currency. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin also continues to expand. The Q1 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 62%, up from 40% last Q1. And we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time.
Combined with Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, revenue of $171 million, which was up 10%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up 63% in constant currency from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $5.8 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high level as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1 billion, down 10%, reflecting the continued migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 11%, with hardware systems product revenue of $462 million and hardware support revenue of $535 million. Our Engineered Systems grew mid-double digits, led by Exadata that grew over 30% in the quarter.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.4 billion and operating margin was 39%.
I need to remind you that the large debt offering we did last quarter costs about $0.005 in EPS this quarter. The additional interest was not in my guidance as the debt offering took place after the guidance call. For Q2, I expect the add-in interest will lower EPS by more than $0.01, without the matching benefit of NetSuite's contribution to earnings, which will be accretive until the deal closes.
G&A expenses were also higher than usual in Q1 because of some legal fees, which will be lower in the second quarter and largely gone by Q3 as a result of the settlement of one case and the end of 2 trials.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was higher than projected due to the geographic mix of earnings, which is driven by our overachievement in cloud revenues in the U.S., resulting in a tax rate of 25.5%, and EPS being $0.01 lower at $0.55 in US dollars but still up 5% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 22.8% and GAAP EPS was USD 0.43, up 11% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.7 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $299 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 5% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.5 billion, up 5% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisition, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
For those of you curious about NetSuite, I can report that we have now cleared antitrust reviews everywhere, except the United States, where our waiting period expires at the end of September.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then some updated comments for the fiscal year. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. And while we feel good about our own performance and transformation, I am always keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad.
If current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see -- SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow, again, 78% to 82%, a little bit more than I guided last time. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 3%. EPS is expected to be between $0.59 and $0.62 in constant currency. Were it not for the higher tax rate and interest expense, we would expect EPS to grow approximately 4% or be $0.06 higher.
Over the full year of fiscal year '17, I'm raising the outlook for fiscal year '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 65% to 67%. I continue to expect the SaaS and PaaS gross margin will exit Q4 higher than the 62% reported today as our Cloud business continues to grow dramatically.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

I'm going to give you a lot of numbers. Let me start with booking and revenue growth rates. I'm going to give them to you year-on-year and CD, unless I state otherwise.
Cloud bookings ARR was USD 271 million, a 42% growth. As a reminder, ARR growth last year was 166%. SaaS bookings were USD 165 million. And PaaS/IaaS bookings were USD 106 million. As Safra said, SaaS/PaaS revenue was up 82%. I just want to repeat the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth acceleration.
Our ERP/EPM revenue grew 70% quarter-on-quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter with sequential growth that was greater than 50%. In Fusion HCM, we grew 131%, nearly 4x the growth rate of Workday.
And CX separately up double-digit in sales, marketing and service. Data as a Service was up 75%. Platform as a Service up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Overall, we grew 82%, the highest global growth rate at any scaled cloud company. SaaS/PaaS billings grew 49% in the quarter, up from 38% last quarter. Deferred SaaS/PaaS revenue was up 49%.
SaaS customer metrics. We closed 776 new SaaS customers in the quarter. We have 677 expansions. 125 customers who bought SaaS also about PaaS. 346 new CX customers, 488 expansions. 173 new HCM customers drove that great result, inclusive of 69 expansions. 344 ERP/EPM customers and 135 expansions. Our active base is now 2,800 customers with 1,000 live, 10x Workday. Over 50% of our ERP/EPM customers were net new to Oracle. They have never purchased an Oracle app before.
2/3 of our new customer wins were Fusion. 334 go-lives in Fusion, our best quarter ever. 2,032 PaaS customers that were new in the quarter. Our installed base is now 11,000 PaaS customers. 1,671 new Infrastructure as a Service customers that are supplemental to our PaaS customers. Together, our installed base of PaaS and Infrastructure is now at 18,892 customers. As a point of clarification, PaaS and Infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they use.
In closing, this was just a very solid quarter for us not only in revenue but bookings and billings. Look forward to few predictions. Q1 bookings were solid at 42%. I believe Q2 will be better, could even be much better. Q1 revenue was fantastic at 82%. It's one of the reasons, as Safra described, we're raising our guidance from 65% to 67%. I just want to close by saying we are the fastest-growing scaled cloud company in the world.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

We're very excited about the rollout of our Generation2 Infrastructure as a Service data centers. These new data centers give us the significant cost and performance advantage over Amazon Web Services. Plus our new BareMetal offering makes it possible for our customers to lift and shift their entire existing corporate infrastructure, data and applications without any changes whatsoever and move it to the Oracle Public Cloud. You just can't do that with Amazon Web Services, lift and shift the entire network, VM, database, data, applications, move all of that across to our data center without changing anything. So real advantage.
So for the first time, we have this big technology advantage in the Infrastructure as a Service. We expect this will enable Oracle to accelerate our Infrastructure as a Service business to the same high growth rates that we're currently experiencing in both SaaS and PaaS.
With that, we're ready for questions."

And as I've told most of you, that as we've gone through this cloud transition, we've got a pipeline and we understand now with -- as more data has come cleared to us how that translates to performance. And our performance continues to get better. And I think it's all of the things we've talked about. Not only have we got more salespeople than we had before. They're better trained. Our customers are more aware. We have more references. We have more go-lives. And all of that feeds together. In addition, we not only have more products. We're going to release more products yet even this week at -- or next week at Open World. But more of our existing products are available in more geographies. So for example, as we've released ERP, ERP actually has not been available in every geographic market in the world as it now is. So you've got a culmination of all of these factors that lead into it, but we are going to have a very strong bookings year, as I described."

From our perspective, it looks like over the past 2 years, we've seen Oracle make a large push away from perpetual licenses towards subscription-based SaaS offerings on the application side of the business. And now it appears that, that push is shifting more on the database tech side of the business, steering more business towards Platform as a Service.

So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were ready, we moved aggressively to sell those applications. We believe that's what customers wanted. They wanted cloud-based applications, not on-premise-based applications. We have made a 10-year -- we've made the huge investment in rewriting all of our applications. And those were ready before we -- and we were ready to move into SaaS applications. Before we were ready to move into Infrastructure as a Service or PaaS, we were just ready sooner. So we pushed back. The interest -- again, the interesting thing here is we are just beginning to move our database customers from on-premise into the cloud. Microsoft has already done a very good job of moving their Office customers from on-prem into the cloud, and that's the basis of -- the overwhelming basis of their cloud growth. The overwhelming basis of our cloud growth are new customers for applications. So we haven't started shifting our base yet, which I think is very interesting. We got these applications ready. We're gaining share right and left, as I say. We mention Workday a lot because they're our primary competitor for HCM and ERP in the cloud. And as Mark pointed out, we have 10x more -- we have 10x more customers than Workday in ERP. And we sold more. But those are -- more than half of those are net new customers, okay. So that's us gaining share in that business. We're now beginning to move our installed base into the cloud, and this is a lot of expansion. It's not like your stop running on-premise. We believe this is the next decade. This is a coexistence story. They're going to continue running some of their stuff on-premise, and they're going to move some of their stuff into the cloud, and those 2 things have to coexist. And our unique offering to our customers and database is the fact that we support the identical software on-premise and in the cloud. And you can move data and workloads back and forth very, very gracefully. That's our PaaS offering. And by the way, if you're a SaaS customer, your application is built on top of our database and our middleware. So you buy SaaS with PaaS. You often buy it together, as Mark pointed out. Finally, so PaaS was ready, and second, we're already -- we're moving aggressively in the PaaS. Now what we're looking for is the third leg of the stool, which is to push into Infrastructure as a Service, where we have an all new and very [indiscernible] competitor, Amazon.com. But we think now with our new Generation2 data centers, we have a big competitive advantage over Amazon.com. And people will be buying our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service together. So we sell PaaS twice. Sometimes we package PaaS with our application SaaS together, and this new business is selling PaaS with Infrastructure as a Service, where they're building a lot of custom applications or moving existing applications into the cloud. A way to think about it is our SaaS business is kind of a new business -- there's a lot of new customers. We're just beginning to shift our installed base from the on-premise into the cloud, which is enormous potential for us. And we think we make a lot more money by moving customers off premise into the cloud because we do a lot more things for the customer. We help the customers save money, but we also provide, with our database, storage and networking and compute and all of the associated support services. So we think, again, this is the beginning of still more rapid growth for Oracle."

Secondly, we think it's the way customers also want to buy now. But there is this transition that Larry talked about that we are going through.

So let me just address the accelerated buying experience because the most important part of it is that we end up being able to service our customers much more quickly, much more efficiently. Our salespeople become so much more productive. They can spend more of their time, really the bulk of their time, with customers outwardly facing, making them successful instead of inwardly facing, dealing with our own back office. So this has really unleashed a massive amount of productivity. Obviously, having many, many references is critical for the success of software service because customers all talk to each other and the happier customers lead to more happy customers, which is, by the way, one of the reasons we love Oracle Open World, because tens of thousands of our customers come and they share their positive experiences. And that just gets more and more customers excited and participating. And then, of course, the sales force has an enormous amount of success, which ends up leading to just more success, more productivity. The entire thing is just a very, very virtuous cycle, all of which starts with having the best product. That's really the bottom line, ultimately. As Larry mentioned, we spent a decade. Frankly, it's a little over a decade in building these products. We had leading products to begin with, but we started and rewrote them all, focused exclusively -- really focused on the cloud.

So it's a bit of a different story between us and Microsoft. That's exciting prospect of moving those Database customers to the cloud. That's in front of us."

This is actually the fact that we've done a very good job in the U.S. growing our cloud business. That's eventually had the strange effect of raising our tax rate, right? This is the best bad news you could get. So we're in a situation where I hate to say we've over-executed, but that's sort of how you feel. And yet to be clear, John, our bookings in Europe are very strong. And so this is going to normalize. This is just a point of us putting or moving those bookings into revenue. So in due course, as we have more balance between our international cloud sales and our U.S. cloud sales, the tax rate should drift back to where it normally is when we have the same mix. It's just now we have a disproportionate amount of our cloud revenue in the United States that we expect. That's the balance and then we expect tax rate to go back. For the bookings balance, it's just the current period revenue that we've got today. But this is overall a -- it might be a very good story. And let's not lose the fact of the other number that Safra described very early. Our margins are now at 62% in our SaaS/PaaS margins, which we talked about way back when they were at 39% as we were investing in infrastructure to prepare for what we have now. And so I think the margin story, John, is also beginning to solidify as we continue to grow and put revenue on top of the base."

We don't foresee that happening, okay, because the base is continuing to grow even though new license is -- new license amount is not growing year-over-year as much or is actually shrinking.

And also if I could ask you, Mark or Larry. On the PaaS side, can you just give us a little more color, what kind of projects are customers picking Oracle for when they sign a PaaS deal, particularly given that you surprised us with the announcement of the number of new customers for the PaaS?

So first, I mean, you really should take direction from what's going on in our gross profit line for the most strategic part of our business, which is moving to the cloud and software and Software as a Service. And that is going to be very much followed up. One of the things we do have that is costing us is that our hardware business outside of our Engineered Systems is getting smaller, and the expense line has not adjusted equally. As you can imagine, you know us pretty well, that's something that's very straightforward for us to finish out during the year. And that is our expectation. In addition, you also talked -- or you may have mentioned currency and tax and things like that. So obviously, currency is something I can't project. And I think after the Brexit vote, I'm pretty sure nobody else has projected it correctly either. But the way it affects us, just so that you know, is that the U.S. and Oracle is ahead of Europe in our move to the cloud and in -- outside of the United States. However, as Mark mentioned, the bookings are very, very high. So bookings that were booked in the United States over the past year are turning into revenue already in the United States. Since the number is smaller in Europe, the bookings -- the revenue numbers are smaller, the bookings are approaching those of the United States. And those are going to start flowing through revenues. That will, in fact, impact our tax rate and readjust it back to the lower rate that you may be used to. So that's going to take a little while and that should go through. In addition, as you know, we do have some significant borrowings. And as a result, we have a very large amount of cash on our balance sheet right now, which is not earning very high result. We are looking forward to closing the NetSuite deal, which we believe to be very -- to be accretive, and that will also be helpful."

Good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we overachieved again in the cloud, especially in the United States. As you all know, we have pivoted the organization to go after the cloud, and we are outperforming even our most aggressive expectation. This has resulted in our growth rate continuing to accelerate as we scale in the cloud, something our competitors are not similarly experiencing.
We continue to use constant-dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were more than expected, mostly because the surprise Brexit vote happened after our earnings call, resulting in a 1% to 3% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and EPS, which was $0.01 lower as a result.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $815 million, up 82% from last year and above the 80% high end of my guidance. While this excellent growth rate was helped a little by recent acquisitions, organic growth accelerated from both Q4 and Q1 of last year. Actually, organic SaaS and PaaS growth rate has accelerated for 7 straight quarters. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our Cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.5 billion, up 49% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 49% in U.S. dollars this quarter, up from 38% last quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
Our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point where the dollar growth in SaaS and PaaS revenue exceeded the dollar declines in new software license. Together, SaaS and PaaS subscriptions and new software license grew 16% in constant currency. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin also continues to expand. The Q1 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 62%, up from 40% last Q1. And we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year '17. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time.
Combined with Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, revenue of $171 million, which was up 10%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up 63% in constant currency from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $5.8 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high level as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1 billion, down 10%, reflecting the continued migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 11%, with hardware systems product revenue of $462 million and hardware support revenue of $535 million. Our Engineered Systems grew mid-double digits, led by Exadata that grew over 30% in the quarter.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.4 billion and operating margin was 39%.
I need to remind you that the large debt offering we did last quarter cost about $0.005 in EPS this quarter. The additional interest was not in my guidance as the debt offering took place after the guidance call. For Q2, I expect the add-in interest will lower EPS by more than $0.01, without the matching benefit of NetSuite's contribution to earnings, which will be accretive until the deal closes.
G&A expenses were also higher than usual in Q1 because of some legal fees, which will be lower in the second quarter and largely gone by Q3 as a result of the settlement of 1 case and the end of 2 trials.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was higher than projected due to the geographic mix of earnings, which is driven by our overachievement in cloud revenues in the U.S., resulting in a tax rate of 25.5%, and EPS being $0.01 lower at $0.55 in US dollars but still up 5% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 22.8% and GAAP EPS was USD 0.43, up 11% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.7 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $299 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 5% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.5 billion, up 5% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
For those of you curious about NetSuite, I can report that we have now cleared antitrust reviews everywhere, except the United States, where our waiting period expires at the end of September.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then some updated comments for the fiscal year. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. And while we feel good about our own performance and transformation, I am always keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad.
If current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see -- SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow, again, 78% to 82%, a little bit more than I guided last time. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 3%. EPS is expected to be between $0.59 and $0.62 in constant currency. Were it not for the higher tax rate and interest expense, we would expect EPS to grow approximately 4% or be $0.06 higher.
Over the full year of fiscal year '17, I'm raising the outlook for fiscal year '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 65% to 67%. I continue to expect the SaaS and PaaS gross margin will exit Q4 higher than the 62% reported today as our Cloud business continues to grow dramatically.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

I'm going to give you a lot of numbers. Let me start with booking and revenue growth rates. I'm going to give them to you year-on-year and CD, unless I state otherwise. Cloud bookings ARR was USD 271 million, a 42% growth. As a reminder, ARR growth last year was 166%. SaaS bookings were USD 165 million. And PaaS/IaaS bookings were USD 106 million. As Safra said, SaaS/PaaS revenue was up 82%. I just want to repeat the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth acceleration.
Our ERP/EPM revenue grew 70% quarter-on-quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter with sequential growth that was greater than 50%. In Fusion HCM, we grew 131%, nearly 4x the growth rate of Workday.
And CX separately up double-digit in sales, marketing and service. Data as a Service was up 75%. Platform as a Service, up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Overall, we grew 82%, the highest global growth rate at any scaled cloud company. SaaS/PaaS billings grew 49% in the quarter, up from 38% last quarter. Deferred SaaS/PaaS revenue was up 49%.
SaaS customer metrics. We closed 776 new SaaS customers in the quarter. We had 677 expansions. 125 customers who bought SaaS also about PaaS. 346 new CX customers, 488 expansions. 173 new HCM customers drove that great result, inclusive of 69 expansions. 344 ERP/EPM customers and 135 expansions. Our active base is now 2,800 customers with 1,000 live, 10x Workday. Over 50% of our ERP/EPM customers were net new to Oracle. They have never purchased an Oracle app before.
2/3 of our new customer wins were Fusion. 334 go-lives in Fusion, our best quarter ever. 2,032 PaaS customers that were new in the quarter. Our installed base is now 11,000 PaaS customers. 1,671 new Infrastructure as a Service customers that are supplemental to our PaaS customers. Together, our installed base of PaaS and Infrastructure is now at 18,892 customers. As a point of clarification, PaaS and Infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they use.
In closing, this was just a very solid quarter for us not only in revenue but bookings and billings. Look forward to few predictions. Q1 bookings were solid at 42%. I believe Q2 will be better, could even be much better. Q1 revenue was fantastic at 82%. It's one of the reasons, as Safra described, we're raising our guidance from 65% to 67%. I just want to close by saying we are the fastest-growing scaled cloud company in the world.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

It's a real advantage.
So for the first time, we have this big technology advantage in the Infrastructure as a Service. We expect this will enable Oracle to accelerate our Infrastructure as a Service business to the same high growth rates that we're currently experiencing in both SaaS and PaaS.

Our customers are more aware. We have more references. We have more go-lives. And all of that feeds together. In addition, we not only have more products. We're going to release more products yet even this week at -- or next week at Open World. But more of our existing products are available in more geographies.

The -- we started our Fusion applications efforts a little over 10 years ago. So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were ready, we moved aggressively to sell thos",647,"Okay. This is Larry. The -- we started our Fusion applications efforts a little over 10 years ago. So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were ready, we moved aggressively to sell those applications. We believe that's what customers wanted. They wanted cloud-based applications, not on-premise-based applications. We have made a 10-year -- we've made the huge investment of rewriting all of our applications. And those were ready before we -- and we were ready to move into SaaS applications before we were ready to move into Infrastructure as a Service or PaaS. We were just ready sooner. So we pushed back. The interest -- again, the interesting thing here is we are just beginning to move our database customers from on-premise into the cloud. Microsoft has already done a very good job of moving their Office customers from on-prem into the cloud, and that's the basis of -- the overwhelming basis of their cloud growth. The overwhelming basis of our cloud growth are new customers for applications. So we haven't started shifting our base yet, which I think is very interesting. We got these applications ready. We're gaining share right and left, as I say. We mention Workday a lot because they're our primary competitor for HCM and ERP in the cloud. And as Mark pointed out, we have 10x more -- we've got 10x more customers than Workday has in ERP. And we've sold more. But those are -- more than half of those are net new customers, okay. So that's us gaining share in that business. We're now beginning to move our installed base into the cloud, and this is a lot of expansion. It's not like they're going to stop running on-premise. We believe this is for the next decade. This is a coexistence story. They're going to continue running some of their stuff on-premise, and they're going to move some of their stuff into the cloud, and those 2 things have to coexist. And our unique offering to our customers and database is the fact that we support the identical software on-premise with and in the cloud. And you can move data and workloads back and forth very, very gracefully. That's our PaaS offering. And by the way, if you're a SaaS customer, your application is built on top of our database and our middleware. So you buy SaaS with PaaS. You often buy it together, as Mark pointed out. Finally, so PaaS was ready; second, we were ready -- we're moving aggressively into PaaS. Now what we're looking for is the third leg of the stool, which is to push into Infrastructure as a Service, where we have an all new and very [indiscernible] competitor, Amazon.com. But we think now with our new Generation2 data centers, we have a big competitive advantage over Amazon.com. And people will be buying our PaaS and our Infrastructure as a Service together. So we sell PaaS twice. Sometimes we package PaaS with our application SaaS together, and this new business is selling PaaS with Infrastructure as a Service, where they're building a lot of custom applications or moving existing applications into the cloud. A way to think about it is our SaaS business is kind of a new business -- there's a lot of new customers. We're just beginning to shift our installed base from the on-premise into the cloud, which is enormous potential for us. And we think we make a lot more money by moving customers off premise into the cloud because we do a lot more things for the customer. We help the customers save money, but we also provide, with our database, storage and networking and compute and all of the associated support services. So we think, again, this is the beginning of still more rapid growth for Oracle."

So let me just address the accelerated buying experience because the most important part of it is that we end up being able to service our customers much more quickly, much more efficiently. Our salespeople become so much more productive. They can spend more of their time, really the bulk of their time, with customers outwardly facing, making them successful instead of inwardly facing, dealing with our own back office. So this has really unleashed a massive amount of productivity. Obviously, having many, many references is critical for the success of software service because customers all talk to each other and the happier customers lead to more happy customers, which is, by the way, one of the reasons we love Oracle Open World, because tens of thousands of our customers come and they share their positive experiences. And that just gets more and more customers excited and participating. And then, of course, the sales force has an enormous amount of success, which ends up leading to just more success, more productivity. The entire thing is just a very, very virtuous cycle, all of which starts with having the best product. That's really the bottom line, ultimately. As Larry mentioned, we spent a decade. Frankly, it's a little over a decade in building these products. We had leading products to begin with, but we started and rewrote them all, focused exclusively -- really focused on the cloud.

So these are really new customers, and then to your point, that are bringing new workloads that we have not had before. The exciting part, which again I'll go back to what Larry said, was the core of our on-prem user base, particularly in the database arena, has not moved.

And yet to be clear, John, our bookings in Europe are very strong. And so this is going to normalize. This is just a point of us putting or moving those bookings into revenue. So in due course, as we have more balance between our international cloud sales and our U.S. cloud sales, the tax rate should drift back to where it normally is when we have the same mix. It's just now we have a disproportionate amount of our cloud revenue in the United States that we expect. That's the balance and then we expect tax rate to go back. For the bookings balance, it's just the current period revenue that we've got today. But this is overall a -- it might be a very good story. And let's not lose the fact of the other number that Safra described very early. Our margins are now at 62% in our SaaS/PaaS margins, which we talked about way back when they were at 39% as we were investing in infrastructure to prepare for what we have now. And so I think the margin story, John, is also beginning to solidify as we continue to grow and put revenue on top of the base."

Now I know you're probably worried that all of a sudden support is going to go negative, the base is going to go negative. We don't foresee that happening, okay, because the base is continuing to grow even though new license is -- new license amount is not growing year-over-year as much or is actually shrinking, as more of our customers pivot to the cloud, we still sell new licenses, which means the base does continue to grow, and it grew 3% year-over-year.

And also if I could ask you, Mark or Larry, on the PaaS side, can you just give us a little bit more color? What kind of projects are customers picking Oracle for when they sign a PaaS deal, particularly given that you've surprised us with the announcement of the number of new customers for the PaaS?

So first, I mean, you really should take direction from what's going on in our gross profit line for the most strategic part of our business, which is moving to the cloud and software and Software as a Service. And that is going to be very much followed up. One of the things we do have that is costing us is that our hardware business outside of our Engineered Systems is getting smaller, and the expense line has not adjusted equally. As you can imagine, you know us pretty well, that's something that's very straightforward for us to finish out during the year. And that is our expectation. In addition, you also talked -- or you may have mentioned currency and tax and things like that. So obviously, currency is something I can't project. And I think after the Brexit vote, I'm pretty sure nobody else has projected it correctly either. But the way it affects us, just so that you know, is that the U.S. at Oracle is ahead of Europe in our move to the cloud and in -- outside of the United States. However, as Mark mentioned, the bookings are very, very high. So bookings that were booked in the United States over the past year are turning into revenue already in the United States. Since the number is smaller in Europe, the bookings -- the revenue numbers are smaller, the bookings are approaching those of the United States. And those are going to start flowing through revenues. That will, in fact, impact our tax rate and readjust it back to the lower rates that you may be used to. So that's going to take a little while and that should go through. In addition, as you know, we do have some significant borrowings. And as a result, we have a very large amount of cash on our balance sheet right now, which is not earning very high result. We are looking forward to closing the NetSuite deal, which we believe to be very -- to be accretive, and that will also be helpful."

So SaaS, you buy a number of SaaS application or a suite of SaaS applications and you buy a certain amount of PaaS to extend it, build data marks, data warehouses, other things, to add features and functions, use PaaS for that. Also, the bigger opportunity is when you buy PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service together where you're either writing brand-new, net new custom applications or you're lifting and shifting an existing custom application to our Infrastructure as a Service and then moving the database associated with that application to our PaaS, that's actually the bigger opportunity.

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. I'll then review guidance for Q3 as well as give some direction on FY '17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year when the transition would be largely complete.
While the investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud had limited our ability to expand earnings per share near term, they've been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results in EPS and cash flows that grow even faster. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in a currency headwind of 1% of total revenue, 2% in some revenue category and $0.01 to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second $0.01. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $912 million, up 89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail as usual.
When you add together Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software license revenue, they grew 5% in constant currency. And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue together also grew. These are significant milestones in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses, added together, are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4. And from there, we'll be targeting 80%.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now that's lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments to scale out this business.
Now I want to [ph] spend a moment explaining it to you because you're going to see some effects. What's happening with the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin except that it's off a much smaller revenue base, and thus, the margin impact is more at the beginning.
To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS, PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale-out, the gross margin declined 15 percentage points before bottoming at 40%. It's now up to 61% and as I just mentioned, will climb to 80% over time.
Similarly, I expect the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin will decline further over the next few quarters as we make investments in the business that hit our expenses immediately, while the revenue is recognized over time. But for modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin, probably doesn't need to go quite that low, but just for modeling purposes, you can aim there. After which, I expect the gross margins will climb to minimally 40% as the business scales, probably higher.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our installed base of customers continues to grow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion. Now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system products revenue of $497 million and hardware support revenue of $517 million. We are proactive in -- just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue declines and the new availability of IaaS for those customers.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year, and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, considerably higher than last year's 20.4%, which had been favorably impacted by some onetime benefit.
Now in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effect -- favorable impacts to our tax rate over time is higher but obviously not certain.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was USD 0.61. The GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. The GAAP EPS was USD 0.48. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditure for Q2 were $757 million with cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total, with the rest being real estate.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $58 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position's approximately $4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency.
This quarter, we purchased nearly 13 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarters due obviously to the use of our cash for the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year. Given recent currency movements, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds. Today again was a very significant day in currency with the dollar strengthening.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right now we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 82% to 86%; Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 4% to 6%; Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%; EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%, which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year.
As a reminder, last year's tax rate was lower mostly due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year FY '17, I'm raising the outlook for FY '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80% with NetSuite now added and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion with over half of it being due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that will not be repeating next year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry -- to Mark for his comments."

Service was up 24%; Data as a Service, up 71%; Database as a Service, up 700% and already at $100 million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600%, and overall SaaS, PaaS grew 89%. SaaS, PaaS billings grew 39% in USD; SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue, 51% in USD.
Now just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimates, and Oracle is now the #1 market share leader in enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers, 1,082 to be exact and had 810 expansions. In CX, we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM, we had 224 new customers and 212 expansions. In ERP, we had 532 new customers, and that does not include NetSuite. We got 91 expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought this quarter.
Our active base now, 3,269 customers with 1,275 live, over 10x greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost 13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite. Fusion Cloud is now nearly 2/3 of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us because it was 10 years actually writing this code and is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go lives, best quarter ever. 2,116 customers are now live on Fusion.
We got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter, and our installed base now sits at 12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers. They are buying stand-alone infrastructure services, and together, our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now as a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that's used.
Now let me just give you names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just a couple of pillars. First in ERP. So I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter. Tenet, Deutsche Telekom, Dick's Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Coke Industries, Noble Energy, RECO, Skanska, Texas Instruments. 
I'm going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter: Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser Foundation hospitals, Netgear, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, the Hearst Corporation. It was a solid quarter for us. 
And lastly, let me just sort of describe where I think we are. We not only had strong revenue and billings as well but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%. Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2 revenue was fantastic at 89% and we've clearly caught -- caused a revenue chasm. We're clearly the fastest-growing cloud company at scale. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Historically, I've measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our 2 primary competitors: SAP in Applications and IBM in infrastructure and database. 
That changed as we move to the cloud. In the cloud, we measure Oracle against Salesforce.com in application and Amazon Web Services in infrastructure and database. Our cloud application's goal is to be the world's largest and most profitable SaaS company. We are growing our Cloud business much faster than salesforce.com, and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark but it's going to be close. 
IDC already recognizes Oracle as the #1 in annual SaaS sales to large enterprises. Salesforce.com is #2. We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than Salesforce.com. We are catching up to them and we're catching them very quickly. 
Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be #1 running database workloads in the cloud on our Infrastructure as a Service. The Oracle Database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web Services databases, Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Service runs the Oracle Database workloads much faster, more reliably and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle Database running at Amazon's IaaS.
We are making a multiyear generational shift to the cloud, and we're well on our way to being #1 in both cloud applications and cloud database. And we're doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash flow.
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

I think before I go to the hardware thing, our renewal rates in software for the quarter, we usually just tell you they're about the same. To be very exact, it actually went up. So our cancellation rates were down in the quarter. So we have a very strong renewal rate in our software business. Now that said, we are actually, in many cases, trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means for us more money. That means for us more margin. So it is clearly our objective over time, let's take the applications business to migrate our on-prem applications customers to our cloud applications. And as Larry mentioned, our database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform. And we believe, as you all very well -- most of you at least very well know the math, that means for us a larger recurring revenue stream. And as our margins continue to climb, that means more earnings for us and we think a great experience for our customers as well. Hardware, really more of what we've talked about, sort of the reason we haven't talked about it much, we had a very good Engineered Systems quarter again. Engineered Systems grew in both bookings and revenue in the quarter. That ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us, does a great job for us. We had declines in what you would think of as our traditional server business. And those declines offset the growth in Engineered Systems. So it's really the tail of sort of 2 product lines, Engineered Systems growing, the traditional server product line declining. Now this is the last quarter, this being Q2, that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we bought a couple of MICROS, for example, a couple of years ago, 1.5 years ago. It had a bunch of third-party products that we actually stopped, and that's actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line. That begins to end as we go into Q3. So those are sort of the 3 factors, the third-party products and our MICROS business, growth in Engineered Systems and decline in the traditional services."

And as apps has gotten smaller, the base itself is not decline -- is small but when it declines, it has a smaller impact on our overall new software license. Now ultimately, at one point, you'll see the same happening in database, but the reality is you're not seeing it in database at this time because our installed base of usage continues to increase at all levels, on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously."

I could answer it anyway. So let me be clear. So if you convert, if you move the Oracle E-Business Suite on-premise and then you take up Fusion ERP in the cloud, and we encourage you to do that, right, [indiscernible] that, you cancel your support for the Oracle ERP on-premise or what we call the E-Business Suite, and you start paying us a monthly fee for Fusion, okay. So even support, not only does new license go down but even support goes down because you make the shift and we want you to do that because we make a lot more money that way. However, in database, if you bring database to Infrastructure as a Service, you need to own the database license. You never cancel your database license and support. That goes on forever. So as the people migrate, let's say, you take the Oracle Database to Oracle Infrastructure as a Service, you still pay your support. And if you need more, you buy more -- license more database. Let's say you take the Oracle Database to Amazon. Well, you need your Oracle Database and you need to -- we need more -- you got to buy more of it and license more of it, and you have to keep paying support. So they're very different businesses. They've got to be -- they're profiled very, very differently. So as Safra said, a lot of license decline is attributable to our applications business, which is getting -- of which the on-prem application business is getting smaller and smaller. The database business, license business is growing. So these are -- this will be -- both these businesses will react very differently in the cloud. Very -- it's not an unlikely outcome that our database license business goes on forever, and the associated support goes on forever even though customers are running that, that database now not on their own computers but on our Infrastructure as a Service or Amazon's Infrastructure as a Service or Azure's Infrastructure as a Service, so you have to model these 2 businesses entirely differently."

By the way, just to be clear to the CTO's earlier point, as it relates to apps and applications business, we actually don't compensate our sales people for applications on-premise. So just to be clear, to connect these dots in terms of how we actually operationalize the company, our sales people in the applications ecosystem sell SaaS. So if they sell -- we have small SWAT teams in our what we would call Oracle direct organization that really help our existing users by incremental seats if they need to do their existing on-premise applications. So I only say that to you because all of this is plainful on our part. Our objective is to move to SaaS, to get as clear about our direction of SaaS, and it's resulted in this leadership position enterprise SaaS that we discussed earlier. So this is all very plainful on our part. To your question about the regions, all of our regions -- the region that had the toughest time in the quarter was Latin America. And Latin America is -- have been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of our team, et cetera. But they're going through all of the things that you all know about. In Brazil, some of the issues that have cropped up now in Mexico. But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of a tough time, they are gaining significant market share in that market. So I -- while the numbers in Latin America are perhaps not as good as we all would love or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers is fantastic. So I'm actually very proud of them in spite of the fact that the absolute dollar value that Say that, our Europe and North America regions performed roughly as I would have expected. I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years. They -- in addition, they've done a tremendous move over to cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis, just taking license and cloud combined, grew. So very significant. I'm pleased with North America as well. I mean, they were roughly as we expected. On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turnaround. It wasn't a couple of years ago, we'd sit on a call and get questions about some of the performance in Asia. We weren't fairly happy with that, we made some changes and I think the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see, I'm talking about hardware, SaaS, passing for structure and license has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia. Double-digit."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. I'll then review guidance for Q3 as well as give some direction on FY '17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year when the transition would be largely complete.
While the investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud had limited our ability to expand earnings per share near term, they've been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results in EPS and cash flows that grow even faster. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in a currency headwind of 1% of total revenue, 2% in some revenue category and $0.01 to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second $0.01. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $912 million, up 89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail as usual.
When you add together Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software license revenue, they grew 5% in constant currency. And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue together also grew. These are significant milestones in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses, added together, are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4. And from there, we'll be targeting 80%.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now that's lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments to scale out this business.
Now I want to spend a moment explaining it to you because you're going to see some effects. What's happening with the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin except that it's off a much smaller revenue base, and thus, the margin impact is more at the beginning.
To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS, PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale-out, the gross margin declined 15 percentage points before bottoming at 40%. It's now up to 61% and as I just mentioned, will climb to 80% over time.
Similarly, I expect the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin will decline further over the next few quarters as we make investments in the business that hit our expenses immediately, while the revenue is recognized over time. But for modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin, probably doesn't need to go quite that low, but just for modeling purposes, you can aim there. After which, I expect the gross margins will climb to minimally 40% as the business scales, probably higher.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our installed base of customers continues to grow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion. Now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system products revenue of $497 million and hardware support revenue of $517 million. We are proactive in -- just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue declines and the new availability of IaaS for those customers.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year, and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, considerably higher than last year's 20.4%, which had been favorably impacted by some onetime benefit.
Now in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effect -- favorable impacts to our tax rate over time is higher but obviously not certain.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was USD 0.61. The GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. The GAAP EPS was USD 0.48. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditure for Q2 were $757 million with cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total, with the rest being real estate.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $58 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position's approximately $4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency.
This quarter, we purchased nearly 13 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarters due obviously to the use of our cash for the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year. Given recent currency movements, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds. Today again was a very significant day in currency with the dollar strengthening.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right now we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 82% to 86%; Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 4% to 6%; Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%; EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%, which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year.
As a reminder, last year's tax rate was lower mostly due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year FY '17, I'm raising the outlook for FY '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80% with NetSuite now added and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion with over half of it being due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that will not be repeating next year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry -- to Mark for his comments."

As usual, I'm just going to give you a slew of numbers here and try to give you some context on our quarter. Everything's year-on-year and CD unless I say otherwise. Cloud bookings for the quarter, USD 377 million. Now Q2 was the best non-Q4 we have ever had, and I'll make a prediction that Q3 has a chance to be our best ever quarter, period.
SaaS bookings were USD 217 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 160 million. Now just let me give you some numbers by pillar as it relates to our SaaS, PaaS revenue. We were up 89%, more than 30% higher than Amazon, Salesforce or Workday. ERP had 104% growth quarter-on-quarter, eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth greater than 50%. HCM grew 131% again this quarter. That's 4x the growth rate of Workday. CX, Customer Experience, grew 15% organically. Service was up 24%; Data as a Service, up 71%; Database as a Service, up 700% and already at $100 million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600%, and overall SaaS, PaaS grew 89%. SaaS, PaaS billings grew 39% in USD; SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue, 51% in USD.
Now just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimates, and Oracle is now the #1 market share leader in enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers, 1,082 to be exact and had 810 expansions. In CX, we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM, we had 224 new customers and 212 expansions. In ERP, we had 532 new customers, and that does not include NetSuite. We got 91 expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought this quarter.
Our active base now, 3,269 customers with 1,275 live, over 10x greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost 13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite. Fusion Cloud is now nearly 2/3 of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us because it was 10 years actually writing this code and is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go lives, best quarter ever. 2,116 customers are now live on Fusion.
We got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter, and our installed base now sits at 12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers. They are buying stand-alone infrastructure services, and together, our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now as a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that's used.
Now let me just give you names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just a couple of pillars. First in ERP. So I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter: Canon, Deutsche Telekom, Dick's Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Hill-Rom, Koch Industries, Noble Energy, RIICO [ph] , Skanska, Texas Instruments.
I'm going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter: Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Netgear, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, the Hearst Corporation. It was a solid quarter for us.
And lastly, let me just sort of describe where I think we are. We not only had strong revenue and billings as well, but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%. Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2 revenue was fantastic at 89%, and we've clearly caught -- crossed the revenue chasm. We are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Historically, I've measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our 2 primary competitors: SAP in applications and IBM in infrastructure and database.
That changed as we move to the cloud. In the cloud, we measure Oracle against Salesforce.com in applications and Amazon Web Services in infrastructure and database. Our cloud application's goal is to be the world's largest and most profitable SaaS company. We are growing our cloud business much faster than Salesforce.com, and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark. But it's going to be close.
IDC already recognizes Oracle as the #1 in annual SaaS sales to large enterprises. Salesforce.com is #2. We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than Salesforce.com. We are catching up to them, and we're catching them very quickly.
Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be #1 running database workloads in the cloud on our Infrastructure as a Service. The Oracle Database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web Services databases, Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Service runs the Oracle Database workloads much faster, more reliably and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle Database running at Amazon's IaaS.
We are making a multi-year generational shift to the cloud, and we're well on our way to being #1 in both cloud applications and cloud database. And we're doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash flow.
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

Mark, our field checks this quarter led us to believe that cloud traction accelerated beyond what you had been doing, which was pretty good -- very good. And we thought this might have a negative effect on license, which sort of comes through in the increased decline in license. But with ARR growth of 30%, I'm not sure -- that doesn't seem to be indicative of increasing cloud traction. Can you help us resolve this? I mean, what we're hearing in the field and the numbers, what the numbers seem to indicate, is it as simple as 30% ARR growth may not be the 42% last quarter but it's still pretty good off such a large number? Or is there something else going on?"

Our pipeline is really big. Our wins are pretty big -- or quite big as well. Not -- as I mentioned in my script, and I may have gone over it too fast, first of all, we had a good quarter in ARR. So these are the days when 30% growth, gee, I wish it was higher. I like 30% growth. That said, we can do a lot better. And what I said about Q3 -- so Q2, just to go back to that number, is the best non-Q4 we have ever had in terms of bookings. I think there's a chance, and I'll repeat it again, Q3 is the best quarter we've ever had -- we could ever have, period. That's how good I feel about our pipeline, how good I feel about our position, deals that -- I don't usually talk about deals we've won in early Q3, but that's how strong our position is going into the quarter. And my guess, John, is that's why you hear what you hear from your field checks, is deals we've won. We may not have contracted it, put on a piece of paper, but we feel really strong about our position. Larry talked about the $2 billion for the full year. So that would be my response, John."

And it really pulls together all the various organizations around the company that had touched our cloud customers and brings them together into an organizational unit, focused solely on pleasing and delighting our customers and giving them the absolute best customer experience they can possibly have.

If you want to move existing database workloads to the cloud and minimize the changes customers have to make as they migrate, in other words, make it a graceful, easy lift and shift, we can configure our cloud network to match their network. We can configure other servers to match their -- the capacity of their servers, configure storage, get -- deliver Exadata service, do all of that with virtually no disruption to what they're doing. They press a button, move their database, move their workloads, and it just runs pretty much like the way it ran. They don't have to retest the application. They just move it, and it will just run. Then, we absolutely need an Infrastructure as a Service in combination with our Platform as a Service. We need both of them to do that gracefully. So it isn't essential. We've been -- and this infrastructure as a business technology development phase for a long time, we're rolling it out to customers. Again, early days but it's being very, very well received. Of course, the litmus test is can we do it better than Amazon. Could our Infrastructure as a -- big question. Can Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service differentiate itself from Amazon? Can we do it more gracefully, more reliably, less expensively, more securely than Amazon can? And we think we can, and that's going to make us very, very competitive."

Now that said, we are actually, in many cases, trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means for us more money. That means for us more margin. So it is clearly our objective over time, let's take the applications business, to migrate our on-prem applications customers to our cloud applications and as Larry mentioned, our database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform. And we believe, as you all very well -- most of you at least very well know the math, that means for us a larger recurring revenue stream. And as our margins continue to climb, that means more earnings for us and we think a great experience for our customers as well. Hardware, really more of what we've talked about. Sort of the reason we haven't talked about it much, we had a very good Engineered Systems quarter again. Engineered Systems grew in both bookings and revenue in the quarter. That ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us, does a great job for us. We had declines in what you would think of as our traditional server business. And those declines offset the growth in Engineered Systems. So it's really the tail of sort of 2 product lines, Engineered Systems growing, the traditional server product line declining. Now this is the last quarter, this being Q2, that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we bought a couple of -- MICROS, for example, a couple of years ago, 1.5 years ago. It had a bunch of third-party products that we actually stopped, and that's actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line. That begins to end as we go into Q3. So those are sort of the 3 factors, the third-party products in our MICROS business, growth in Engineered Systems and decline in the traditional services."

However, in database, if you bring database to Infrastructure as a Service, you need to own the database license. You never cancel your database license and support. That goes on forever. So as people migrate, let's say, you take the Oracle Database to Oracle Infrastructure as a Service, you still pay your support. And if you need more, you buy more -- license more database. Let's say you take the Oracle Database to Amazon. Well, you need your Oracle Database, and you need to -- you need more of it. You got to buy more of it and license more of it, and you have to keep paying support. So they're very different businesses. They've got to be -- they're profiled very, very differently. So as Safra said, a lot of license decline is attributable to our applications business, which is getting -- of which the on-prem application business is getting smaller and smaller. The database business, license business is growing. So these are very -- these will react -- both these businesses will react very differently in the cloud, very -- it's not an unlikely outcome that our database license business goes on forever, and the associated support goes on forever even though customers are running that, that database now not on their own computers but on our Infrastructure as a Service or Amazon's Infrastructure as a Service or Azure's Infrastructure as a Service. So you have to model these 2 businesses entirely differently."

By the way, just to be clear to the CTO's earlier point, as it relates to apps and applications business, we actually don't compensate our salespeople for applications on-premise. So just to be clear, to connect these dots in terms of how we actually operationalize the company, our salespeople in the applications ecosystem sell SaaS. So if they sell -- we have small SWAT teams in our, what we would call, our Oracle Direct organization that really help our existing users buy incremental seats if they need to, to their existing on-premise applications. So I only say that to you because all of this is planful on our part. Our objective is to move to SaaS, to get as clear about our direction of SaaS, and it's resulted in this leadership position enterprise SaaS that we discussed earlier. So this is all very planful on our part. To your question about the regions, all of our regions -- the region that had the toughest time in the quarter was Latin America. And Latin America is -- have been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of our team, et cetera, but they're going through all of the things that you all know about. In Brazil, some of the issues that have crept up now in Mexico. But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of a tough time, they are gaining significant market share in that market. So I -- while the numbers in Latin America are more perhaps not as good as we all would love or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers is fantastic. So I'm actually very proud of them in spite of the fact that the absolute dollar value that say -- say that our Europe and North America regions performed roughly as I would have expected. I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years. They -- in addition, they've done a tremendous move over to cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis, just taking license and cloud combined, grew, so very significant. I'm pleased with North America as well. I mean, they were roughly as we expected. On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turnaround. It wasn't a couple years ago, we'd sit on a call and get questions about some of the performance in Asia. We weren't very happy with that. We made some changes, and I think the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see. I'm talking about hardware, SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure and license has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia, double digit."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. I'll then review guidance for Q3 as well as give some direction on FY '17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year when the transition would be largely complete.
While the investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud had limited our ability to expand earnings per share near term, they've been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results in EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in a currency headwind of 1% of total revenue, 2% in some revenue categories and $0.01 to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second $0.01. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $912 million, up 89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail as usual.
When you add together Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software license revenue, they grew 5% in constant currency. And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue together also grew. These are significant milestones in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses, added together, are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4. And from there, we'll be targeting 80%.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now that's lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments to scale out this business.
Now I want to spend a moment explaining it to you because you're going to see some effects. What's happening with the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin except that it's off a much smaller revenue base, and thus, the margin impact is more at the beginning.
To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS, PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale-out, the gross margin declined 15 percentage points before bottoming at 40%. It's now up to 61% and as I just mentioned, will climb to 80% over time.
Similarly, I expect the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin will decline further over the next few quarters as we make investments in the business that hit our expenses immediately, while the revenue is recognized over time. But for modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin, probably doesn't need to go quite that low, but just for modeling purposes, you can aim there. After which, I expect the gross margins will climb to minimally 40% as the business scales, probably higher.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our installed base of customers continues to grow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion. Now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system products' revenue of $497 million and hardware support revenue of $517 million. We are proactive in -- just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue declines and the new availability of IaaS for those customers.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year, and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, considerably higher than last year's 20.4%, which had been favorably impacted by some onetime benefits.
Now in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effect -- favorable impacts to our tax rate over time is higher but obviously not certain.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was USD 0.61. The GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. The GAAP EPS was USD 0.48. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditure for Q2 were $757 million with cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total, with the rest being real estate.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $58 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency.
This quarter, we purchased nearly 13 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarters due obviously to the use of our cash for the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year. Given recent currency movements, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds. Today again was a very significant day in currency with the dollar strengthening.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right now we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 82% to 86%; Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 4% to 6%; Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%; EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%, which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year.
As a reminder, last year's tax rate was lower mostly due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year FY '17, I'm raising the outlook for FY '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80% with NetSuite now added and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion with over half of it being due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that will not be repeating next year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry -- to Mark for his comments."

Cloud bookings for the quarter, USD 377 million. Now Q2 was the best non-Q4 we have ever had, and I'll make a prediction that Q3 has a chance to be our best ever quarter, period.
SaaS bookings were USD 217 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 160 million. Now just let me give you some numbers by pillar as it relates to our SaaS, PaaS revenue. We were up 89%, more than 30% higher than Amazon, Salesforce or Workday. ERP had 104% growth quarter-on-quarter, eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth greater than 50%. HCM grew 131% again this quarter. That's 4x the growth rate of Workday. CX, Customer Experience, grew 15% organically. Service was up 24%; Data as a Service, up 71%; Database as a Service, up 700% and already at $100 million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600%, and overall SaaS, PaaS grew 89%. SaaS, PaaS billings grew 39% in USD; SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue, 51% in USD.
Now just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimates, and Oracle is now the #1 market share leader in enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers, 1,082 to be exact and had 810 expansions. In CX, we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM, we had 224 new customers and 212 expansions. In ERP, we had 532 new customers, and that does not include NetSuite. We got 91 expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought this quarter.
Our active base now, 3,269 customers with 1,275 live, over 10x greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost 13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite. Fusion Cloud is now nearly 2/3 of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us because it was 10 years actually writing this code and is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go-lives, best quarter ever. 2,116 customers are now live on Fusion.
We got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter, and our installed base now sits at 12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers. They are buying stand-alone infrastructure services, and together, our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now as a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that's used.
Now let me just give you names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just a couple of pillars. First in ERP. So I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter: Canon, Deutsche Telekom, Dick's Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Hill-Rom, Koch Industries, Noble Energy, RIICO [ph] , Skanska, Texas Instruments.
I'm going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter: Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Netgear, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, the Hearst Corporation. It was a solid quarter for us.
And lastly, let me just sort of describe where I think we are. We not only had strong revenue and billings as well, but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%. Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2 revenue was fantastic at 89%, and we've clearly caught -- crossed the revenue chasm. We are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Historically, I've measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our 2 primary competitors: SAP in applications and IBM in infrastructure and database.
That changed as we moved to the cloud. In the cloud, we measure Oracle against Salesforce.com in applications and Amazon Web Services in infrastructure and database. Our cloud application's goal is to be the world's largest and most profitable SaaS company. We are growing our cloud business much faster than Salesforce.com, and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark. But it's going to be close.
IDC already recognizes Oracle as the #1 in annual SaaS sales to large enterprises. Salesforce.com is #2. We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than Salesforce.com. We are catching up to them, and we're catching them very quickly.
Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be #1 running database workloads in the cloud on our Infrastructure as a Service. The Oracle Database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web Services databases, Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Service runs the Oracle Database workloads much faster, more reliably and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle Database running at Amazon's IaaS.
We are making a multi-year generational shift to the cloud, and we're well on our way to being #1 in both cloud applications and cloud database. And we're doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash flow.
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

And it really pulls together all the various organizations around the company that had touched our cloud customers and brings them together into an organizational unit, focused solely on pleasing and delighting our customers and giving them the absolute best customer experience they can possibly have.

If you want to move existing database workloads to the cloud and minimize the changes customers have to make as they migrate, in other words, make it a graceful, easy lift and shift, we can configure our cloud network to match their network. We can configure other servers to match their -- the capacity of their servers, configure storage, get -- deliver Exadata service, do all of that with virtually no disruption to what they're doing. They press a button, move their database, move their workloads, and it just runs pretty much like the way it ran. They don't have to retest the application. They just move it, and it will just run. Then, we absolutely need an Infrastructure as a Service in combination with our Platform as a Service. We need both of them to do that gracefully. So it isn't essential. We've been -- and this infrastructure as a business technology development phase for a long time, we're rolling it out to customers. Again, early days but it's being very, very well received. Of course, the litmus test is can we do it better than Amazon. Could our Infrastructure as a -- big question. Can Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service differentiate itself from Amazon?

So our cancellation rates were down in the quarter. So we have a very strong renewal rate in our software business. Now that said, we are actually, in many cases, trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means for us more money. That means for us more margin. So it is clearly our objective over time, let's take the applications business, to migrate our on-prem applications customers to our cloud applications and as Larry mentioned, our database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform. And we believe, as you all very well -- most of you at least very well know the math, that means for us a larger recurring revenue stream. And as our margins continue to climb, that means more earnings for us and we think a great experience for our customers as well. Hardware, really more of what we've talked about. Sort of the reason we haven't talked about it much, we had a very good Engineered Systems quarter again. Engineered Systems grew in both bookings and revenue in the quarter. That ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us, does a great job for us. We had declines in what you would think of as our traditional server business. And those declines offset the growth in Engineered Systems. So it's really the tail of sort of 2 product lines, Engineered Systems growing, the traditional server product line declining. Now this is the last quarter, this being Q2, that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we bought a couple of -- MICROS, for example, a couple of years ago, 1.5 years ago. It had a bunch of third-party products that we actually stopped, and that's actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line. That begins to end as we go into Q3. So those are sort of the 3 factors, the third-party products in our MICROS business, growth in Engineered Systems and decline in the traditional services."

Now ultimately, at one point, you'll see the same happening in database, but the reality is you're not seeing it in database at this time because our installed base of usage continues to increase at all levels, on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously."

So let me be clear. So if you convert, if you move from the Oracle E-Business Suite on-premise and then you take up Fusion ERP in the cloud, and we encourage you to do that, right, we want you to do that, you cancel your support for the Oracle ERP on-premise or what we call the E-Business Suite, and you start paying us a monthly fee for Fusion. Okay. So even support, not only does new license go down, but even support goes down because you make the shift. And we want you to do that because we make a lot more money that way. However, in database, if you bring database to Infrastructure as a Service, you need to own the database license. You never cancel your database license and support. That goes on forever. So as people migrate, let's say, you take the Oracle Database to Oracle Infrastructure as a Service, you still pay your support. And if you need more, you buy more -- license more database. Let's say you take the Oracle Database to Amazon. Well, you need your Oracle Database, and you need to -- you need more of it. You got to buy more of it and license more of it, and you have to keep paying support. So they're very different businesses. They've got to be -- they're profiled very, very differently. So as Safra said, a lot of license decline is attributable to our applications business, which is getting -- of which the on-prem application business is getting smaller and smaller. The database business, license business is growing. So these are very -- these will react -- both these businesses will react very differently in the cloud, very -- it's not an unlikely outcome that our database license business goes on forever, and the associated support goes on forever even though customers are running that, that database now not on their own computers but on our Infrastructure as a Service or Amazon's Infrastructure as a Service or Azure's Infrastructure as a Service. So you have to model these 2 businesses entirely differently."

So I only say that to you because all of this is planful on our part. Our objective is to move to SaaS, to get as clear about our direction of SaaS, and it's resulted in this leadership position enterprise SaaS that we discussed earlier. So this is all very planful on our part. To your question about the regions, all of our regions -- the region that had the toughest time in the quarter was Latin America. And Latin America is -- has been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of our team, et cetera, but they're going through all of the things that you all know about. In Brazil, some of the issues that have cropped up now in Mexico. But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of a tough time, they are gaining significant market share in that market. So I -- while the numbers in Latin America are more perhaps not as good as we all would love or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers is fantastic. So I'm actually very proud of them in spite of the fact that the absolute dollar value that say -- save that, our Europe and North America regions performed roughly as I would have expected. I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years. They -- in addition, they've done a tremendous move over to cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis, just taking license and cloud combined, grew, so very significant. I'm pleased with North America as well. I mean, they were roughly as we expected. On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turnaround. It wasn't a couple years ago, we'd sit on a call and get questions about some of the performance in Asia. We weren't very happy with that. We made some changes, and I think the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see. I'm talking about hardware, SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure and license has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia, double-digit."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. I'll then review guidance for Q3 as well as give some direction on FY '17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.Clearly, we are plea",1516,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. I'll then review guidance for Q3 as well as give some direction on FY '17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year when the transition would be largely complete.
While the investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud had limited our ability to expand earnings per share near term, they've been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results in EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in a currency headwind of 1% of total revenue, 2% in some revenue categories and $0.01 to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second $0.01. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $912 million, up 89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail as usual.
When you add together Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software license revenue, they grew 5% in constant currency. And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue together also grew. These are significant milestones in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses, added together, are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4. And from there, we'll be targeting 80%.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now that's lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments to scale out this business.
Now I want to spend a moment explaining it to you because you're going to see some effects. What's happening with the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin except that it's off a much smaller revenue base, and thus, the margin impact is more at the beginning.
To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS, PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale-out, the gross margin declined 15 percentage points before bottoming at 40%. It's now up to 61% and as I just mentioned, will climb to 80% over time.
Similarly, I expect the Infrastructure as a Service gross margin will decline further over the next few quarters as we make investments in the business that hit our expenses immediately, while the revenue is recognized over time. But for modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin, probably doesn't need to go quite that low, but just for modeling purposes, you can aim there. After which, I expect the gross margins will climb to minimally 40% as the business scales, probably higher.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our installed base of customers continues to grow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion. Now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system products' revenue of $497 million and hardware support revenue of $517 million. We are proactive in -- just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue declines and the new availability of IaaS for those customers.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year, and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, considerably higher than last year's 20.4%, which had been favorably impacted by some onetime benefits.
Now in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effect -- favorable impacts to our tax rate over time is higher but obviously not certain.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was USD 0.61. The GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. The GAAP EPS was USD 0.48. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditure for Q2 were $757 million with cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total, with the rest being real estate.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $58 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency.
This quarter, we purchased nearly 13 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarters due obviously to the use of our cash for the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year. Given recent currency movements, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds. Today again was a very significant day in currency with the dollar strengthening.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right now we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 82% to 86%; Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 4% to 6%; Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%; EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%, which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year.
As a reminder, last year's tax rate was lower mostly due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year FY '17, I'm raising the outlook for FY '17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80% with NetSuite now added and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion with over half of it being due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that will not be repeating next year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry -- to Mark for his comments."

As usual, I'm just going to give you a slew of numbers here and try to give you some context on our quarter. Everything's year-on-year in CD unless I say otherwise. Cloud bookings for the quarter, USD 377 million. Now Q2 was the best non-Q4 we have ever had, and I'll make a prediction that Q3 has a chance to be our best ever quarter, period.
SaaS bookings were USD 217 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 160 million. Now just let me give you some numbers by pillar as it relates to our SaaS, PaaS revenue. We were up 89%, more than 30% higher than Amazon, Salesforce or Workday. ERP had 104% growth quarter-on-quarter, eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth greater than 50%. HCM grew 131% again this quarter. That's 4x the growth rate of Workday. CX, Customer Experience, grew 15% organically. Service was up 24%; Data as a Service, up 71%; Database as a Service, up 700% and already at $100 million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600%, and overall SaaS, PaaS grew 89%. SaaS, PaaS billings grew 39% in USD; SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue, 51% in USD.
Now just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimates, and Oracle is now the #1 market share leader in enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers, 1,082 to be exact and had 810 expansions. In CX, we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM, we had 224 new customers and 212 expansions. In ERP, we had 532 new customers, and that does not include NetSuite. We got 91 expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought this quarter.
Our active base now, 3,269 customers with 1,275 live, over 10x greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost 13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite. Fusion Cloud is now nearly 2/3 of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us because it was 10 years actually writing this code and is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go-lives, best quarter ever. 2,116 customers are now live on Fusion.
We got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter, and our installed base now sits at 12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers. They are buying stand-alone infrastructure services, and together, our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now as a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that's used.
Now let me just give you names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just a couple of pillars. First in ERP. So I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter: Canon, Deutsche Telekom, Dick's Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Hill-Rom, Koch Industries, Noble Energy, RIICO [ph] , Skanska, Texas Instruments.
I'm going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter: Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Netgear, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, the Hearst Corporation. It was a solid quarter for us.
And lastly, let me just sort of describe where I think we are. We not only had strong revenue and billings as well, but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%. Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2 revenue was fantastic at 89%, and we've clearly caught -- crossed the revenue chasm. We are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Historically, I've measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our 2 primary competitors: SAP in applications and IBM in infrastructure and database.
That changed as we moved to the cloud. In the cloud, we measure Oracle against Salesforce.com in applications and Amazon Web Services in infrastructure and database. Our cloud application's goal is to be the world's largest and most profitable SaaS company. We are growing our cloud business much faster than Salesforce.com, and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark. But it's going to be close.
IDC already recognizes Oracle as the #1 in annual SaaS sales to large enterprises. Salesforce.com is #2. We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than Salesforce.com. We are catching up to them, and we're catching them very quickly.
Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be #1 running database workloads in the cloud on our Infrastructure as a Service. The Oracle Database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web Services databases, Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Service runs the Oracle Database workloads much faster, more reliably and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle Database running at Amazon's IaaS.
We are making a multi-year generational shift to the cloud, and we're well on our way to being #1 in both cloud applications and cloud database. And we're doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash flow.
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

And it's great when customers are happier. Our next target is really to focus around their overall experience in the cloud after the purchase. So ABE or Accelerated Buying Experience really focused on the actual purchase and the contract. Our focus now is really after that contract and between the contract signing and the renewal. And to that end, on December 1, I announced a group inside Oracle called the Oracle cloud global service and support group. And it really pulls together all the various organizations around the company that had touched our cloud customers and brings them together into an organizational unit, focused solely on pleasing and delighting our customers and giving them the absolute best customer experience they can possibly have.

If you want to move existing database workloads to the cloud and minimize the changes customers have to make as they migrate, in other words, make it a graceful, easy lift and shift, we can configure our cloud network to match their network. We can configure other servers to match their -- the capacity of their servers, configure storage, get -- deliver Exadata service, do all of that with virtually no disruption to what they're doing. They press a button, move their database, move their workloads, and it just runs pretty much like the way it ran. They don't have to retest the application. They just move it, and it will just run. Then, we absolutely need an Infrastructure as a Service in combination with our Platform as a Service. We need both of them to do that gracefully. So it isn't essential. We've been -- and this infrastructure as a business technology development phase for a long time, we're rolling it out to customers. Again, early days but it's being very, very well received. Of course, the litmus test is can we do it better than Amazon. Could our Infrastructure as a -- big question. Can Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service differentiate itself from Amazon? Can we do it more gracefully, more reliably, less expensively, more securely than Amazon can? And we think we can, and that's going to make us very, very competitive."

However, ultimately, we would be -- it would be -- I know it's hard to imagine a good outcome, but it will mean that we are getting an extremely large number in our SaaS, PaaS number, one that's actually is dwarfing not only new software license but new software license and any kind of decline in the software support number such that the whole software number, which is SaaS, PaaS, new software license and support is all going up and actually accelerating."

I think before I go to the hardware thing, the -- our renewal rates in software for the quarter, we usually just tell you they're about the same. To be very exact, they actually went up. So our cancellation rates were down in the quarter. So we have a very strong renewal rate in our software business. Now that said, we are actually, in many cases, trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means for us more money. That means for us more margin. So it is clearly our objective over time, let's take the applications business, to migrate our on-prem applications customers to our cloud applications and as Larry mentioned, our database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform. And we believe, as you all very well -- most of you at least very well know the math, that means for us a larger recurring revenue stream. And as our margins continue to climb, that means more earnings for us and we think a great experience for our customers as well. Hardware, really more of what we've talked about. Sort of the reason we haven't talked about it much, we had a very good Engineered Systems quarter again. Engineered Systems grew in both bookings and revenue in the quarter. That ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us, does a great job for us. We had declines in what you would think of as our traditional server business. And those declines offset the growth in Engineered Systems. So it's really the tale of sort of 2 product lines, Engineered Systems growing, the traditional server product line declining. Now this is the last quarter, this being Q2, that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we bought a couple of -- MICROS, for example, a couple of years ago, 1.5 years ago. It had a bunch of third-party products that we actually stopped, and that's actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line. That begins to end as we go into Q3. So those are sort of the 3 factors, the third-party products in our MICROS business, growth in Engineered Systems and decline in the traditional services."

And as apps has gotten smaller, the base itself is not -- is small, but when it declines, it has a smaller impact on our overall new software license. Now ultimately, at one point, you'll see the same happening in database, but the reality is you're not seeing it in database at this time because our installed base of usage continues to increase at all levels, on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously."

So let me be clear. So if you convert, if you move from the Oracle E-Business Suite on-premise and then you take up Fusion ERP in the cloud, and we encourage you to do that, right, we want you to do that, you cancel your support for the Oracle ERP on-premise or what we call the E-Business Suite, and you start paying us a monthly fee for Fusion. Okay. So even support, not only does new license go down, but even support goes down because you make the shift. And we want you to do that because we make a lot more money that way. However, in database, if you bring database to Infrastructure as a Service, you need to own the database license. You never cancel your database license and support. That goes on forever. So as people migrate, let's say, you take the Oracle Database to Oracle Infrastructure as a Service, you still pay your support. And if you need more, you buy more -- license more database. Let's say you take the Oracle Database to Amazon. Well, you need your Oracle Database, and you need to -- you need more of it. You got to buy more of it and license more of it, and you have to keep paying support. So they're very different businesses. They've got to be -- they're profiled very, very differently. So as Safra said, a lot of license decline is attributable to our applications business, which is getting -- of which the on-prem application business is getting smaller and smaller. The database business, license business is growing. So these are very -- these will react -- both these businesses will react very differently in the cloud, very -- it's not an unlikely outcome that our database license business goes on forever, and the associated support goes on forever even though customers are running that, that database now not on their own computers but on our Infrastructure as a Service or Amazon's Infrastructure as a Service or Azure's Infrastructure as a Service. So you have to model these 2 businesses entirely differently."

By the way, just to be clear to the CTO's earlier point, as it relates to apps and applications business, we actually don't compensate our salespeople for applications on-premise. So just to be clear, to connect these dots in terms of how we actually operationalize the company, our salespeople in the applications ecosystem sell SaaS. So if they sell -- we have small SWAT teams in our, what we would call, our Oracle Direct organization that really help our existing users buy incremental seats if they need to, to their existing on-premise applications. So I only say that to you because all of this is planful on our part. Our objective is to move to SaaS, to get as clear about our direction of SaaS, and it's resulted in this leadership position enterprise SaaS that we discussed earlier. So this is all very planful on our part. To your question about the regions, all of our regions -- the region that had the toughest time in the quarter was Latin America. And Latin America is -- has been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of our team, et cetera, but they're going through all of the things that you all know about. In Brazil, some of the issues that have cropped up now in Mexico. But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of a tough time, they are gaining significant market share in that market. So I -- while the numbers in Latin America are more perhaps not as good as we all would love or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers is fantastic. So I'm actually very proud of them in spite of the fact that the absolute dollar value that say -- save that, our Europe and North America regions performed roughly as I would have expected. I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years. They -- in addition, they've done a tremendous move over to cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis, just taking license and cloud combined, grew, so very significant. I'm pleased with North America as well. I mean, they were roughly as we expected. On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turnaround. It wasn't a couple years ago, we'd sit on a call and get questions about some of the performance in Asia. We weren't very happy with that. We made some changes, and I think the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see. I'm talking about hardware, SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure and license has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia, double-digit."
