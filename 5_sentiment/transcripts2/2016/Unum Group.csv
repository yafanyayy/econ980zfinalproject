Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2015 on a strong note with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, bringing the full year EPS to $3.64.  Whi",604,"Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2015 on a strong note with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, bringing the full year EPS to $3.64.  Which is an increase of 3.7%. We ended the year in the middle of outlook range of 2% to 5%, which we're tracking to all year. I'm specially pleased with the balance performance we continue to show on our core business segments. With good levels of premium growth, complimented by stable benefits expense across all lines. This combination helps to drive a strong profit margin and excellent capital generation for the company.
Our financial flexibility continues to be an important asset to us as we move into 2016, as we look to take advantage of the opportunities for profitable growth and to expand our leadership positions in the employee and voluntary benefits market.
I will cover a few highlights for the fourth quarter and then Jack will provide analysis of our results in greater detail. I will start with premium growth in our core business segments, which continue at a healthy and well-balanced pace. For the fourth quarter, premiums in each of our 3 core segments, Unum US., Unum UK and Colonial Life all increased by more than 5%. For Unum US, fourth quarter sales had a difficult conversion given the 25% in the year ago fourth quarter, but for the full year, 2015, we generated, an increase of just over 4%, at the top end of coming in 2015.
In addition, Unum US persistency trends remain favorable and our ongoing focus on renewals helped drive the 5.5% increase in premium income. Unum UK sales in local currency improved in the fourth quarter with growth of 11%, driven largely by strong results in the core market long-term disability sales and large case Group Life sales. Combined with improving persistency and the benefit of a recently acquired a dental business, Unum UK generated 5% growth in premiums in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, at Colonial Life, sales growth continues to be quite encouraging. Increasing 5% for the fourth quarter and almost 7% for the full year, helping to generate premium growth of just over 5% for the quarter.
Next, it's important that we've not sacrifice the profitable the of our core businesses to generate this premier growth as our benefits expense to remain stable and was all 3 business segments. In fact, the benefit ratios for the 3 core business segments improved for the full year, 2015, relative to 2014.
Jack will provide additional detail on these trends in his commentary. Given these operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. This flexibility allows us to fund the capital required to grow our business, but also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as we brought back for $27 million of stock in 2015. In addition, we've continue to grow our book value per share with book value now at $35.90, an increase of 8.4% for the year, consistent with the growth we've generated since 2008. 
And finally, the macro environment, including the ongoing low interest rate environment continues to present challenges. Interest rates and investments spreads remain below historical levels and below our portfolio yields. Our focus remains on actively managing through this environment by steadily taking pricing actions, near-term it does continue to dampen our profit growth.
So with these highlights on our fourth quarter performance, I'll have Jack cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level view of our fourth quarter results, and now I want provide a more in-depth review of the operating and business trends we saw in the quarter. I will begin with Unum US, where fourth quarter operating income was $214.2 million, an increase of 2.2% on the year-ago quarter of $209.5 million. Premium income growth remains very healthy increasing 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while the benefit ratio for Unum US segment improves slightly to 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the year-ago quarter.
The profitability of Unum US remained strong with an operating ROE of 13.1% for the fourth quarter, and 13.3% for the full year. Within the Unum US segment operating income in our core -- in our group disability business was $66.1 million, an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter of $65.9 million. Premium income increased 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 5.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by lower asset levels, lower portfolio yield and lower miscellaneous investment income.
Benefits experienced improved in the fourth quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 81.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 83.7% a year ago, driven primarily by lower claims incidence rates and favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line as well as favorable benefits experienced in our group short-term disability line.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $54.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow at a favorable levels, increasing 5.2% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 72% for the fourth quarter compared to 70.8% in the year-ago quarter due to a higher average paid claim size, for both the Group Life line and the AD&D line of business. While the benefit ratio was higher on a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter experience was generally consistent with the 71.8% benefit ratio for the full year, 2015.
Operating income and supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $93.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11.3% compared to $84.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong for this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
From the benefits perspective, results were a line with our expectation. The fourth quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 33.8% on an interest adjusted basis and 48% for the voluntary benefits line.
With Unum UK, operating income was a GBP 24.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% over the year-ago quarter of GBP 24.1 million. The benefit ratio was 69.9% for the fourth quarter, compared to 68.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher claims incidence trends in the group long-term disability including Group Life business, which are partially offset by group claim recoveries. Overall, profitability of the U.K. segment remains quite favorable, with an operating ROE of 20.6% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.
Colonial Life continues to generate strong consistent result with operating income of $77.6 million, up 4.9% increase over the year-ago quarter of $74 million. The benefit ratio improved to 51.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 52.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experienced in the sickness and disability product line. Margin remain strong for Colonial Life with operating ROE of 16.4% this quarter and 16.6% for the full year.
Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the 2014 long-term care reserve charge. The benefits experienced by the individual disability line was in line with our expectation. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 87.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 81% in the year-ago quarter, was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on the future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of miscellaneous net investment income. 
For the long-term line, the interest-adjusted the loss ratio was 89.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 89.6% for the year-ago quarter excluding the reserve charge.
The underlying risk experienced for long-term care was consistent with our long-term expectation for the full year, 2015, interest-adjusted loss ratio of 87.6% within our expected range of 85% to 90%. 
Regarding the reserve position for long-term care, we feel good about where we finished 2015 in terms of reserve adequacy. For the year, our new money yield exceeded our interest rate assumptions and risk reserves remained within our long-term expectations. In addition, rate increase approvals and implementation are tracking in line with our reserve assumptions. One additional comment on long-term care, the cash flow testing reserve addition were recorded for our new subsidiary First Unum was $68 million at year-end 2015. I will now move to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter.
Again, starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 3.7% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected as we had very strong sales results from the year-ago fourth quarter, and we continue to increase rates during the year. For the full year, Unum US sales increased by 4.2%, which was slightly above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth. 
Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the fourth quarter, but increased 7.2% for the full year. STD sales declined by 20% for the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for the full year, increasing by 0.8%. At Group Life and AD&D, sales declined 2.5% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year, also within Unum US, we had strong sales results in individual disability for the fourth quarter, increasing 30.4% to $21 million, driven by success with large case enrollments. 
Full year sales growth for the individual disability line was 18.8%. Finally, in the voluntary benefits, total sales declined 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core market voluntary benefits sales showed very good growth while sales were lower against a very strong quarter last year.
Full year 2015 sales and voluntary benefits increased 10.3% with good balance between the core market and large case sales. Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US calls for growth rate in the 2% to 4% again. It's slightly that we will quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility of timing of large case sales.
Persistency for Unum US continues at healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was 90.3% for the full year, 2015, which was stable with the 90.5% for 2014. Given these sales trends and persistency levels, along with the underlying management of enforcement we generated premium income growth for Unum US this quarter of 5.5%. Full year premium growth was 6.4%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this segment and our strongest rate of growth in many years.
Sales in Unum UK rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, increasing 11.2% in local currency with the favorable trends in the core market group long-term group disability market line and Group Life. For the full year, sales grew by 6.2%. Persistency in the group disability line was 89.2% for the full year of 2015, off slightly from 2014 levels, but in line with our expectations.
Persistency for the Group Life line continue to recover at 80% for full year 2015, up from 76% in 2014. Premium income growth for the U.K. of this quarter was 5.4% in local currency, including the impact of the acquisition of the dental business in the third quarter, and 2.3% for full year above our expectations of 0% to 2% growth.
Finally, Colonial Life lives elsewhere remain on a positive trend, increasing 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for the full year. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial market sector, both core markets sales and large case sales in the public sector. In addition, each product lines showed positive year-over-year growth. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower for the year at 78.5% compared to 79.4% for 2014, but premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Full year premium growth was also 5.1% well above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments as well as the profit margins we're maintaining.
Looking our investment results. New money yields were slightly better in the fourth quarter compared to the first 9 months of 2015. However, today's new money yields remain below our current portfolio yield, so the downward pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability. We are actively raising prices in our markets to help manage this impact. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. Our overall default experience relative to the index was again very favorable at 15 basis points for full year 2015, compared to 80 basis points for the index. 
I'd like to give you an update on our energy-related holdings, which totaled $5 billion for 11.6% of our total fixed maturity securities at year-end 2015.
The severe widening of credit spreads in the energy segment's sector during the fourth quarter, reduced the net unrealized gain from $302.8 million as of September 30, 2015, to a net unrealized loss of $51.4 million at December 31, 2015.
We saw relatively more spread widening in the oilfield services and independent oil and gas sectors of our portfolio, as we discussed at our outlook in December, these sectors tend to be the most sensitive companies to oil prices. The sectors represent 4% and 29.8% of our energy holdings, respectively, and had a net unrealized loss of $114.9 million as of year-end.
The remaining 2/3 of our energy holdings are in midstream companies, integrated oil companies and the refiners. These holdings are much less sensitive to oil prices, and have a net unrealized gain of $63.5 million at year-end. Our exposure to below investment grade energy credits declined slightly in the quarter to 14 .1% of the energy holdings, compared to 14.8% at the end of the third quarter.
Approximately 3/4 of the below investment grade exposure is the more highly rated BB category. Realized losses in energy holdings from both losses on sales and from impairments were $20.1 million for the fourth quarter.
energy holdings and look at a number stressed scenarios. While downgrade of holdings and some impairments may have over time, we feel the impacts are very manageable and did not alter our financial per capital plans. 
Moving to capital management. We continue to see very favorable trends. We repurchased the $100 million of stock this quarter, bringing the total repurchases to $427 million in full year 2015, which is a approximately 4.9% of our year ends 2014 outstanding shares. We estimate, we close the year with a weighted average risk base capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies at approximately 400%, consistent with the levels we held throughout the year, and towards the higher end of our expected range for the year. Holding company cash and marketable securities was $475 million at year end, and statutory operating and comes were $182.4 million for the fourth quarter and $689.2 million for full year 2015, a strong sales level of earnings and 11.5% increase over 2014.
Finally, I'll note that our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.5% was favorable relative to the 30.9% rate that we recorded for the first three quarters in the year. This was primarily driven by reduction in deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations as a result of the enactment of future reductions in the U.K. tax rates, and also the benefit of the extension of active financing in the fourth quarter that reversed the tax expense we recorded in the third quarter.
Wrapping up, our expectation for after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is not changed from what we previously discussed at our outlook meeting at December. We did finish 2015 with a higher level of income than we had anticipated, so the growth rate for 2016 of the $3.64 of 2015 operating income per share, is expected to be within a range of 3% to 6%. So, overall, it was a very good fourth quarter and a very strong full year performance for the company. Now, I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

We try not to focus on that from a operator perspective. What it does actually meet up with how we think about managing the capital of the company is, we are buying back our shares and have been doing so for the last several years. So when you look at that, you think about, where we are buying back shares today relative to where we were even in the fourth quarter and over the average of the year, and how does that impact our thinking. And when I this gets to your philosophical point is, we actually on that front, stay very consistent as well. So we think about ourselves as a steady returner of capital to our shareholders. We will buy a little bit more when prices are down and a little bit less when the prices are up. But consistency of return is something that we focus on as they general philosophy of the company, but also with regard to the capital management. So as we look at where our share price is today, we will be buying a lot more shares, in terms of the actual dollars that we're putting out, you probably see a pretty consistent levels to what we've done in the past."

How do we reduce the capital buying those lines of business, so we can continue to do what we've been doing in more capital to our operating companies. But also on position that we're generating enough capital as a company that our business lines, our main operating companies are getting the capital -- getting all the capital that they need to continue to generate growth. I think the -- only constrain is more in the market in making sure that it's good profitable growth as opposed to the amount of capital we can put behind it. So as we tell everyone inside the companies, we want to funnel as much capital as we possibly can to continue to grow our lines of business. And what we haven't found, is actually a shortfall to do so. And that's one of the reason we're buying back a lot of stock is because we actually can't put as much capital sa we want to behind our growing lines that are generating very high returns. So back to your original question, I think that the capital allocating to our Closed Block is one we want to reduce over time.

That would be a 15 point impact to our risk-based capital. It's -- capital leading impact on risk-based capital is more than just looking at the change in the RBC factors because C1 capital gets cash affected, and so that reduces the burden. There's also significant diversification benefit with C1 capital that further reduces the impact relative to those numbers. So something that we really need to work through. But it's far less of an impact than just looking at the change in the percent capital holdings applying them by a 3.5."

We finished 2015 on a strong note with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, bringing the full year EPS to $3.64, which is an increase of 3.7%. We ended the year in the middle of our outlook range of 2% to 5%, which we're tracking to all year. I'm especially pleased with the balanced performance we continue to show on our core business segments. With good levels of premium growth, complemented by stable benefits experienced across all lines, this combination helps to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company.
Our financial flexibility continues to be an important asset to us as we move into 2016, as we look to take advantage of the opportunities for profitable growth and to expand our leadership positions in the employee and voluntary benefits markets.
I will cover a few highlights for the fourth quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. I'll start with premium growth in our core business segments, which continue at a healthy and well-balanced pace. For the fourth quarter, premiums in each of our 3 core segments, Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, all increased by more than 5%. For Unum US, fourth quarter sales had a difficult comparison given the 25% jump we saw in the year-ago fourth quarter. But for the full year 2015, we generated an increase of just over 4%, at the top end of our expectations coming into 2015.
In addition, Unum US persistency trends remain favorable, and our ongoing focus on renewals helped drive the 5.5% increase in premium income. Unum UK sales in local currency improved in the fourth quarter with growth of 11%, driven largely by strong results in the core market long-term disability sales and large case Group Life sales. Combined with improving persistency and the benefit of a recently acquired dental business, Unum UK generated 5% growth in premiums in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, at Colonial Life, sales growth continues to be quite encouraging, increasing 5% for the fourth quarter and almost 7% for the full year, helping to generate premium growth of just over 5% for the quarter.
Next, it's important that we've not sacrificed the profitability of our core businesses to generate this premium growth, as our benefits experience has remained stable across all 3 business segments. In fact, the benefit ratios for the 3 core business segments improved for the full year 2015 relative to 2014.
Jack will provide additional detail on these trends in his commentary. Given these operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. This flexibility allows us to fund the capital required to grow our business, while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as we brought back $427 million of stock in 2015. In addition, we've continued to grow our book value per share with book value now at $35.90, an increase of 8.4% for the year, consistent with the growth we have generated since 2008. 
And finally, the macro environment, including the ongoing low interest rate environment, continues to present challenges. Interest rates and investment spreads remain below historical levels and below our portfolio yields. Our focus remains on actively managing through this environment by steadily taking pricing actions. But in the near term, it does continue to dampen our profit growth. 
So with these highlights on our fourth quarter performance, I'll have Jack cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results, and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the operating and business trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum US, where fourth quarter operating income was $214.2 million, an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter of $209.5 million. Premium income growth remains very healthy, increasing 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while the benefit ratio for Unum US segment improves slightly to 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the year-ago quarter.
The profitability of Unum US remained strong with an operating ROE of 13.1% for the fourth quarter, and 13.3% for the full year. Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our core -- in our group disability business was $66.1 million, an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter of $65.9 million. Premium income increased 5.5% over the year-ago quarter. But we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 5.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by lower asset levels, lower portfolio yield and lower miscellaneous investment income.
Benefits experience improved in the fourth quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 81.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 83.7% a year ago, driven primarily by lower claims incidence rates and favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line as well as favorable benefits experienced in our group short-term disability line.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $54.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow at a favorable level, increasing 5.2% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 72% for the fourth quarter compared to 70.8% in the year-ago quarter due to a higher average paid claim size for both the Group Life line and the AD&D line of business. While the benefit ratio was higher on a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter experience was generally consistent with the 71.8% benefit ratio for the full year 2015.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $93.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11.3% compared to $84.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong for this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
From the benefits perspective, results were in line with our expectation. The fourth quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 33.8% on an interest-adjusted basis and 48% for the voluntary benefits line.
Looking at Unum UK, operating income was a GBP 24.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% over the year-ago quarter of GBP 24.1 million. The benefit ratio was 69.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 68.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher claim incidence trends in the group long-term disability and Group Life lines of business, which were approximately offset by improved claim recoveries. Overall, profitability of the UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 20.6% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.
Colonial Life continues to generate strong consistent results with operating income of $77.6 million, up 4.9% increase over the year-ago quarter of $74 million. The benefit ratio improved to 51.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 52.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experienced in the accident, sickness and disability product line. Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 16.4% this quarter and 16.6% for the full year.
Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the 2014 long-term care reserve charge. The benefits experienced for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest-adjusted loss ratio to 87.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 81% in the year-ago quarter was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher-than-normal level of miscellaneous net investment income. 
For the long-term care line, the interest-adjusted loss ratio was 89.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 89.6% for the year-ago quarter, excluding the reserve charge.
The underlying risk experienced for long-term care was consistent with our long-term expectations for the full year 2015 interest-adjusted loss ratio of 87.6%, within our expected range of 85% to 90%. 
Regarding the reserve position for long-term care, we feel good about where we finished 2015 in terms of reserve adequacy. For the year, our new money yields exceeded all and remained within our long-term expectations. In addition, rate increase approvals and implementation are tracking in line with our reserve assumptions. One additional comment on long-term care, the cash flow testing reserve addition we recorded for our New York subsidiary, First Unum, was $68 million at year-end 2015. I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter.
Again, starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 3.7% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected as we had very strong sales results from the year-ago fourth quarter, and we continue to increase rates during the year. For the full year, Unum US sales increased by 4.2%, which was slightly above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth. 
Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the fourth quarter, but increased 7.2% for the full year. STD sales declined by 20% for the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for the full year, increasing by 0.8%. At Group Life and AD&D, sales declined 2.5% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Also within Unum US, we had strong sales results in individual disability for the fourth quarter, increasing 30.4% to $21 million, driven by success with large case enrollment. 
Full-year sales growth for the individual disability line was 18.8%. Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core market voluntary benefit sales showed very good growth, while large case sales were lower against a very strong large case quarter last year.
Full year 2015 sales and voluntary benefits increased 10.3% with good balance between the core market and large case sales. Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US calls for growth rate in the 2% to 4% range again. It's likely that we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility of timing of large case sales.
Persistency for Unum US continues at healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was 90.3% for the full year 2015, which was stable with the 90.5% for 2014. Given these sales trends and persistency levels, along with the underlying management of enforced renewals, we generated premium income growth for Unum US this quarter of 5.5%. Full year premium growth was 6.4%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this segment and our strongest rate of growth in many years.
Sales in Unum UK rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, increasing 11.2% in local currency, with favorable trends in the core market group long-term disability product line and in Group Life. For the full year, sales grew by 6.2%. Persistency in the group disability line was 89.2% for the full year of 2015, off slightly from 2014 levels, but in line with our expectations.
Persistency for the Group Life line continue to recover at 80% for full year 2015, up from 76% in 2014. Premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 5.4% in local currency, including the impact of the acquisition of the dental business in the third quarter, and 2.3% for full year above our expectations of 0% to 2% growth.
Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on a positive trend, increasing 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for the full year. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial market sector, both core market sales and large case sales in the public sector. In addition, each product lines showed positive year-over-year growth. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower for the year at 78.5% compared to 79.4% for 2014. But premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Full year premium growth was also 5.1% well above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments as well as the profit margins we are maintaining.
Looking now at investment results. New, money yields were slightly better in the fourth quarter compared to the first 9 months of 2015. However, today's new money yields remain below our current portfolio yield, so the downward pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability. We're actively raising prices in our markets to help manage this impact. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. Our overall default experience relative to the Moody's index was again very favorable at 15 basis points for full year 2015 compared to 80 basis points for the index. 
I'd like to give you an update on our energy-related holdings, which totaled $5 billion or 11.6% of our total fixed maturity securities at year-end 2015.
The severe widening of credit spreads in the energy sector during the fourth quarter reduced the net unrealized gain from $302.8 million as of September 30, 2015 to a net unrealized loss of $51.4 million at December 31, 2015.
We saw relatively more spread widening in the oilfield services and independent oil and gas sectors of our portfolio. As we discussed with you at our outlook meeting in December, these sectors tend to be the most sensitive companies to oil prices. The sectors represent 4% and 29.8% of our energy holdings, respectively, and had a net unrealized loss of $114.9 million as of year-end.
The remaining 2/3 of our energy holdings are in midstream companies, integrated oil companies and refiners. These holdings are much less sensitive to oil prices and have a net unrealized gain of $63.5 million at year-end. Our exposure to below-investment grade energy credits declined slightly in the quarter to 14.1% of the energy holdings compared to 14.8% at the end of the third quarter.
Approximately 3/4 of the below-investment grade exposure is the more highly rated BB category. Realized losses in energy holdings from both losses on sales and from impairments were $20.1 million pretax for the fourth quarter.
We have thoroughly reviewed our energy holdings and looked at a number of stress scenarios. While downgrade of holdings and some impairments may happen over time, we feel the impacts are very manageable and did not alter our financial per capital plans. 
Moving to capital management. We continue to see very favorable trends. We repurchased the $100 million of our stock this quarter, bringing the total repurchases to $427 million in full year 2015, which is approximately 4.9% of our year-end 2014 outstanding shares. We estimate we close the year with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies at approximately 400%, consistent with the levels we've held throughout the year and towards the higher end of our expected range for the year. Holding company cash and marketable securities was $475 million at year-end, and statutory operating earnings were $182.4 million for the fourth quarter and $689.2 million for full year 2015, a strong sales level of earnings and an 11.5% increase over 2014.
Finally, I'll note our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 28.5% was favorable relative to the 30.9% rate that we recorded for the first three quarters of the year. This was primarily driven by a reduction in deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations as a result of the enactment of future reductions in the U.K. tax rate and also the benefit of the extension of active financing in the fourth quarter that reversed the tax expense we recorded in the third quarter.
Wrapping up, our expectation for after-tax operating income per share for 2016 has not changed from what we've previously discussed at our outlook meeting in December. We did finish 2015 with a higher level of income than we had anticipated. So the growth rate for 2016 of $3.64 of 2015 operating income per share is expected to be within a range of 3% to 6%. So overall, it was a very good fourth quarter and a very strong full year performance for the company. Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

So when you look at that, you think about where we're buying back shares today relative to where we were even in the fourth quarter and for over the average of the year and how does it impact our thinking. And what I take you to, this gets to your philosophical point, is we actually, on that front, stay very consistent as well. So we think about it ourselves as a steady returner of capital to our shareholders. We'll buy a little bit more when prices are down and a little bit less when prices are up. But consistency of return is something that we focus on as a general philosophy of the company, but also with regards to capital management.

And the last one is again maybe more of a philosophical question. As we think about your capital allocation across your businesses, it seems like the portion that's allocated to the Closed Block is, I don't know, almost a little over 1/3 of your capital, maybe 35%, 36%. Is that factored into your thinking? In other words, is there a limit in terms of how much, how big you want that allocation to be? It would seem to me that most of the capital that you're using for share repurchase is coming out of the operating segment. So naturally, there would be some upward drift in that allocation. Just want to get a sense of how, should we be thinking about that number? Is it a binding constraint at all? Any help would be -- any guidance would be helpful."

When we think about the capital allocation to our Closed Block, that's not where we want to be putting our capital today. And so the numbers you see here today are higher than we want them to be. And I think that it gets back to the question that Jack was answering, is how do we free up that capital? How do we reduce the capital buying those lines of business, so that we can continue to do what we've been doing and funneling more capital to our operating companies? We're also in a fortunate position that we're generating enough capital as a company that our business lines, our main operating companies are getting the capital -- getting all the capital that they need to continue to generate growth. I think their constraint, only constraint is more in the market, making sure that it's good profitable growth as opposed to the amount of capital we can put behind it. So as we tell everyone inside the company is we want to funnel as much capital as we possibly can to continue to grow our lines of business. And what we haven't found is actually a shortfall to do so. And that's one of the reasons we're buying back a lot of stock, is because we actually can't put as much capital as we want to behind our growing lines that are generating very high returns. So back to your original question, I think that the capital we're allocating to our Closed Block is one that we want to reduce over time. And as we've talked about in different settings, that's something we're actively working on as a company."

The second kind of point I'd give you, if everything dropped a full letter, so all our BBBs went to BBs, all of our As went to triple BBB, that would be a 15-point impact to our risk-based capital. It's -- calculating the impact on risk-based capital is more than just looking at the change in the RBC factors because C1 capital gets cash-affected. And so that reduces the burden. There's also a significant diversification benefit with C1 capital that further reduces the impact relative to those numbers. So it's something that we really need to work through, but it's far less of an impact than just looking at the change in the percent capital holdings multiplying them by 3.5."

Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2015 on a strong note with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, bringing the full year EPS to $3.64, whic",610,"Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2015 on a strong note with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, bringing the full year EPS to $3.64, which is an increase of 3.7%. We ended the year in the middle of our outlook range of 2% to 5%, which we were tracking to all year. I'm especially pleased with the balanced performance we continue to show on our core business segments. With good levels of premium growth, complemented by stable benefits experience across all lines, this combination helps to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company.
Our financial flexibility continues to be an important asset to us as we move into 2016, as we look to take advantage of the opportunities for profitable growth and to expand our leadership positions in the employee and voluntary benefits markets.
I will cover a few highlights for the fourth quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. I'll start with premium growth in our core business segments, which continues at a healthy and well-balanced pace. For the fourth quarter, premiums in each of our 3 core segments, Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, all increased by more than 5%. For Unum US, fourth quarter sales had a difficult comparison given the 25% jump we saw in the year-ago fourth quarter. But for the full year 2015, we generated an increase of just over 4%, at the top end of our expectations coming into 2015.
In addition, Unum US persistency trends remain favorable, and our ongoing focus on renewals helped drive the 5.5% increase in premium income. 
Unum UK sales in local currency improved in the fourth quarter with growth of 11%, driven largely by strong results in the core market long-term disability sales and large case Group Life sales. Combined with improving persistency and the benefit of a recently acquired dental business, Unum UK generated 5% growth in premiums in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, at Colonial Life, sales growth continues to be quite encouraging, increasing 5% for the fourth quarter and almost 7% for the full year, helping to generate premium growth of just over 5% for the quarter.
Next, it's important that we've not sacrificed the profitability of our core businesses to generate this premium growth, as our benefits experience has remained stable across all 3 business segments. In fact, the benefit ratios for the 3 core business segments improved for the full year 2015 relative to 2014.
Jack will provide additional detail on these trends in his commentary. Given these operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. This flexibility allows us to fund the capital required to grow our business, while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as we bought back $427 million of stock in 2015. In addition, we've continued to grow our book value per share with book value now at $35.90, an increase of 8.4% for the year, consistent with the growth we have generated since 2008. 
And finally, the macro environment, including the ongoing low interest rate environment, continues to present challenges. Interest rates and investment spreads remain below historical levels and below our portfolio yields. Our focus remains on actively managing through this environment by steadily taking pricing actions. But in the near term, it does continue to dampen our profit growth. 
So with these highlights on our fourth quarter performance, I'll have Jack cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results, and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the operating and business trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum US, where fourth quarter operating income was $214.2 million, an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter of $209.5 million. Premium income growth remains very healthy, increasing 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while the benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved slightly to 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the year-ago quarter.
The profitability of Unum US remained strong with an operating ROE of 13.1% for the fourth quarter, and 13.3% for the full year. Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our core -- in our group disability business was $66.1 million, an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter of $65.9 million. Premium income increased 5.5% over the year-ago quarter. But we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 5.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by lower asset levels, lower portfolio yields and lower miscellaneous investment income.
Benefits experience improved in the fourth quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 81.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 83.7% a year ago, driven primarily by lower claims incidence rates and favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line as well as favorable benefits experienced in our group short-term disability line.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $54.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow at a favorable level, increasing 5.2% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 72% for the fourth quarter compared to 70.8% in the year-ago quarter due to a higher average paid claim size for both the Group Life line and the AD&D line of business. While the benefit ratio was higher on a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter experience was generally consistent with the 71.8% benefit ratio for the full year 2015.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $93.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11.3% compared to $84.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong for this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
From the benefits perspective, results were in line with our expectation. The fourth quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 33.8% on an interest-adjusted basis and 48% for the voluntary benefits lines.
Looking at Unum UK, operating income was a GBP 24.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% over the year-ago quarter of GBP 24.1 million. The benefit ratio was 69.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 68.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher claim incidence trends in the group long-term disability and Group Life lines of business, which were partially offset by improved claim recoveries. Overall, profitability of the UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 20.6% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.
Colonial Life continues to generate strong, consistent results with operating income of $77.6 million, a 4.9% increase over the year-ago quarter of $74 million. The benefit ratio improved to 51.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 52.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the accident, sickness and disability product line. Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 16.4% this quarter and 16.6% for the full year.
Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the 2014 long-term care reserve charge. The benefits experienced for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest-adjusted loss ratio to 87.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 81% in the year-ago quarter was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher-than-normal level of miscellaneous net investment income. 
For the long-term care line, the interest-adjusted loss ratio was 89.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 89.6% for the year-ago quarter, excluding the reserve charge.
The underlying risk experience for long-term care was consistent with our long-term expectations for the full year 2015 interest-adjusted loss ratio of 87.6%, within our expected range of 85% to 90%. 
Regarding the reserve position for long-term care, we feel good about where we finished 2015 in terms of reserve adequacy. For the year, our new money yields exceeded our interest rate assumptions and risk results remained within our long term expectations. In addition, rate increase approvals and implementation are tracking in line with our reserve assumptions. One additional comment on long-term care, the cash flow testing reserve addition we recorded for our New York subsidiary, First Unum, was $68 million at year-end 2015. 
I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter.
Again, starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 3.7% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected as we had very strong sales results from the year-ago fourth quarter, and we continued to increase rates during the year. For the full year, Unum US sales increased by 4.2%, which was slightly above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth. 
Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the fourth quarter, but increased 7.2% for the full year. STD sales declined by 20% for the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for the full year, increasing by 0.8%. Our Group Life and AD&D, sales declined 2.5% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Also within Unum US, we had strong sales results in individual disability for the fourth quarter, increasing 30.4% to $21 million, driven by success with large case enrollments. 
Full-year sales growth for the individual disability line was 18.8%. Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core market voluntary benefit sales showed very good growth, while large case sales were lower against a very strong large case quarter last year.
Full year 2015 sales and voluntary benefits increased 10.3% with good balance between the core market and large case sales. Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US calls for growth rate in the 2% to 4% range again. It's likely that we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility of timing of large case sales.
Persistency for Unum US continues at healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was 90.3% for the full year 2015, which was stable with the 90.5% for 2014. Given these sales trends and persistency levels, along with the underlying management of inforce renewals, we generated premium income growth for Unum US this quarter of 5.5%. Full year premium growth was 6.4%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this segment and our strongest rate of growth in many years.
Sales in Unum UK rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, increasing 11.2% in local currency, with favorable trends in the core market group long-term disability product line and in Group Life. For the full year, sales grew by 6.2%. Persistency in the group disability line was 89.2% for the full year of 2015, off slightly from 2014 levels, but in line with our expectations.
Persistency for the Group Life line continue to recover at 80% for full year 2015, up from 76% in 2014. Premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 5.4% in local currency, including the impact of the acquisition of the dental business in the third quarter, and 2.3% for full year above our expectations of 0% to 2% growth.
Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on a positive trend, increasing 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for the full year. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial market sector, both core market sales and large case sales in the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower for the year at 78.5% compared to 79.4% for 2014. But premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Full year premium growth was also 5.1% well above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments as well as the profit margins we are maintaining.
Looking now at investment results. New money yields were slightly better in the fourth quarter compared to the first 9 months of 2015. However, today's new money yields remain below our current portfolio yields, so the downward pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability. We're actively raising prices in our markets to help manage this impact. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. Our overall default experience relative to the Moody's index was again very favorable at 15 basis points for full year 2015 compared to 80 basis points for the index. 
I'd like to give you an update on our energy-related holdings, which totaled $5 billion or 11.6% of our total fixed maturity securities at year-end 2015.
The severe widening of credit spreads in the energy sector during the fourth quarter reduced the net unrealized gain from $302.8 million as of September 30, 2015 to a net unrealized loss of $51.4 million at December 31, 2015.
We saw relatively more spread widening in the oilfield services and independent oil and gas sectors of our portfolio. As we discussed with you at our outlook meeting in December, these sectors tend to be the most sensitive companies to oil prices. The sectors represent 4% and 29.8% of our energy holdings, respectively, and had a net unrealized loss of $114.9 million as of year-end.
The remaining 2/3 of our energy holdings are in midstream companies, integrated oil companies and refiners. These holdings are much less sensitive to oil prices and have a net unrealized gain of $63.5 million at year-end. Our exposure to below-investment grade energy credits declined slightly in the quarter to 14.1% of the energy holdings compared to 14.8% at the end of the third quarter.
Approximately 3/4 of the below-investment grade exposure is the more highly rated BB category. Realized losses in energy holdings from both losses on sales and from impairments were $20.1 million pretax for the fourth quarter.
We have thoroughly reviewed our energy holdings and looked at a number of stress scenarios. While downgrade of holdings and some impairments may happen over time, we feel the impacts are very manageable and did not alter our financial or capital plans. 
Moving to capital management. We continue to see very favorable trends. We repurchased $100 million of our stock this quarter, bringing the total repurchases to $427 million in full year 2015, which is approximately 4.9% of our year-end 2014 outstanding shares. We estimate we closed the year with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies at approximately 400%, consistent with the levels we've held throughout the year and towards the higher end of our expected range for the year. Holding company cash and marketable securities was $475 million at year-end, and statutory operating earnings were $182.4 million for the fourth quarter and $689.2 million for full year 2015, a strong sales level of earnings and an 11.5% increase over 2014.
Finally, I'll note our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 28.5% was favorable relative to the 30.9% rate that we recorded for the first 3 quarters of the year. This was primarily driven by a reduction in our deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations as a result of the enactment of future reductions in the U.K. tax rate and also the benefit of the extension of active financing in the fourth quarter that reversed the tax expense we recorded in the third quarter.
Wrapping up, our expectation for after-tax operating income per share for 2016 has not changed from what we previously discussed at our outlook meeting in December. We did finish 2015 with a higher level of income than we had anticipated. So the growth rate for 2016 off of the $3.64 of 2015 operating income per share is expected to be within a range of 3% to 6%. So overall, it was a very good fourth quarter and a very strong full year performance for the company. Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

Where it does actually meet up with how we think about managing the capital of the company is we are buying back our shares and have been doing so for the last several years. So when you look at that, you think about where we're buying back shares today relative to where we were even in the fourth quarter and for over the average of the year and how does it impact our thinking.

So we think about it ourselves as a steady returner of capital to our shareholders. We'll buy a little bit more when prices are down and a little bit less when prices are up. But consistency of return is something that we focus on as a general philosophy of the company, but also with regards to capital management.

So persistency is in line with what our expectations are. That's great. That's a big driver of the top line. But also, as you know, we've been putting gradual price increases into the market about every 6 months over the last 18 to 24 months. So sticky business is always good, but particularly when you're gradually increasing rates, particularly in group insurance to account for the low interest rate environment that we talked about. So I feel good about that. On the new business front, you'd sort of see a slight decline in sales this year. I think we're down about 3% in the fourth quarter. But as both Rick and Jack highlighted, actually, 4Q came in right in line with our expectations. We faced a really difficult comp, up 25% a year ago.

You have to remember, we've been doing this now, if you go back for the last 7 years. And so over that period of time, we've seen our stock price move up and down. Oftentimes, it's not related to what's going on in the company. And so we've taken advantage of some low stock prices. And at the same time, we've bought back shares when we were at a higher price.

When we think about the capital allocation to our Closed Block, that's not where we want to be putting our capital today. And so the numbers you see here today are higher than we want them to be. And I think that it gets back to the question that Jack was answering, is how do we free up that capital? How do we reduce the capital behind those lines of business, so that we can continue to do what we've been doing and funneling more capital to our operating companies? We're also in a fortunate position that we're generating enough capital as a company that our business lines, our main operating companies are getting the capital -- getting all the capital that they need to continue to generate growth. I think their constraint, only constraint is, more in the market, in making sure that it's good profitable growth as opposed to the amount of capital we can put behind it. So as we tell everyone inside the company is we want to funnel as much capital as we possibly can to continue to grow our lines of business. And what we haven't found is actually a shortfall to do so. And that's one of the reasons we're buying back a lot of stock, is because we actually can't put as much capital as we want to behind our growing lines that are generating very high returns. So back to your original question, I think that the capital we're allocating to our Closed Block is one that we want to reduce over time.

And so the question we have is, do we expect it to -- if it's money good, it's going to recover. Because ultimately, it's going to pay off and you'll get all your proceeds. And so again, it comes back to those things. Is it money good? Do we intend to hold it? Is it current? And clearly, the longer and lower it trades, kind of the more pressure and the more work you need to do to demonstrate that those first 3 are actually true and believable. But it is not a bright line issue."

One is, if we looked at the portfolio and said, if every single bond in our energy portfolio was downgraded a single notch, so BAA2 went to BAA3 and BAA3 went to BB, what would the impact be? That's a 4-point impact on our risk-based capital. The second tether point I'd give you, if everything dropped a full letter, so all our BBBs went to BBs, all of our As went to triple BBB, that would be a 15-point impact to our risk-based capital. It's -- calculating the impact on risk-based capital is more complicated than just looking at the change in the RBC factors because C1 capital gets tax-affected. And so that reduces the burden. There's also a significant diversification benefit with C1 capital that further reduces the impact relative to those numbers. So it's something that we really need to work through, but it's far less of an impact than just looking at the change in the percent capital holdings and multiplying them by 3.5."

We finished 2015 on a strong note with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, bringing the full year EPS to $3.64, which is an increase of 3.7%. We ended the year in the middle of our outlook range of 2% to 5%, which we were tracking to all year. I'm especially pleased with the balanced performance we continue to show on our core business segments. With good levels of premium growth, complemented by stable benefits experience across all lines, this combination helps to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company.
Our financial flexibility continues to be an important asset to us as we move into 2016, as we look to take advantage of the opportunities for profitable growth and to expand our leadership positions in the employee and voluntary benefits markets.
I will cover a few highlights for the fourth quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. I'll start with premium growth in our core business segments, which continues at a healthy and well-balanced pace. For the fourth quarter, premiums in each of our 3 core segments, Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, all increased by more than 5%. For Unum US, fourth quarter sales had a difficult comparison given the 25% jump we saw in the year-ago fourth quarter. But for the full year 2015, we generated an increase of just over 4%, at the top end of our expectations coming into 2015.
In addition, Unum US persistency trends remain favorable, and our ongoing focus on renewals helped drive the 5.5% increase in premium income. 
Unum UK sales in local currency improved in the fourth quarter with growth of 11%, driven largely by strong results in the core market long-term disability sales and large case Group Life sales. Combined with improving persistency and the benefit of a recently acquired dental business, Unum UK generated 5% growth in premiums in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, at Colonial Life, sales growth continues to be quite encouraging, increasing 5% for the fourth quarter and almost 7% for the full year, helping to generate premium growth of just over 5% for the quarter.
Next, it's important that we've not sacrificed the profitability of our core businesses to generate this premium growth, as our benefits experience has remained stable across all 3 business segments. In fact, the benefit ratios for the 3 core business segments improved for the full year 2015 relative to 2014.
Jack will provide additional detail on these trends in his commentary. Given these operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. This flexibility allows us to fund the capital required to grow our business, while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as we bought back $427 million of stock in 2015. In addition, we've continued to grow our book value per share with book value now at $35.90, an increase of 8.4% for the year, consistent with the growth we have generated since 2008. 
And finally, the macro environment, including the ongoing low interest rate environment, continues to present challenges. Interest rates and investment spreads remain below historical levels and below our portfolio yields. Our focus remains on actively managing through this environment by steadily taking pricing actions. But in the near term, it does continue to dampen our profit growth. 
So with these highlights on our fourth quarter performance, I'll have Jack cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results, and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the operating and business trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum US, where fourth quarter operating income was $214.2 million, an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter of $209.5 million. Premium income growth remains very healthy, increasing 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while the benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved slightly to 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the year-ago quarter.
The profitability of Unum US remained strong with an operating ROE of 13.1% for the fourth quarter, and 13.3% for the full year. Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our core -- in our group disability business was $66.1 million, an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter of $65.9 million. Premium income increased 5.5% over the year-ago quarter. But we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 5.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by lower asset levels, lower portfolio yields and lower miscellaneous investment income.
Benefits experience improved in the fourth quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 81.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 83.7% a year ago, driven primarily by lower claims incidence rates and favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line as well as favorable benefits experienced in our group short-term disability line.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $54.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow at a favorable level, increasing 5.2% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 72% for the fourth quarter compared to 70.8% in the year-ago quarter due to a higher average paid claim size for both the Group Life line and the AD&D line of business. While the benefit ratio was higher on a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter experience was generally consistent with the 71.8% benefit ratio for the full year 2015.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $93.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11.3% compared to $84.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong for this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
From the benefits perspective, results were in line with our expectation. The fourth quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 33.8% on an interest-adjusted basis and 48% for the voluntary benefits lines.
Looking at Unum UK, operating income was a GBP 24.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% over the year-ago quarter of GBP 24.1 million. The benefit ratio was 69.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 68.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher claim incidence trends in the group long-term disability and Group Life lines of business, which were partially offset by improved claim recoveries. Overall, profitability of the UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 20.6% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.
Colonial Life continues to generate strong, consistent results with operating income of $77.6 million, a 4.9% increase over the year-ago quarter of $74 million. The benefit ratio improved to 51.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 52.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the accident, sickness and disability product line. Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 16.4% this quarter and 16.6% for the full year.
Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the 2014 long-term care reserve charge. The benefits experienced for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest-adjusted loss ratio to 87.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 81% in the year-ago quarter was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher-than-normal level of miscellaneous net investment income. 
For the long-term care line, the interest-adjusted loss ratio was 89.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 89.6% for the year-ago quarter, excluding the reserve charge.
The underlying risk experience for long-term care was consistent with our long-term expectations for the full year 2015 interest-adjusted loss ratio of 87.6%, within our expected range of 85% to 90%. 
Regarding the reserve position for long-term care, we feel good about where we finished 2015 in terms of reserve adequacy. For the year, our new money yields exceeded our interest rate assumptions and risk results remained within our long term expectations. In addition, rate increase approvals and implementation are tracking in line with our reserve assumptions. One additional comment on long-term care, the cash flow testing reserve addition we recorded for our New York subsidiary, First Unum, was $68 million at year-end 2015. 
I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter.
Again, starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 3.7% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected as we had very strong sales results from the year-ago fourth quarter, and we continued to increase rates during the year. For the full year, Unum US sales increased by 4.2%, which was slightly above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth. 
Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the fourth quarter, but increased 7.2% for the full year. STD sales declined by 20% for the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for the full year, increasing by 0.8%. Our Group Life and AD&D, sales declined 2.5% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Also within Unum US, we had strong sales results in individual disability for the fourth quarter, increasing 30.4% to $21 million, driven by success with large case enrollments. 
Full-year sales growth for the individual disability line was 18.8%. Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core market voluntary benefit sales showed very good growth, while large case sales were lower against a very strong large case quarter last year.
Full year 2015 sales and voluntary benefits increased 10.3% with good balance between the core market and large case sales. Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US calls for growth rate in the 2% to 4% range again. It's likely that we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility of timing of large case sales.
Persistency for Unum US continues at healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was 90.3% for the full year 2015, which was stable with the 90.5% for 2014. Given these sales trends and persistency levels, along with the underlying management of inforce renewals, we generated premium income growth for Unum US this quarter of 5.5%. Full year premium growth was 6.4%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this segment and our strongest rate of growth in many years.
Sales in Unum UK rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, increasing 11.2% in local currency, with favorable trends in the core market group long-term disability product line and in Group Life. For the full year, sales grew by 6.2%. Persistency in the group disability line was 89.2% for the full year of 2015, off slightly from 2014 levels, but in line with our expectations.
Persistency for the Group Life line continue to recover at 80% for full year 2015, up from 76% in 2014. Premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 5.4% in local currency, including the impact of the acquisition of the dental business in the third quarter, and 2.3% for full year above our expectations of 0% to 2% growth.
Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on a positive trend, increasing 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for the full year. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial market sector, both core market sales and large case sales in the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower for the year at 78.5% compared to 79.4% for 2014. But premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Full year premium growth was also 5.1% well above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments as well as the profit margins we are maintaining.
Looking now at investment results. New money yields were slightly better in the fourth quarter compared to the first 9 months of 2015. However, today's new money yields remain below our current portfolio yields, so the downward pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability. We're actively raising prices in our markets to help manage this impact. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. Our overall default experience relative to the Moody's index was again very favorable at 15 basis points for full year 2015 compared to 80 basis points for the index. 
I'd like to give you an update on our energy-related holdings, which totaled $5 billion or 11.6% of our total fixed maturity securities at year-end 2015.
The severe widening of credit spreads in the energy sector during the fourth quarter reduced the net unrealized gain from $302.8 million as of September 30, 2015 to a net unrealized loss of $51.4 million at December 31, 2015.
We saw relatively more spread widening in the oilfield services and independent oil and gas sectors of our portfolio. As we discussed with you at our outlook meeting in December, these sectors tend to be the most sensitive companies to oil prices. The sectors represent 4% and 29.8% of our energy holdings, respectively, and had a net unrealized loss of $114.9 million as of year-end.
The remaining 2/3 of our energy holdings are in midstream companies, integrated oil companies and refiners. These holdings are much less sensitive to oil prices and have a net unrealized gain of $63.5 million at year-end. Our exposure to below-investment grade energy credits declined slightly in the quarter to 14.1% of the energy holdings compared to 14.8% at the end of the third quarter.
Approximately 3/4 of the below-investment grade exposure is the more highly rated BB category. Realized losses in energy holdings from both losses on sales and from impairments were $20.1 million pretax for the fourth quarter.
We have thoroughly reviewed our energy holdings and looked at a number of stress scenarios. While downgrade of holdings and some impairments may happen over time, we feel the impacts are very manageable and did not alter our financial or capital plans. 
Moving to capital management. We continue to see very favorable trends. We repurchased $100 million of our stock this quarter, bringing the total repurchases to $427 million in full year 2015, which is approximately 4.9% of our year-end 2014 outstanding shares. We estimate we closed the year with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies at approximately 400%, consistent with the levels we've held throughout the year and towards the higher end of our expected range for the year. Holding company cash and marketable securities was $475 million at year-end, and statutory operating earnings were $182.4 million for the fourth quarter and $689.2 million for full year 2015, a strong sales level of earnings and an 11.5% increase over 2014.
Finally, I'll note our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 28.5% was favorable relative to the 30.9% rate that we recorded for the first 3 quarters of the year. This was primarily driven by a reduction in our deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations as a result of the enactment of future reductions in the U.K. tax rate and also the benefit of the extension of active financing in the fourth quarter that reversed the tax expense we recorded in the third quarter.
Wrapping up, our expectation for after-tax operating income per share for 2016 has not changed from what we previously discussed at our outlook meeting in December. We did finish 2015 with a higher level of income than we had anticipated. So the growth rate for 2016 off of the $3.64 of 2015 operating income per share is expected to be within a range of 3% to 6%. So overall, it was a very good fourth quarter and a very strong full year performance for the company. Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

Where it does actually meet up with how we think about managing the capital of the company is we are buying back our shares and have been doing so for the last several years. So when you look at that, you think about where we're buying back shares today relative to where we were even in the fourth quarter and for over the average of the year and how does it impact our thinking. And what I take you to, this gets to your philosophical point, is we actually, on that front, stay very consistent as well. So we think about it ourselves as a steady returner of capital to our shareholders. We'll buy a little bit more when prices are down and a little bit less when prices are up. But consistency of return is something that we focus on as a general philosophy of the company, but also with regards to capital management. So as we look at where our share price is today, we'll be buying a lot more shares.

As we think about your capital allocation across your businesses, it seems like the portion that's allocated to the Closed Block is, I don't know, almost a little over 1/3 of your capital, maybe 35%, 36%. Is that -- does that factor into your thinking? In other words, is there a limit in terms of how much, how big you want that allocation to be? It would seem to me that most of the capital that you're using for share repurchase is coming out of the operating segment. So naturally, there would be some upward drift in that allocation. Just want to get a sense of how, should we be thinking about that number? Is it a binding constraint at all? Any help would be -- any guidance would be helpful."

When we think about the capital allocation to our Closed Block, that's not where we want to be putting our capital today. And so the numbers you see here today are higher than we want them to be. And I think that it gets back to the question that Jack was answering, is how do we free up that capital? How do we reduce the capital behind those lines of business, so that we can continue to do what we've been doing and funneling more capital to our operating companies? We're also in a fortunate position that we're generating enough capital as a company that our business lines, our main operating companies are getting the capital -- getting all the capital that they need to continue to generate growth. I think their constraint, only constraint is, more in the market, in making sure that it's good profitable growth as opposed to the amount of capital we can put behind it. So as we tell everyone inside the company is we want to funnel as much capital as we possibly can to continue to grow our lines of business. And what we haven't found is actually a shortfall to do so. And that's one of the reasons we're buying back a lot of stock, is because we actually can't put as much capital as we want to behind our growing lines that are generating very high returns. So back to your original question, I think that the capital we're allocating to our Closed Block is one that we want to reduce over time. And as we've talked about in different settings, that's something we're actively working on as a company."

The second tether point I'd give you, if everything dropped a full letter, so all our BBBs went to BBs, all of our As went to triple BBB, that would be a 15-point impact to our risk-based capital. It's -- calculating the impact on risk-based capital is more complicated than just looking at the change in the RBC factors because C1 capital gets tax-affected. And so that reduces the burden. There's also a significant diversification benefit with C1 capital that further reduces the impact relative to those numbers. So it's something that we really need to work through, but it's far less of an impact than just looking at the change in the percent capital holdings and multiplying them by 3.5."

We're happy to be taking you through our first quarter results, which were a strong start for to the year. Overall, we saw first quarter operating income per share at $0.95, which was an increase of just under 7% over last year. 
There are continued positive operating trends underlying this. This starts with solid levels of premium growth across all 3 of our core business segments and also included stable benefits experience. This performance continues to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company giving us lots of flexibility. We're consistently said that our financial flexibility is an important asset. I believe our first quarter actions demonstrated that point, as we are not only maintained capital deployment through share repurchases at a time when our shares were trading lower, but we also invested in our future growth with an announcement of our agreement to acquire Star Monk Life Insurance company. We believe this transaction will help us capitalize on the growth opportunity in the dental market, which is very consistent with our employee benefits focus.
Now let's get to a few key highlights of the first quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. 
To begin, I'd like to highlight the premium growth. We continue to see in our core business segments. For the first quarter, premiums in the Unum US, Unum UK and Conolial Life all showed very good momentum with roughly 6% growth rates. For Unum US, we generated premium growth of 5.8% for the first quarter, with good persistency trends, strong contributions from our renewables programs and pricing actions and our 2015 sales levels. New sales did decline in the first quarter, due to some increased competition we're seeing in the market, and also some difficult sales comparisons. It's an area, where we continue to be disciplined, and we will continue to take price, where we see it needed. 
Unum UK premium growth in local currency improved 6.1% in the first quarter with the benefit of National Dental Plan acquisition we did in the middle of last year. 
And finally, at Colonial Life, premium growth for the first quarter was 5.7%, driven by the very positive sales trends we have seen over the past 2.5 years, which continued again this quarter with the new sales growth of 16%, our strongest rate of sales growth in many years. 
Next with this improvement in premium growth over the past several quarters, I'm especially pleased that we've maintained the profitability of our core business. I believe this demonstrates our disciplined approach to our markets and how we price, underwrite and go through our renewal process, once we have placed business on our books. It can be challenging in today's low interest rate environment to continually move price increases into the market, but our teams are doing a commendable job of managing the balance required between generating top line growth and maintaining profit margins. 
With these strong operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. As I mentioned, this flexibility was especially evident this quarter with the repurchase of $100 million of our shares at various attractive levels. 
Along with the announcement of our planned acquisition of Stormont Life Insurance company, which we expect to close in the third quarter. The Stormont acquisition is consistent with our desire to invest in the growth of our core businesses and we believe will provide an attractive national platform for us and a scalable infrastructure to profitably grow in the dental market.
Stormont also brings a team that has a strong cultural fit with Unum and how we serve our customers. We're excited about this strategic transaction, which will help us expand our customers relationship both within Unum US and Colonial Life operations. In addition to all this, our book will per share, excluding AOCI continues to grow at a steady pace, ending the quarter at $36.68, an increase of 8.6% from a year ago. 
Overall, it was a very good quarter with our core operations driving steady, stable growth and our capital management actions continuing to deliver value for our shareholders.
So with those highlights on a very good first quarter, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our first quarter results, and now, I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum US, where first quarter operating income was $215.9 million, an increase of 0.7% from the year-ago quarter of $214.3 million. 
Premium income growth remained very healthy, increasing 5.8% over the year ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment was favorable at 69.3% in the first quarter, although, it was slightly higher than the very favorable 68.3% in the year ago quarter. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management also contributed to the operating results.
The profitability of Unum US remains very strong with an operating ROE of 14.4% for the first quarter compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter. 
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability was $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 5.2% from the year ago quarter of $74.3 million. 
Premium income increased 6.3% over the year ago quarter, but we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 3.4% compared to the year ago quarter, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. 
 
The benefit ratio of 80.6% in the first quarter was at the favorable end of our expectations, although, it was higher than the very favorable 80.1% benefit ratio we experienced in the first quarter of last year.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $55.4 million for the first quarter, a decline of 4.3% from the year ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow, increasing 5% over the year ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 71.5% for the first quarter compared to 70.9% in the year ago quarter, due to increased incidence and a higher average claim size. 
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines were very strong at $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 9.7% compared to the $82.1 million in the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong in the line of business increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year. 
From a benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. The first quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 50.9% compared to 48.9% in the year ago quarter, as new claim incidence rates were slightly higher. 
For the voluntary benefits line, the first quarter 2016 benefit ratio was 43.8% compared to 40.9% in the year ago quarter. Underlying claims experience for the voluntary line was stable in the quarter with the increase in the benefit ratio being driven by the change in active life reserves, resulting from fewer policy terminations in the current quarter compared to the year ago quarter.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 23.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 9.3% over the year ago quarter of GBP 21.5 million. Premium income increased 6.1% over the year ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and growth in the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 67.9% for the first quarter compared to 65.3% in the year ago quarter. Higher claims incidence trends in the group life line of business and the impact of inflation linked benefit changes were partially offset by more favorable experience in group disability. 
Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 17.7% for the first quarter compared to 16.1% in the year ago quarter. 
Conolial Life again generated strong consistent results with operating income of $77.4 million compared to $77.6 million in the year ago quarter. 
The slight decline in operating income was driven by lower net investment income reflecting lower miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio improved to 50.9% in the first quarter compared to 51.3% for the year ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the accident and sickness and critical illness product lines.
Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 17.7% compared to 16.9% in the year ago quarter. 
Finally, for the closed block, operating income was $33.7 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $26.7 million in the year ago quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher miscellaneous investment income compared to a very low level of miscellaneous investment income in the year ago quarter. 
The underlying benefits experience for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84% in the first quarter compared to 80% in the year ago quarter was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher level of bond calls and bond tenders we experienced during the first quarter of 2016.
For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.9% for the first quarter compared to 87.3% for the year ago quarter, resulting from a higher average submitted claim size. 
The underlying risk experience for long-term care remains within our long-term expected range of 85% to 90%. 
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 4.5% for the first quarter compared to year ago, this was not unexpected as we had a very strong core market sales results the year ago first quarter, and we continue to see the increased rates offset interest rate pressure. However, we also saw increased competition in the quarter particularly in the mid-market. 
Looking at the sales results by product line. LTD sales were flat in the first quarter, while STD sales declined 32.5% compared to the year ago quarter. LTD sales improved in the large scale segment, due to strong sales through existing customers offsetting lower sales in the core market segment. Group Life and AD&D sales declined 4.9% for the quarter, as we continue to take disciplined pricing approach to this market. 
Our individual disability sales increased 35.8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. 
Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 4.5% against a very strong first quarter last year, which included a $25 million single large case sale. 
Core market sales for voluntary benefits performed very well in the quarter, increasing 16%.
Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US cause for growth in the 2% to 4% range again, and it's likely we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly, given the volatility on the timing of large case sales. 
Persistency for Unum US continues at very healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was stable at 88.8%. Voluntary persistency of 76.7% was favorable to prior year results, and individual disability persistency of 91.3% improved over the first quarter of last year. 
Given recent sales trends and strong persistency levels along with the underlying management of our in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth of 5.8% for Unum US this quarter. 
Sales in the U.K. were strong as well, increasing 16.4% in local currency with favorable trends in core markets for both group long-term disability and group life, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition, and an increase in other supplemental product sales. 
Persistency was favorable at 85.6%, due to improvements across the product lines. 
Given these trends, premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 6.1% in local currency.
Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on an accelerating trend, increasing 16% for the first quarter. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial sector both core market sales and large case sales and the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth trends. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but it remains in line with our expectations. 
Premium growth continues to show good momentum increasing 5.7% in the first quarter compared to the year ago quarter. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our business segments as well as the profit margins we are maintaining. 
Looking now at investment results. New money yields were in the first quarter by declining yields for both 10-year and 30-year treasuries, despite this, we're again able to slightly exceed the new money yields assumptions we have for our long-term care portfolio just as we did throughout 2015. 
Given the recent volatility in oil prices, I'd like to give an update on our energy holdings. As we told you last quarter, we believe our energy exposure is very manageable within our existing capital plans. The sharp increase in oil prices, since we last talked has further strengthened our outlook for the portfolio. The portfolio ended the quarter in a net unrealized gain position of $18.9 million compared to a net unrealized loss position of $51.4 million at year end 2015. 
The size of the portfolio also shrunk modestly.
During the first quarter, the unrating agencies undertook a comprehensive review of energy credits. As a result of that review along with other portfolio management actions, our below investment grade energy exposure increased by $66 million. The impact of all the rating changes to our RBC ratios for the traditional U.S. insurance companies was only 2 RBC points. It's worth noting that the impact of rating changes to RBC ratio is heavily impacted by a company's ratio of C2 risk to C1 and C3 risk. Since we are more heavily weighted to C2 risk, the impact of these downgrades to our RBC ratios tends to be lower. 
Net realized losses in the energy holdings from both gains and losses on sale as well as other than temporary impairments were $24 million pretax for the first quarter. These losses were partially offset by realized gains in the rest of the portfolio. We continue to review our energy holdings and examine those holdings through a number of stress scenarios. 
Current oil prices are higher than our baseline scenario, and our experience in the first quarter was consistent and in some cases better than we expected. In summary, we continue to believe that the capital impacts of our energy holdings are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans.
Moving to capital management. It was an active and very productive quarter for us. Our share repurchases totaled $100 million with most of that activity occurring, while the stock was trading up in February, thereby, enabling us to buy the shares at an average price of just over $27 per share. 
As a result, we retired 1.5% of our shares making a very productive use of our excess capital. In addition, as Rick highlighted, we announced the planned acquisition of Stormont Life Insurance company, which we believe will provide us with a platform to begin to develop a substantial national dental and vision business overtime benefiting the growth prospects for both Unum US and Colonial Life. 
This transaction won't close until the third quarter and is being financed in such a way that we expect to remain well, within our capital ranges, while maintaining our share repurchases plans. Also on capital management, we typically see a reduction in our holding company cash in the first quarter. This we decided to maintain the dividends we take from our insurance companies in 2016 at approximately the same level as 2015, but we decided to adjust the quarterly pattern. 
Therefore, we took a $179 million of dividends in the first quarter, about $35 million higher than the year ago quarter. As a result, our holding company liquidity position remained stable at $478 million compared to $475 million at year-end 2015. 
In addition, we've extended our $400 million credit facility by a new 5-year period to provide added flexibility. The higher statutory dividend, along with the growth in previously discussed downgrades, caused our risk-based capital ratio to slightly lower were at approximately 390% compared to approximately 400% at year-end 2015. 
We continue to target our risk-based capital ratio in a range of 375% to 400% for the year, and holding company liquidity is at least 1x our holding company cash coverage needs of just over $300 million this year. 
Statutory after-tax operating earnings were quite strong for the first quarter at $184 million, compared to $158 million in the year ago quarter, a nice 16% increase. 
Wrapping up, our expectations for the growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged from what we discussed from when we reported the fourth quarter with this growth rate within the range of 3% to 6%. Overall, it was a very good start to the year, we're pleased with the operating results and feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility. Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

I guess, I'd start by just saying we feel really good about the strength of the product portfolio and expanding product portfolio. The distribution relationships are rock solid in the service proposition. So I think that's just important context. As you highlighted, we do have a tough comparison here in the first quarter. A year ago sales were up in the high teens. But even given the tough comparison, if you sort of unpack the aggregate sales number here in first quarter of '16, there is some pretty encouraging trends within our soft and voluntary segment, we saw VB as Jack highlighted, grow by 610% in the quarter, and actually large case VB had really good momentum as well. We had $25 million sale last year to an existing client. 
To give you a sense, this year, our biggest VB sale was just a little under $4 million. So broad-based, I think traction and success with voluntary. And also in the segment, recently issued IDI sales were up 36%, and that's a been a really good story for us and fits with our strategy of selling multiple lines into existing clients. 
As you highlighted, the soft spot for us was new group insurance sales, and we felt that most acutely in what we would call the mid-market, which is sort of employers 258 to our 2000 lives. To give you a sense, proposal activity in that segment was actually up in the low double digits. So good traction in terms of taking good looks at opportunities, but our ability to close that business was definitely constrained by an increasingly aggressive underwriting environment out there. We saw that materialize a bit in the second half of last year, and it's definitely persisted here into the first quarter of 2016. We have seen this cycle many times. So we're going to maintain our discipline. We'll certainly, look to write business is when we can do so profitably, but we're going to have to, I think keep it real close eye on it. 
Group insurance, this is our smallest sales quarter of the year. So a lot of work to transpire between now and the end of the year, but the competitive market is 1 we're going to watch really closely on the new sales front. I guess, the final thing I'd say is renewal placement activity, another place where you'd see competition, we are really pleased with the ability to place rate increase due to the interest rate environment and persistency hanging in just a tick below 90% on premium growth up about 6%, so feel good in aggregate, but watching the new sales environment is going to be really important."

We're happy to be taking you through our first quarter results, which were a strong start to the year. Overall, we saw first quarter operating income per share at $0.95, which was an increase of just under 7% over last year.
There are continued positive operating trends underlying this. This starts with solid levels of premium growth across all 3 of our core business segments and also included stable benefits experience. This performance continues to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company giving us lots of flexibility. We've consistently said that our financial flexibility is an important asset. I believe our first quarter actions demonstrated that point as we not only maintained capital deployment through share repurchases at a time when our shares were trading lower, but we also invested in our future growth with an announcement of our agreement to acquire Starmount Life Insurance Company. We believe this transaction will help us capitalize on the growth opportunity in the dental market, which is very consistent with our employee benefits focus.
Now let's get to a few key highlights of the first quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail.
To begin, I'd like to highlight the premium growth we continue to see in our core business segments. For the first quarter, premiums in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life all showed very good momentum with roughly 6% growth rates. For Unum US, we generated premium growth of 5.8% for the first quarter, with good persistency trends, strong contributions from our renewal programs and pricing actions and our 2015 sales levels. New sales did decline in the first quarter due to some increased competition we're seeing in the market and also some difficult sales comparisons. It's an area we will continue to be disciplined, and we will continue to take price where we see it is needed.
Unum UK premium growth in local currency improved 6.1% in the first quarter with the benefit of the National Dental Plan acquisition we did in the middle of last year.
And finally, at Colonial Life, premium growth for the first quarter was 5.7%, driven by the very positive sales trends we have seen over the past 2.5 years, which continued again this quarter with a new sales growth of 16%, our strongest rate of sales growth in many years.
Next, with this improvement in premium growth over the past several quarters, I'm especially pleased that we've maintained the profitability of our core business. I believe this demonstrates our disciplined approach to our markets in how we price, underwrite and go through our renewal process once we have placed business on our books. It can be challenging in today's low interest rate environment to continually move price increases into the market, but our teams are doing a commendable job of managing the balance required between generating top line growth and maintaining profit margins.
With these strong operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. As I mentioned, this flexibility was especially evident this quarter with the repurchase of $100 million of our shares at very attractive levels, along with the announcement of our planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
The Starmount acquisition is consistent with our desire to invest in the growth of our core businesses and we believe will provide an attractive national platform for us and a scalable infrastructure to profitably grow in the dental market. Starmount also brings a team that has a strong cultural fit with Unum in how we serve our customers. We're excited about this strategic transaction, which will help us expand our customer relationships both within Unum US and Colonial Life operations.
In addition to all this, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, continues to grow at a steady pace, ending the quarter at $36.68, an increase of 8.6% from a year ago.
Overall, it was a very good quarter with our core operations driving steady, stable growth and our capital management actions continuing to deliver value for our shareholders.
So with those highlights on a very good first quarter, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our first quarter results, and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum US, where first quarter operating income was $215.9 million, an increase of 0.7% from the year-ago quarter of $214.3 million.
Premium income growth remained very healthy, increasing 5.8% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment was favorable at 69.3% in the first quarter, although it was slightly higher than the very favorable 68.3% in the year-ago quarter. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management also contributed to the operating results.
The profitability of Unum US remain very strong with an operating ROE of 14.4% for the first quarter compared to 13.5% in the year-ago quarter.
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter of $74.3 million.
Premium income increased 6.3% over the year-ago quarter, but we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 3.4% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields.
The benefit ratio of 80.6% in the first quarter was at the favorable end of our expectations, although it was higher than the very favorable 80.1% benefit ratio we experienced in the first quarter of last year.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $55.4 million for the first quarter, a decline of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow, increasing 5% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 71.5% for the first quarter compared to 70.9% in the year-ago quarter due to increased incidence and a higher average claim size.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines were very -- was very strong at $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 9.7% compared to the $82.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong in this of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
From a benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. The first quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 50.9% compared to 48.9% in the year-ago quarter as new claim incidence rates were slightly higher.
For the voluntary benefits line, the first quarter 2016 benefit ratio was 43.8% compared to 40.9% in the year-ago quarter. Underlying claims experience for the voluntary line was stable in the quarter with the increase in the benefit ratio being driven by the change in active life reserves resulting from fewer policy terminations in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 23.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 9.3% over the year-ago quarter of GBP 21.5 million. Premium income increased 6.1% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and growth in the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 67.9% for the first quarter compared to 65.3% in the year-ago quarter. Higher claims incidence trend in the Group Life line of business and the impact of inflation-linked benefit changes were partially offset by more favorable experience in group disability.
Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 17.7% for the first quarter compared to 16.1% in the year-ago quarter.
Colonial Life again generated strong, consistent results with operating income of $77.4 million compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in operating income was driven by lower net investment income reflecting lower miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio improved to 50.9% in the first quarter compared to 51.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the accident and sickness and critical illness product lines.
Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 17.7% compared to 16.9% in the year-ago quarter.
Finally, for the closed block, operating income was $33.7 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $26.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher miscellaneous investment income compared to a very low level of miscellaneous investment income in the year-ago quarter.
The underlying benefits experience for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84% in the first quarter compared to 80% in the year-ago quarter was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher level of bond calls and bond tenders we experienced during the first quarter of 2016.
For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.9% for the first quarter compared to 87.3% for the year-ago quarter, resulting from a higher average submitted claim size. The underlying risk experience for long-term care remains within our long-term expected range of 85% to 90%.
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 4.5% for the first quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected as we had a very strong core market sales results a year ago first quarter, and we continue to see the increased rates offset interest rate pressure. However, we also saw increased competition in the quarter particularly in the mid-market.
Looking at the sales results by product line. LTD sales were flat in the first quarter, while STD sales declined 32.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. LTD sales improved in the large case segment due to strong sales through existing customers offsetting lower sales in the core market segment. Group Life and AD&D sales declined 4.9% for the quarter as we continue to take disciplined pricing approach to this market.
Our individual disability sales increased 35.8% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers.
Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 4.5% against a very strong first quarter last year, which included a $25 million single large case sale.
Core market sales for voluntary benefits performed very well in the quarter, increasing 16%.
Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US calls for growth in the 2% to 4% range again, and it's likely we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility on the timing of large case sales.
Persistency for Unum US continues at very healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was stable at 88.8%. Voluntary persistency of 76.7% was favorable to prior year results and individual disability persistency of 91.3% improved over the first quarter of last year.
Given recent sales trends and strong persistency levels, along with the underlying management of our in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth of 5.8% for Unum US this quarter.
Sales in the U.K. were strong as well, increasing 16.4% in local currency with favorable trends in core markets for both group long-term disability and group life, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition and an increase in other supplemental product sales. Persistency was favorable at 85.6% due to improvements across the product lines. Given these trends, premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 6.1% in local currency.
Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on an accelerating trend, increasing 16% for the first quarter. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial sector, both core market sales and large case sales in the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth trends. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but it remains in line with our expectations. Premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.7% in the first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our business segments as well as the profit margins we are maintaining.
Looking now at investment results. New money yields were pressured in the first quarter by declining yields for both 10-year and 30-year Treasuries. Despite this, we're again able to slightly exceed the new money yield assumptions we have for our long-term care portfolio just as we did throughout 2015.
Given the recent volatility in oil prices, I'd like to give you an update on our energy holdings. As we told you last quarter, we believe our energy exposure is very manageable within our existing capital plans. The sharp increase in oil prices since we last talked has further strengthened our outlook for the portfolio. The portfolio ended the quarter in a net unrealized gain position of $18.9 million compared to a net unrealized loss position of $51.4 million at year-end 2015. The size of the portfolio also shrunk modestly.
During the first quarter, rating agencies undertook a comprehensive review of energy credit. As a result of that review, along with other portfolio management actions, our below investment grade energy exposure increased by $66 million. The impact of all the rating changes to our RBC ratios for the traditional U.S. insurance companies was only 2 RBC points. It's worth noting that the impact of rating changes to RBC ratio is heavily impacted by a company's ratio of C2 risk to C1 and C3 risk. Since we are more heavily weighted to C2 risk, the impact of these downgrades to our RBC ratio tends to be lower.
Net realized losses in the energy holdings from both gains and losses on sale as well as other than temporary impairment were $24 million pretax for the first quarter. These losses were partially offset by realized gains in the rest of the portfolio. We continue to review our energy holdings and examine those holdings through a number of stress scenarios.
Current oil prices are higher than our baseline scenario, and our experience in the first quarter was consistent and in some cases better than we expected. In summary, we continue to believe that the capital impact of our energy holdings are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans.
Moving to capital management. It was an active and very productive quarter for us. Our share repurchases totaled $100 million with most of that activity occurring while the stock was trading up in February, thereby enabling us to buy the shares at an average price of just over $27 per share.
As a result, we retired 1.5% of our shares, making a very productive use of our excess capital. In addition, as Rick highlighted, we announced the planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company, which we believe will provide us with a platform to begin to develop a substantial national dental and vision business over time, benefiting the growth prospects for both Unum US and Colonial Life.
This transaction won't close until the third quarter and is being financed in such a way that we expect to remain well within our capital ranges, while maintaining our share repurchase plans. Also on capital management, we typically see a reduction in our holding company cash in the first quarter. This year, we decided to maintain the dividends we take from our insurance companies in 2016 at approximately the same level as 2015, but we decided to adjust the quarterly pattern.
Therefore, we took a $179 million of dividends in the first quarter, about $35 million higher than the year-ago quarter. As a result, our holding company liquidity position remained stable at $478 million compared to $475 million at year-end 2015.
In addition, we've extended our $400 million credit facility by a new 5-year period to provide added flexibility. The higher statutory dividend, along with the growth in previously discussed downgrades, caused our risk-based capital ratio to slightly lower at approximately 390% compared to approximately 400% at year-end 2015.
We continue to target our risk-based capital ratio in a range of 375% to 400% for the year, and holding company liquidity is at least 1x our holding company cash coverage needs of just over $300 million this year.
Statutory after-tax operating earnings were quite strong for the first quarter at $184 million compared to $158 million in the year-ago quarter, a nice 16% increase.
Wrapping up, our expectations for the growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged from what we discussed when we reported the fourth quarter, which is a growth rate within a range of 3% to 6%. Overall, it was a very good start to the year, we're pleased with the operating results and feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility.
Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

I guess, I'd start by just saying we feel really good about the strength of the product portfolio and expanding product portfolio. The distribution relationship is rock-solid and the service proposition. So I think that's just important context. As you highlighted, we do have a tough comparison here in the first quarter. A year ago, sales were up in the high teens. But even given the tough comparison, if you sort of unpack the aggregate sales number here in first quarter of '16, there's some pretty encouraging trend. Within our supp and voluntary segment, we saw VB, as Jack highlighted, grow by 16% in the quarter. And actually large case VB had really good momentum as well. We had the $25 million sale last year to an existing client. To give you a sense, this year, our biggest VB sale was just a little under $4 million. So broad-based, I think, traction and success with voluntary. And also in the segment, recently issued IDI sales were up 36%. And that's a been a really good story for us and fits with our strategy of selling multiple lines into existing clients.
As you highlighted, the soft spot for us was new group insurance sales, and we felt that most acutely in what we would call the mid-market, which is sort of employers 250 to 2,000 lives. To give you a sense, proposal activity in that segment was actually up in the low double digits. So good traction in terms of taking good looks at opportunities, but our ability to close that business was definitely constrained by an increasingly aggressive underwriting environment out there. We saw that materialize a bit in the second half of last year, and it's definitely persisted here into the first quarter of 2016. We have seen this cycle many times. So we're going to maintain our discipline. We'll certainly look to write business where we can do so profitably, but we're going to have to, I think, keep a real close eye on it.
Group insurance, this is our smallest sales quarter of the year. So a lot of work to transpire between now and the end of the year, but the competitive market is one we're going to watch really closely on the new sales front. And I guess the final thing I'd say is renewal placement activity, another place where you'd see competition. We're really pleased with the ability to place rate increase due to the interest rate environment and persistency hanging in just a tick below 90%, earned premium growth up about 6%. So feel good in aggregate, but watching the new sales environment is going to be really important."

It has been a market that sort of been a slow growth market that ticked up a bit. And it's been a really good story for us here at Unum. I mentioned, sales were up about 36% in the first quarter, most of that coming off block growth opportunities. Often it's cross sold with our group insurance and voluntary lines, and we've got it to a place now where the top line is growing about 5%. So it's a good market for us.

We're happy to be taking you through our first quarter results, which were a strong start to the year. Overall, we saw first quarter operating income per share at $0.95, which was an increase of just unde",732,"Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We're happy to be taking you through our first quarter results, which were a strong start to the year. Overall, we saw first quarter operating income per share at $0.95, which was an increase of just under 7% over last year.
There are continued positive operating trends underlying this. This starts with solid levels of premium growth across all 3 of our core business segments and also included stable benefits experience. This performance continues to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company giving us lots of flexibility. We've consistently said that our financial flexibility is an important asset. I believe our first quarter actions demonstrated that point as we not only maintained capital deployment through share repurchases at a time when our shares were trading lower, but we also invested in our future growth with an announcement of our agreement to acquire Starmount Life Insurance Company. We believe this transaction will help us capitalize on the growth opportunity in the dental market, which is very consistent with our employee benefits focus.
Now let's get to a few key highlights of the first quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail.
To begin, I'd like to highlight the premium growth we continue to see in our core business segments. For the first quarter, premiums in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life all showed very good momentum with roughly 6% growth rates. For Unum US, we generated premium growth of 5.8% for the first quarter, with good persistency trends, strong contributions from our renewal programs and pricing actions and our 2015 sales levels. New sales did decline in the first quarter due to some increased competition we're seeing in the market and also some difficult sales comparisons. It's an area we will continue to be disciplined, and we will continue to take price where we see it is needed.
Unum UK premium growth in local currency improved 6.1% in the first quarter with the benefit of the National Dental Plan acquisition we did in the middle of last year.
And finally, at Colonial Life, premium growth for the first quarter was 5.7%, driven by the very positive sales trends we have seen over the past 2.5 years, which continued again this quarter with a new sales growth of 16%, our strongest rate of sales growth in many years.
Next, with this improvement in premium growth over the past several quarters, I'm especially pleased that we've maintained the profitability of our core business. I believe this demonstrates our disciplined approach to our markets in how we price, underwrite and go through our renewal process once we have placed business on our books. It can be challenging in today's low interest rate environment to continually move price increases into the market, but our teams are doing a commendable job of managing the balance required between generating top line growth and maintaining profit margins.
With these strong operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. As I mentioned, this flexibility was especially evident this quarter with the repurchase of $100 million of our shares at very attractive levels, along with the announcement of our planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
The Starmount acquisition is consistent with our desire to invest in the growth of our core businesses and we believe will provide an attractive national platform for us and a scalable infrastructure to profitably grow in the dental market. Starmount also brings a team that has a strong cultural fit with Unum in how we serve our customers. We're excited about this strategic transaction, which will help us expand our customer relationships both within Unum US and Colonial Life operations.
In addition to all this, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, continues to grow at a steady pace, ending the quarter at $36.68, an increase of 8.6% from a year ago.
Overall, it was a very good quarter with our core operations driving steady, stable growth and our capital management actions continuing to deliver value for our shareholders.
So with those highlights on a very good first quarter, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our first quarter results, and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum US, where first quarter operating income was $215.9 million, an increase of 0.7% from the year-ago quarter of $214.3 million.
Premium income growth remained very healthy, increasing 5.8% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment was favorable at 69.3% in the first quarter, although it was slightly higher than the very favorable 68.3% in the year-ago quarter. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management also contributed to the operating results.
The profitability of Unum US remains very strong with an operating ROE of 14.4% for the first quarter compared to 13.5% in the year-ago quarter.
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter of $74.3 million.
Premium income increased 6.3% over the year-ago quarter, but we continued to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 3.4% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields.
The benefit ratio of 80.6% in the first quarter was at the favorable end of our expectations, although it was higher than the very favorable 80.1% benefit ratio we experienced in the first quarter of last year.
Group Life and AD&D operating income was $55.4 million for the first quarter, a decline of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow, increasing 5% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 71.5% for the first quarter compared to 70.9% in the year-ago quarter due to increased incidence and a higher average claim size.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines were very -- was very strong at $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 9.7% compared to the $82.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong in this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.
From a benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. The first quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 50.9% compared to 48.9% in the year-ago quarter as new claim incidence rates were slightly higher.
For the voluntary benefits line, the first quarter 2016 benefit ratio was 43.8% compared to 40.9% in the year-ago quarter. Underlying claims experience for the voluntary line was stable in the quarter with the increase in the benefit ratio being driven by the change in active life reserves resulting from fewer policy terminations in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 23.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 9.3% over the year-ago quarter of GBP 21.5 million. Premium income increased 6.1% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and growth in the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 67.9% for the first quarter compared to 65.3% in the year-ago quarter. Higher claims incidence trend in the Group Life line of business and the impact of inflation-linked benefit changes were partially offset by more favorable experience in group disability.
Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 17.7% for the first quarter compared to 16.1% in the year-ago quarter.
Colonial Life again generated strong, consistent results with operating income of $77.4 million compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in operating income was driven by lower net investment income reflecting lower miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio improved to 50.9% in the first quarter compared to 51.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the accident and sickness and critical illness product lines.
Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 17.7% compared to 16.9% in the year-ago quarter.
Finally, for the closed block, operating income was $33.7 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $26.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher miscellaneous investment income compared to a very low level of miscellaneous investment income in the year-ago quarter.
The underlying benefits experience for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84% in the first quarter compared to 80% in the year-ago quarter was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher level of bond calls and bond tenders we experienced during the first quarter of 2016.
For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.9% for the first quarter compared to 87.3% for the year-ago quarter, resulting from a higher average submitted claim size. The underlying risk experience for long-term care remains within our long-term expected range of 85% to 90%.
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined by 4.5% for the first quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected as we had a very strong core market sales results a year ago first quarter, and we continue to see the increased rates to offset interest rate pressure. However, we also saw increased competition in the quarter particularly in the mid-market.
Looking at the sales results by product line. LTD sales were flat in the first quarter, while STD sales declined 32.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. LTD sales improved in the large case segment due to strong sales through existing customers offsetting lower sales in the core market segment. Group Life and AD&D sales declined 4.9% for the quarter as we continue to take disciplined pricing approach to this market.
Our individual disability sales increased 35.8% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers.
Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 4.5% against a very strong first quarter last year, which included a $25 million single large case sale.
Core market sales for voluntary benefits performed very well in the quarter, increasing 16%.
Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum US calls for growth in the 2% to 4% range again, and it's likely we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility on the timing of large case sales.
Persistency for Unum US continues at very healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was stable at 88.8%. Voluntary persistency of 76.7% was favorable to prior year results and individual disability persistency of 91.3% improved over the first quarter of last year.
Given recent sales trends and strong persistency levels, along with the underlying management of our in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth of 5.8% for Unum US this quarter.
Sales in the U.K. were strong as well, increasing 16.4% in local currency with favorable trends in core markets for both group long-term disability and group life, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition and an increase in other supplemental product sales. Persistency was favorable at 85.6% due to improvements across the product lines. Given these trends, premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 6.1% in local currency.
Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on an accelerating trend, increasing 16% for the first quarter. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial sector, both core market sales and large case sales in the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth trends. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but it remains in line with our expectations. Premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.7% in the first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our business segments as well as the profit margins we are maintaining.
Looking now at investment results. New money yields were pressured in the first quarter by declining yields for both 10-year and 30-year Treasuries. Despite this, we're again able to slightly exceed the new money yield assumptions we have for our long-term care portfolio just as we did throughout 2015.
Given the recent volatility in oil prices, I'd like to give you an update on our energy holdings. As we told you last quarter, we believe our energy exposure is very manageable within our existing capital plans. The sharp increase in oil prices since we last talked has further strengthened our outlook for the portfolio. The portfolio ended the quarter in a net unrealized gain position of $18.9 million compared to a net unrealized loss position of $51.4 million at year-end 2015. The size of the portfolio also shrunk modestly.
During the first quarter, rating agencies undertook a comprehensive review of energy credits. As a result of that review, along with other portfolio management actions, our below investment grade energy exposure increased by $66 million. The impact of all the rating changes to our RBC ratios for the traditional U.S. insurance companies was only 2 RBC points. It's worth noting that the impact of rating changes to RBC ratio is heavily impacted by a company's ratio of C2 risk to C1 and C3 risk. Since we are more heavily weighted to C2 risk, the impact of these downgrades to our RBC ratio tends to be lower.
Net realized losses in the energy holdings from both gains and losses on sale as well as other than temporary impairment were $24 million pretax for the first quarter. These losses were partially offset by realized gains in the rest of the portfolio. We continue to review our energy holdings and examine those holdings through a number of stress scenarios.
Current oil prices are higher than our baseline scenario, and our experience in the first quarter was consistent and in some cases better than we expected. In summary, we continue to believe that the capital impact of our energy holdings are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans.
Moving to capital management. It was an active and very productive quarter for us. Our share repurchases totaled $100 million with most of that activity occurring while the stock was trading off in February, thereby enabling us to buy the shares at an average price of just over $27 per share.
As a result, we retired 1.5% of our shares, making a very productive use of our excess capital. In addition, as Rick highlighted, we announced the planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company, which we believe will provide us with a platform to begin to develop a substantial national dental and vision business over time, benefiting the growth prospects for both Unum US and Colonial Life.
This transaction won't close until the third quarter and is being financed in such a way that we expect to remain well within our capital ranges, while maintaining our share repurchase plans. Also on capital management, we typically see a reduction in our holding company cash in the first quarter. This year, we decided to maintain the dividends we take from our insurance companies in 2016 at approximately the same level as 2015, but we decided to adjust the quarterly pattern.
Therefore, we took a $179 million of dividends in the first quarter, about $35 million higher than the year-ago quarter. As a result, our holding company liquidity position remained stable at $478 million compared to $475 million at year-end 2015.
In addition, we've extended our $400 million credit facility by a new 5-year period to provide added flexibility. The higher statutory dividend, along with the growth in previously discussed downgrades, caused our risk-based capital ratio to slightly lower at approximately 390% compared to approximately 400% at year-end 2015.
We continue to target our risk-based capital ratio in a range of 375% to 400% for the year, and holding company liquidity is at least 1x our holding company cash coverage needs of just over $300 million this year.
Statutory after-tax operating earnings were quite strong for the first quarter at $184 million compared to $158 million in the year-ago quarter, a nice 16% increase.
Wrapping up, our expectations for the growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged from what we discussed when we reported the fourth quarter, which is a growth rate within a range of 3% to 6%. Overall, it was a very good start to the year, we're pleased with the operating results and feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility.
Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

I guess, I'd start by just saying we feel really good about the strength of the product portfolio and expanding product portfolio. The distribution relationship is rock-solid and the service proposition. So I think that's just important context. As you highlighted, we do have a tough comparison here in the first quarter. A year ago, sales were up in the high teens. But even given the tough comparison, if you sort of unpack the aggregate sales number here in first quarter of '16, there's some pretty encouraging trends. Within our supp and voluntary segment, we saw VB, as Jack highlighted, grow by 16% in the quarter. And actually large case VB had really good momentum as well. We had the $25 million sale last year to an existing client. To give you a sense, this year, our biggest VB sale was just a little under $4 million. So broad-based, I think, traction and success with voluntary. And also in the segment, recently issued IDI sales were up 36%. And that's a been a really good story for us and fits with our strategy of selling multiple lines into existing clients.
As you highlighted, the soft spot for us was new group insurance sales, and we felt that most acutely in what we would call the mid-market, which is sort of employers 250 to 2,000 lives. To give you a sense, proposal activity in that segment was actually up in the low double digits. So good traction in terms of taking good looks at opportunities, but our ability to close that business was definitely constrained by an increasingly aggressive underwriting environment out there. We saw that materialize a bit in the second half of last year, and it's definitely persisted here into the first quarter of 2016. We have seen this cycle many times. So we're going to maintain our discipline. We'll certainly look to write business where we can do so profitably, but we're going to have to, I think, keep a real close eye on it.
Group insurance, this is our smallest sales quarter of the year. So a lot of work to transpire between now and the end of the year, but the competitive market is one we're going to watch really closely on the new sales front. And I guess the final thing I'd say is renewal placement activity, another place where you'd see competition. We're really pleased with the ability to place rate increase due to the interest rate environment and persistency hanging in just a tick below 90%, earned premium growth up about 6%. So feel good in aggregate, but watching the new sales environment is going to be really important."

I would say the group disability loss ratio is going to move a point or 2 around that 80% to 82% range. There's a little bit of seasonality as we go through the summer months. I'd expect some of our paid incidence to pick up just a little bit, if prior year proves out. Over time, the improvement in the loss ratio that you're citing, a lot of that is us taking rate action in the book to account for interest rates. So as our net investment income is falling, we're making up with that through price levels which shows up in our loss ratio. So I would characterize it as a good, solid to slightly favorable risk quarter and within our targets looking forward."

One is a single life direct to the individual business and you'd have to engage the team at MetLife, but my sense is that's the business that they're taking a step back from. There remains an employee benefit, multi-life individual product, that's what's sold at the work site to typically mid- to high earners. And that's the business we characterize as recently issued. It has been a market that sort of been a slow growth market that ticked up a bit. And it's been a really good story for us here at Unum. I mentioned, sales were up about 36% in the first quarter, most of that coming off block growth opportunities. Often it's cross sold with our group insurance and voluntary lines, and we've got it to a place now where the top line is growing about 5%. So it's a good market for us. And I don't think that particular move that you mentioned with Met is going to have a big impact for us, but it remains a market that we're pretty excited about."

Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9%",715,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9% in the first half. Our operating trends have been very strong across the company., with solid levels of premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK, and Colonial Life, coupled with stable benefits experience and favorable expense management trends. 
I'm particularly pleased that we're achieving these strong results despite what has been a difficult business environment with historically low interest rates. The reason that we can deliver these consistent to improving results is, because we have a sound strategy and business plan in place. It is one that resonates well with our customers and the employee benefits marketplace, both on our exiting group solutions as well as the growing voluntary space. And it's our execution of the strategy that is generating strong financial outcomes. I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, but first I want to provide a few highlights on the second quarter. 
First, the premium growth that we're generating in our core operations remains very healthy at approximately 5% in each of our business lines. For the second quarter, premium income growth in Unum US was driven by strong persistency trends and our sales trends over this past several quarters. Total sales increased slightly in the second quarter with very strong performance in the voluntary and supplemental lines, offsetting a small decline in our employee benefit lines, where markets remain competitive. 
Unum U.K. premium growth benefited from the National Dental Plan acquisition from last year as well as growth in the Group Income Protection line. And finally, premium growth at Colonial Life was driven by the excellent sales trends we have seen over the past few years, which continued again this quarter with growth in new sales of 13%, bringing first half sales growth to just under 15%. 
Next, I'm very pleased we have maintained strong profit margins in our core business segments, while building this positive momentum in premium growth over the past several quarters. This shows the discipline we have bring to our markets and how we priced, underwrite and manage customer relationships in order to maintain the balance between producing topline growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins. 
These strong operating results have a very strong level of statuary earnings in capital, which provides a substantial financial flexibility. Our first half statuary openings earnings have been outstanding, increasing 29% year-over-year to $400 million or just over. This enables us to continually generate free cash flow, which we have been used -- which we have used to create shareholder value through steady, consistent share repurchases and annual dividend increases.  At the same time, we're able to capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities such as National Dental Plan in the U.K., and Starmount Life Insurance Company, which is also in the dental market, and we are able to capitalize them when they are available. 
So in summary, it's been a very strong first half of 2016 for the company. This performance is result of our steadfast focus on discipline execution of our business plan. This is reflected in many facets of our business, starting with our customers and includes how we underwrite in our prices business, how we manage clients to help people return to work, how we administer and enroll business and how we manage customer relationships. 
Operationally, we also continue to focus on disciplined expense management, which is evident in a favorable expense trends we have delivered in many of our business segments, which is also a net of the investments we are making in our businesses through such things customer facing technologies. When you combine this disciplined execution with our market positioning and growing footprint, we see a continuation of good profitable growth. 
And finally, I can't say enough about our people, who are responsible for this performance day-in, and day-out. We're committed to developing our talent, building over bench strength and ensuring our people continue to drive the changed necessary to remain the leader in the employee benefits marketplace. So those highlights are an excellent second quarter. I'll ask Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high level of overview of our second quarter results and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter. First, I want to highlight the composition of our asset tax",2219,"Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level of overview of our second quarter results and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter. First, I want to highlight the composition of our asset tax operating income per share growth of 11.2%, which was well balanced between after-tax operating income and capital management. 
Operating income grew 5.9% over the year-ago quarter. This quarter was one of the strongest and best balanced quarters we've seen. In addition, the benefit from our share repurchase activity reduced our average shares outstanding by 4.8%, compared to the year-ago share count. A key driver of our success this quarter was the performance of Unum US. 
Second quarter operating income was very strong at $227.2 million, an increase of 12% on the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth continued it's positive trends, increasing 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.1% in the second quarter compared to 71.2% in the year-ago quarter. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management was also contributed to operating results with the other expense ratio declining to 20.9% in the quarter, compared to 21.9% in the year-ago quarter. 
The profitability of our Unum US segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 15.1% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was $74.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 21.6% over last year. Premium income increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, but pressure on net income continues, driven primarily by a lower portfolio yields. 
The benefit ratio was quite positive at 80.0% for the second quarter, compared to 83.4% in the year-ago quarter, as we continue to see lower new claim incidents and favorable claim recovery trends in our group long-term disability line, along with shorter claim duration periods in our group disability line. 
Group Life and AD&D operating income improved to $56.9 million for the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 3.9% over the year-ago quarter, with the benefit ratio improved to 71.5% for the second quarter, compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter, it is by favorable Group Life wavier premium benefits. 
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $95.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.6% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remain favorable, increasing 6.7% in the quarter compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, overall results remain in line with our expectation, with favorable trends in the voluntary benefits line, offset by mildly elevated benefit ratios in the individual disability line. 
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 25.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 5.7% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and the growth in the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 70.1% for the second quarter, a slight improvement relative to the 70.7% in the year-ago quarter, as favorable risk experience in the disability line offset unfavorable expense in the life line.  Overall, profitability at the Unum UK segment remains quite strong with an operating ROE at 20.9% for the second quarter. 
It's too early to tell what the long-term impact that Brexit will have on our Unum UK operations. The low exchange rate will impact our results immediately in the third quarter. We do not expect to see much, if any impact to our risk results; however, if employment trends and wage inflation slowdown in the U.K., and interest rates remain underpressured, we could see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends.  We believe that's the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit board, but we will be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters. 
Colonial Life continued to generate strong steady results, with operating income of $77.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.6%, and the benefit ratio was 51.1% for the second quarter, compared to 50.4% for the year-ago quarter, due primarily to less favorable mortality experience in the life product line.  Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE up 17.4% for the quarter. 
In the second quarter, we competed our deck reviews for both our Unum US and Colonial Life businesses, with minimal impacts on second quarter results. 
Finally, for the Closed Block. Operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the exceptionally strong $36.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, we saw very favorable underlining experience. The increase in the adjusted loss ratio to 84.3% in the second quarter from the 83.6% in the year-ago quarter, includes a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the high level of bond calls and tenders during the second quarter of 2016.  Excluding this reduction and the discount rate, the interest adjusted loss ratio would have been slightly below 80%, one of our most favorable results in years. 
For the long-term care line, they interest adjusted loss ratio was 92.6% for the second quarter, compared to the unusually favorable 83.4% in the year-ago quarter. This swinging results demonstrates the volatility that this subject to on a quarterly basis and the importance of taking our longer-term view with the performance, which shows an interest adjusted loss ratio since our 4Q 2014 reserve review of 88.6%. The results in long-term this quarter were driven by an increase in new claim incidence and severity, brought on partly believe by the rate increase notifications that we delivered to policyholders recently. We expect that this is likely to continue in the near term and it's consistent with the claim activity behavior we've experienced in the past following rate increase notifications to policyholders.  As before, we expect these higher claim levels to remediate once we are through the rate increase notifications. 
I'm pleased that we continued to make good progress on achieving rate increases in our long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators, we're also seeing strong pickup of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reservers as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of derisking the portfolio. Since the future claims will be smaller on the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes in reserve-less function. 
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales increased 1.4% for the second quarter compared to a year ago. We continued to see competitive market particularly in the core market segment, where we continued to increase our rate to offset interest rate pressures. 
In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 3.4% with core market sales down 9.9%, while large case sales increased 12.8%, reflecting continued success our ongoing efforts to increase penetration within existing customers. The momentum and our supplements on voluntary segments remain very encouraging. Our individual disability sales increased 12.3%, compared to a year ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. 
In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales increased 14% with a good balance between core market and large case sales. Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. For the employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 90 -- 89.6%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our block to offset the impact of low interest rates and reduce discount rate assumptions that have been implemented in recent years. 
Our sales force does an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our in-force business, which is essential to our ability to grow, while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block.  Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.7%, was favorable to the prior year results as was individual disability persistency at 91.3%. 
Sales in the Unum UK continue to rebound, increasing 19.4% in local currency with favorable trends in the core market for group long-term disability and group life overall, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition. Persistency was favorable at 85.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 5.7% this quarter. 
Finally, sales trends at Colonial Life remain very strong, increasing 13.3% for the second quarter and 14.5% for the first half of the year. Growth continues to be well balanced between the commercial market sector and the public sector and between sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but remains in line with our expectations. As a result, premium growth is showing steady momentum, increasing 4.6% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments and as Rick highlighted earlier, the profit margins that we been able to sustain. 
Looking now at investment results. New money yields remain underpressure in the second quarter. However, I'm pleased that we're able again to exceed the new money yield assumption we have for our long-term care portfolio. We have exceeded our target of investing cash flows at 5% rate for every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. 
We remain well positioned with our Unum US long-term disability business from an interest rate perspective as our interest reserve margin remains very healthy. It's a great benefit to us as we navigate the interest rate that resulted from the Brexit referendum. It's too early to make a decision today on any future changes to the LTD discount rate for new claim but we remain satisfied that our -- with our margin at this time in a well tested ability to deliver the offsetting rate increases into the market should an adjustment be needed. 
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight that further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $433 million at the end of the second quarter, compared to a gain of $19 million a quarter ago. It's impressive that the gross unrealized loss on energy holdings has declined to $85  --  $89.5 million at the end of the second quarter, compared to $297.4 million at the end of the first quarter. 
Energy holdings in a loss position were trading at over 90% of book value at the end of the second quarter. I believe, this validates the investment decisions in credit evaluation process we followed for the past several years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management overall investment portfolio. 
Moving to capital management. It was another active quarter as we repurchased $100 million of our shares, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, roughly twice the level we target for holding cas coverage for 1 year. 
This cash position is net of the $350 million we are holding for the debt maturity on September 30 contributions in the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company. As a reminder, we issued $600 million in senior debt back in early May, in part to refinance this maturing date. 
Our risk based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance company remained at approximately 390%, well within our target range of 375 to 400 for this year. Statutory asset tax operating earnings were outstanding at $228.4 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $161.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 42%. This one of the best statutory quarters on record, reflecting the favorable risk experience across our primary business lines. 
For the first half of 2016, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $412.5 million, an increase of 29% over last year. 
Our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged with an expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. We now expect to be at the higher end of that range of the first half after-tax operating earnings per share growth has been a very healthy 9%. While we're not building that rate of growth into our expectations for the second half of the year, we remain very encouraged by our first-half trends. 
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our first half results. In fact, been remarkable given the environment. We have executed very well on many parts of our strategy, including delivering rate increases and exceeding new money yield for long-term care, generating strong persistency growth in our core business segments and maintaining pricing discipline and delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins. 
Given this progress, we enter the second half of the year highly confident in our ability to continue to create value in this difficult environment. Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

They pretty much come back now to where they were at pre-Brexit. We did see risk-free rate up as well, that hasn't come back well. And obviously, the thing your seeing in our results is the exchange rate dropping to around about a $1.32. And I think one of the things that if it stays there, you will see continued pressure because our average exchange rates we're using at the moment -- in the 140s, so that will come down if it at $1.32. What I would say, it's uncertain environment and it's new for to see whats going to happen to the economy. 
Looking to the U.K. If you take our investment portfolio, I mean, Jack's talked about this already, we're very well positioned -- financial stocks and feel very good about the investment portfolio and the robustness of that. 
And if you take the revenue, and we have exposure to particularly some of the big financial services firms, in talking to them though, very few have definitive plans about what they're going to do yet. Again, there are more cautious, I would say, and we saw a bit of that come through our premiums in the first half. And so therefore, they're not investing in recruiting people, perhaps taking -- have a cost of control on the benefits plans, but nothing material, I would say, yet coming through that would affect us. 
And to your questions on benefits. Actually, on the last recession, we didn't see a lot of impact on our benefit ratio. We saw something called presentism. People worried about their jobs and actually not going that was bit cyclical aspect for us. So our business model brings very robust. And so we're very pretty happy that we've got a good focus on the risk-free rise and what the impacts of that might be. The area that is more difficult to call is the new money rates risk fees dropped. Clearly, the 10-year bond is below 1% for U.K. And again like the U.S., we've gotten a proven track record of putting rate through will probably dampen growth a bit because not all our competitors are as disciplined as Unum is both in the U.S. and U.K., but we'll have to see how that works And really, as we go through the next few months and the government begins to set out it's position, we'll get a clear picture and be able to update you on the impacts as that becomes more clear.

Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9%",720,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9% in the first half. Our operating trends have been very strong across the company, with solid levels of premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, coupled with stable benefits experience and favorable expense management trends. 
I am particularly pleased that we're achieving these strong results despite what has been a difficult business environment with historically low interest rates. The reason that we can deliver these consistent to improving results is because we have a sound strategy and business plan in place. It is one that resonates well with our customers in the employee benefits marketplace, both on our existing group solutions as well as the growing voluntary space. And it's our execution of the strategy that is generating these strong financial outcomes. I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment, but first, I want to provide a few highlights on the second quarter. 
First, the premium growth we are generating in our core operations remains very healthy at approximately 5% in each of our business lines. For the second quarter, premium income growth in Unum US was driven by strong persistency trends and our sales trends over these past several quarters. Total sales increased slightly in the second quarter with very strong performance in the voluntary and supplemental lines, offsetting a small decline in our employee benefit lines, where markets remain competitive. Unum U.K. premium growth benefited from the National Dental Plan acquisition from last year as well as growth in the Group Income Protection line. And finally, premium growth at Colonial Life was driven by the excellent sales trends we have seen over the past few years, which continued again this quarter, with growth in new sales of 13%, bringing first half sales growth to just under 15%. 
Next, I'm very pleased we have maintained strong profit margins in our core business segments while building this positive momentum in premium growth over the past several quarters. This showed the discipline we are bringing to our markets in how we price, underwrite and manage customer relationships in order to maintain the balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins. 
These strong operating results drive a very strong level of statutory earnings in capital, which provides a substantial financial flexibility. Our first half statutory operating earnings have been outstanding, increasing 29% year-over-year to $400 million or just over. This enables us to continually generate free cash flow, which we have been used -- which we have used to create shareholder value through steady, consistent share repurchases and annual dividend increases.  At the same time, we're able to capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities such as National Dental Plan in the U.K., and Starmount Life Insurance Company, which is also in the dental market, and we are able to capitalize them when they are available. 
So in summary, it's been a very strong first half of 2016 for the company. This performance is a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This is reflected in many facets of our business, starting with our customers and includes how we underwrite in price business, how we manage claims to help people return to work, how we administer and enroll business and how we manage customer relationships. 
Operationally, we also continue to focus on disciplined expense management, which is evident in the favorable expense trends we have delivered in many of our business segments, which is also a net of the investment we are making in our businesses through such things as customer-facing technologies. When you combine this disciplined execution with our market positioning and growing footprint, we see a continuation of good profitable growth. 
And finally, I can't say enough about our people, who are responsible for this performance day-in and day-out. We're committed to developing our talent, building our bench strength and ensuring our people continue to drive the changes necessary to remain the leader in the employee benefits marketplace. 
So with those highlights on an excellent second quarter, I'll ask Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our second quarter results, and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter.

Rick provided a high-level overview of our second quarter results, and now I want provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter. 
First, I want to highlight the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 11.2%, which was well balanced between after-tax operating income growth and capital management.  Operating income grew 5.9% over the year-ago quarter. This quarter was one of the strongest and best balanced quarters we've seen. In addition, the benefit from our share repurchase activity reduced our average shares outstanding by 4.8% compared to the year-ago share count. 
A key driver of our success this quarter was the performance of Unum US. Second quarter operating income was very strong at $227.2 million, an increase of 12% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth continued it's positive trends, increasing 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.1% in the second quarter compared to 71.2% in the year-ago quarter. 
In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management was -- also contributed to operating results, with the other expense ratio declining to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.9% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of our Unum US segment remained very strong, with an operating ROE of 15.1% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was $74.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 21.6% over last year. Premium income increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, but pressure on net investment income continues, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. 
The benefit ratio was quite positive at 80.0% for the second quarter compared to 83.4% in the year-ago quarter, as we continue to see lower new claims incidents and favorable claim recovery trends in our group long-term disability line, along with shorter claim duration periods in our group short-term disability line. 
Group Life and AD&D operating income improved to $56.9 million for the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 3.9% over the year-ago quarter, with the benefit ratio improved to 71.5% for the second quarter compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter, aided by favorable Group Life waiver of premium benefits. 
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $95.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.6% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained favorable, increasing 6.7% in the quarter compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, overall results remain in line with our expectation, with favorable trends in the voluntary benefits line, offset by mildly elevated benefit ratios in the individual disability line. 
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 25.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 5.7% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and the growth of the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 70.1% for the second quarter, a slight improvement relative to the 70.7% in the year-ago quarter, as favorable risk experience in the disability line offsets some unfavorable experience in the life line.  Overall, profitability at the Unum UK segment remains quite strong, with an operating ROE at 20.9% for the second quarter. 
It's too early to tell what the long-term impact that Brexit will have on our Unum UK operations. The lower exchange rate will impact our results immediately in the third quarter. We do not expect to see much, if any, impact to our risk results; however, if employment trends and wage inflation slowdown in the U.K. and interest rates remain under pressure, we could see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends.  We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we will be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters. 
Colonial Life continued to generate strong steady results, with operating income of $77.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.6%, and the benefit ratio was 51.1% for the second quarter compared to 50.4% for the year-ago quarter, due primarily to less favorable mortality experience in the life product line.  Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins, with an operating ROE of 17.4% for the quarter. 
In the second quarter, we completed our DAC reviews for both our Unum US and Colonial Life businesses, with minimal impacts on second quarter results. 
Finally, for the Closed Block. Operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the exceptionally strong $36.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, we saw very favorable underlying experience. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84.3% in the second quarter from 83.6% in the year-ago quarter includes a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the high level of bond calls and bond tenders during the second quarter of 2016. Excluding this reduction and the discount rate, the interest adjusted loss ratio would have been slightly below 80%, one of our most favorable results in years. 
For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 92.6% for the second quarter compared to the unusually favorable 83.4% in the year-ago quarter. This swing in results demonstrates the volatility that this block is subject to on a quarterly basis and the importance of taking our longer-term view with the performance, which shows an interest adjusted loss ratio since our 4Q 2014 reserve review of 88.6%. 
The results in long-term this quarter were driven by an increase in new claim incidence and severity, brought on in part, we believe, by the rate increase notifications that we delivered to policyholders recently. We expect that this is likely to continue in the near term and is consistent with the claim activity behavior we've experienced in the past following rate increase notifications to policyholders.  As before, we expect these higher-claim levels to remediate once we are through the rate increase notifications. 
I'm pleased that we continued to make good progress on achieving rate increases in our inforce long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators, we're also seeing strong pickup of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of derisking the portfolio. Since future claims will be smaller under the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes in reserve assumptions. 
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales increased 1.4% for the second quarter compared to a year ago. We continued to see competitive market completions, particularly in the core market segment, where we continued to increase our rates to offset interest rate pressures. 
In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 3.4%, with core market sales down 9.9% while large case sales increased 12.8%, reflecting continued success in our ongoing efforts to increase penetration within existing customers. 
The momentum in our supplemental and voluntary segments remain very encouraging. Our individual disability sales increased 12.3% compared to a year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales increased 14%, with a good balance between core market and large case sales. 
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. For the employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 90 -- 89.6%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our inforce block to offset the impact of low interest rates and reduce discount rate assumptions that have been implemented in recent years. 
Our sales force does an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our inforce business, which is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block.  Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.7% was favorable to the prior year results as was individual disability persistency at 91.3%. 
Sales in the Unum UK continue to rebound, increasing 19.4% in local currency, with favorable trends in the core market for group long-term disability and group life overall, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition. Persistency was favorable at 85.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 5.7% this quarter. 
Finally, sales trends at Colonial Life remain very strong, increasing 13.3% for the second quarter and 14.5% for the first half of the year. Growth continues to be well balanced between the commercial market sector and the public sector and between sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but remains in line with our expectations. As a result, premium growth is showing steady momentum, increasing 4.6% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments and, as Rick highlighted earlier, the profit margins that we've been able to sustain. 
Looking now at investment results. New money yields remain under pressure in the second quarter. However, I'm pleased that we were able again to exceed the new money yield assumption we have for our long-term care portfolio. We have exceeded our target of investing cash flows at 5% rate for every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. 
We remain well positioned with our Unum US long-term disability business from an interest rate perspective as our interest reserve margin remains very healthy. It's a great benefit to us as we navigate the dip in interest rates that resulted from the Brexit referendum. It's too early to make a decision today on any future changes to the LTD discount rate for new claim incurrals, but we remain satisfied that our -- with our margin at this time in a well-tested and proven ability to deliver the offsetting rate increases into the market, should an adjustment be needed. 
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $433 million at the end of the second quarter compared to a gain of $19 million a quarter ago. It's impressive that the gross unrealized loss on energy holdings has declined to $85  --  $89.5 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $297.4 million at the end of the first quarter. 
Energy holdings in a loss position were trading at over 90% of book value at the end of the second quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions in credit evaluation process we followed for the past several years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio. 
Moving to capital management. It was another active quarter as we repurchased $100 million of our shares, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, roughly twice the level we target for holding company cash coverage needs for 1 year. 
This cash position is net of the $350 million we are holding for the debt maturity on September 30 for contributions in the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company. As a reminder, we issued $600 million in senior debt back in early May, in part, to refinance this maturing debt. 
Our risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies remained at approximately 390%, well within our target range of 375% to 400% for this year. Statutory asset tax operating earnings were outstanding at $228.4 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $161.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 42%. This one is the best statutory quarters on record, reflecting the favorable risk experience across our primary business lines. 
For the first half of 2016, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $412.5 million, an increase of 29% over last year. Our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged, with an expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. We now expect to be at the higher end of that range as the first half after-tax operating earnings per share growth has been a very healthy 9%. While we're not building that rate of growth into our expectations for the second half of the year, we remain very encouraged by our first half trends. 
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our first half results. In fact, I'd stated they're remarkable given the environment. We have executed very well on many parts of our strategy, including delivering rate increases and exceeding new money yield targets for long-term care, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments and maintaining pricing discipline and delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins. 
Given this progress, we enter the second half of the year highly confident in our ability to continue to create value in this difficult environment. Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

So we're happy to attend those hearings. We're really engaged in them. We have a very good story about where our block is, the reasons we're chasing that we're pursuing rate increases, the justification for them. I think that the fact that we're not kind of restore original pricing profitability into the block, that we're pursuing a sustainability strategy resonates well. And the lending spot option that gives people an option to maintain their current premium level while continuing to maintain extremely valuable benefits resonates well.

They pretty much come back now to where they were pre-Brexit. So we did see the risk-free rates are up as well. That hasn't come back yet. And obviously, the thing you're seeing in our results is the exchange rate dropping to around about a $1.32. And I think one of the things that, if it stays there, you will see is a continued pressure, because our average exchange rate we're using at the moment is right in the $1.40s. So that would come down if it sticks at $1.32. What I would say, it's an uncertain environment, and it's new for remainers, leavers, [indiscernible] or waiters to see what's going to happen to the economy. Looking to the U.K., if you take our investment portfolio, I mean, Jack has talked about this already, we're very well positioned -- defensive position to financial stocks and feel very good about the investment portfolio and the robustness of that. And if you take revenue, and we have got exposure to, particularly, some of the big financial services firms. In talking to them though, very few have definitive plans about what they're going to do yet. Again, there are more cautious, I would say, and we saw a bit of that come through our premiums in the first half. And so therefore, they're not investing in recruiting people, perhaps to taking -- have a more of an eye for cost control on their benefits plans, but nothing material, I would say, yet coming through that would affect us. And to your question on benefits. Actually, in the last recession, we didn't see a lot of impact on our benefit ratio. We saw something called presentism. People worried about their jobs and actually not going off field. So that was, I mean, a bit of a countercyclical aspect for us. So our business model remains very robust. And so we're pretty happy that we've got a good focus on the risk-free rise and what the impacts of that might be. The area that is more difficult to call is the new money rates. As I've said, risk-free has dropped. Clearly, the 10-year bond is below 1% for U.K. And again, like the U.S., we've got a proven track record of putting rate through. Clearly, that will probably dampen growth a bit, because not all of our competitors are as disciplined as Unum is, both in the U.S. and U.K. But we'll have to see how that works first. And really, as we go through the next few months and the government begins to set out its position, we'll get a clearer picture and be able to update you on the impacts as that becomes more clear. I'll just finished that we got a strong business model that's well positioned to manage Brexit. That was all I was going to say, Rick."

Oftentimes, an old person can go into an assisted living facility and not even realize that they have the coverage, even though they're still paying for it. And that rate increase comes out as a reminder, and that reminder sparks people to apply for the benefits. You get some late applications with that, people who are already -- have been in a facility for a while, who are looking for back payments. So that affects the loss ratio. And it just becomes an increase. We actually looked over the past couple of quarters at the incidence rate on people who've received a notification versus the incidence rate on people who are -- who will be receiving them, but haven't received them yet. And there's a 10% to 15% difference between those 2, with the ones being notified, being 10% to 15% higher. It impacts severity of claims as well because that lending -- that notification is focused on people with inflation writers, and so they tend to have higher benefits. We've seen it in the past.

Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9%",721,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9% in the first half. Our operating trends have been very strong across the company, with solid levels of premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, coupled with stable benefits experience and favorable expense management trends. 
I am particularly pleased that we're achieving these strong results despite what has been a difficult business environment with historically low interest rates. The reason that we can deliver these consistent to improving results is because we have a sound strategy and business plan in place. It is one that resonates well with our customers in the employee benefits marketplace, both on our existing group solutions as well as the growing voluntary space. And it's our execution of the strategy that is generating these strong financial outcomes. I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment, but first, I want to provide a few highlights on the second quarter. 
First, the premium growth we are generating in our core operations remains very healthy at approximately 5% in each of our business lines. For the second quarter, premium income growth in Unum US was driven by strong persistency trends and our sales trends over the past several quarters. Total sales increased slightly in the second quarter with very strong performance in the voluntary and supplemental lines, offsetting a small decline in our employee benefit lines, where markets remain competitive. Unum U.K. premium growth benefited from the National Dental Plan acquisition from last year as well as growth in the Group Income Protection line. And finally, premium growth at Colonial Life was driven by the excellent sales trends we have seen over the past few years, which continued again this quarter, with growth in new sales of 13%, bringing first half sales growth to just under 15%. 
Next, I'm very pleased that we have maintained strong profit margins in our core business segments while building this positive momentum in premium growth over the past several quarters. This shows the discipline we are bringing to our markets in how we price, underwrite and manage customer relationships in order to maintain a balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins. 
These strong operating results drive a very strong level of statutory earnings in capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. Our first half statutory operating earnings have been outstanding, increasing 29% year-over-year to $400 million or just over. This enables us to continually generate free cash flow, which we have been used -- which we have used to create shareholder value through steady, consistent share repurchases and annual dividend increases. At the same time, we're able to capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities such as National Dental Plan in the U.K., and Starmount Life Insurance Company, which is also in the dental market, and we are able to capitalize on them when they are available. 
So in summary, it's been a very strong first half of 2016 for the company. This performance is a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This is reflected in many facets of our business, starting with our customers and includes how we underwrite and price business, how we manage claims to help people return to work, how we administer and enroll business and how we manage customer relationships. 
Operationally, we also continue to focus on disciplined expense management, which is evident in the favorable expense trends we have delivered in many of our business segments, which is also net of the investment we are making in our businesses through such things as customer-facing technologies. When you combine this disciplined execution with our market positioning and growing footprint, we see a continuation of good, profitable growth. 
And finally, I can't say enough about our people, who are responsible for this performance day-in and day-out. We're committed to developing our talent, building our bench strength and ensuring our people continue to drive the changes necessary to remain the leader in the employee benefits marketplace. 
So with those highlights on an excellent second quarter, I'll ask Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our second quarter results, and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter. 
First, I want to highlight the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 11.2%, which was well balanced between after-tax operating income growth and capital management. Operating income grew 5.9% over the year-ago quarter. This quarter was one of the strongest and best balanced quarters we've seen. In addition, the benefit from our share repurchase activity reduced our average shares outstanding by 4.8% compared to the year-ago share count. 
A key driver of our success this quarter was the performance of Unum US. Second quarter operating income was very strong at $227.2 million, an increase of 12% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth continued its positive trend, increasing 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.1% in the second quarter compared to 71.2% in the year-ago quarter. 
In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management was -- also contributed to operating results, with the other expense ratio declining to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.9% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of our Unum US segment remained very strong, with an operating ROE of 15.1% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was $74.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 21.6% over last year. Premium income increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, but pressure on net investment income continues, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. 
The benefit ratio was quite positive at 80.0% for the second quarter compared to 83.4% in the year-ago quarter, as we continue to see lower new claims incidence and favorable claim recovery trends in our group long-term disability line, along with shorter claim duration periods in our group short-term disability line. 
Group Life and AD&D operating income improved to $56.9 million for the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 3.9% over the year-ago quarter, with the benefit ratio improved to 71.5% for the second quarter compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter, aided by favorable Group Life waiver of premium benefits. 
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $95.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.6% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained favorable, increasing 6.7% in the quarter compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, overall results remain in line with our expectation, with favorable trends in the voluntary benefits line, offset by mildly elevated benefit ratios in the individual disability line. 
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 25.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 5.7% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and the growth of the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 70.1% for the second quarter, a slight improvement relative to the 70.7% in the year-ago quarter, as favorable risk experience in the disability line offset some unfavorable experience in the life line. Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite strong, with an operating ROE of 20.9% for the second quarter. 
It's too early to tell what the long-term impact of Brexit will have on our Unum UK operations. The lower exchange rate will impact our results immediately in the third quarter. We do not expect to see much, if any, impact to our risk results; however, if employment trends and wage inflation slow down in the U.K. and interest rates remain under pressure, we could see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends. We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we will be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters. 
Colonial Life continued to generate strong steady results, with operating income of $77.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.6%, and the benefit ratio was 51.1% for the second quarter compared to 50.4% for the year-ago quarter, due primarily to less favorable mortality experience in the life product line. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins, with an operating ROE of 17.4% for the quarter. 
In the second quarter, we completed our DAC reviews for both our Unum US and Colonial Life businesses, with minimal impacts on second quarter results. 
Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the exceptionally strong $36.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, we saw very favorable underlying experience. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84.3% in the second quarter from 83.6% in the year-ago quarter includes a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the high level of bond calls and bond tenders during the second quarter of 2016. Excluding this reduction in the discount rate, the interest adjusted loss ratio would have been slightly below 80%, one of our most favorable results in years. 
For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 92.6% for the second quarter compared to the unusually favorable 83.4% in the year-ago quarter. This swing in results demonstrates the volatility that this block is subject to on a quarterly basis and the importance of taking a longer-term view of the performance, which shows an interest adjusted loss ratio since our 4Q 2014 reserve review of 88.6%. 
The results in long-term this quarter were driven by an increase in new claim incidence and severity, brought on in part, we believe, by the rate increase notifications that we delivered to policyholders recently. We expect that this is likely to continue in the near term and is consistent with the claim activity behavior we've experienced in the past following rate increase notifications to policyholders. As before, we expect these higher claim levels to remediate once we are through the rate increase notifications. 
I'm pleased that we continue to make good progress on achieving rate increases in our inforce long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators, we're also seeing strong pickup of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of derisking the portfolio. Since future claims will be smaller under the landing spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes in reserve assumptions. 
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales increased 1.4% for the second quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions, particularly in the core market segment, where we continue to increase our rates to offset interest rate pressures. 
In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 3.4%, with core market sales down 9.9% while large case sales increased 12.8%, reflecting continued success in our ongoing efforts to increase penetration within existing customers. 
The momentum in our supplemental and voluntary segments remain very encouraging. Our individual disability sales increased 12.3% compared to a year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales increased 14%, with a good balance between core market and large case sales. 
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. For the employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 90 -- 89.6%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our inforce block to offset the impact of low interest rates and reduce discount rate assumptions that have been implemented in recent years. 
Our sales force does an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our inforce business, which is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.7% was favorable to the prior year results, as was individual disability persistency at 91.3%. 
Sales in Unum UK continue to rebound, increasing 19.4% in local currency, with favorable trends in the core market for group long-term disability and group life overall, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition. Persistency was favorable at 85.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 5.7% this quarter. 
Finally, sales trends at Colonial Life remain very strong, increasing 13.3% for the second quarter and 14.5% for the first half of the year. Growth continues to be well balanced between the commercial market sector and the public sector and between sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter but remains in line with our expectations. As a result, premium growth is showing steady momentum, increasing 4.6% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments and, as Rick highlighted earlier, the profit margins that we've been able to sustain. 
Looking now at investment results. New money yields remained under pressure in the second quarter. However, I'm pleased that we were able again to exceed the new money yield assumption we have for our long-term care portfolio. We have exceeded our target of investing cash flows at 5% rate for every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. 
We remain well positioned with our Unum US long-term disability business from an interest rate perspective as our interest reserve margin remains very healthy. It's a great benefit to us as we navigate the dip in interest rates that resulted from the Brexit referendum. It's too early to make a decision today on any future changes to the LTD discount rate for new claim incurrals, but we remain satisfied that our -- with our margin at this time in a well-tested and proven ability to deliver the offsetting rate increases into the market, should an adjustment be needed. 
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $433 million at the end of the second quarter compared to a gain of $19 million a quarter ago. It's impressive that the gross unrealized loss on energy holdings has declined to $85 -- $89.5 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $297.4 million at the end of the first quarter. 
Energy holdings in a loss position were trading at over 90% of book value at the end of the second quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions and credit evaluation process we followed for the past several years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio. 
Moving to capital management. It was another active quarter as we repurchased $100 million of our shares, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, roughly twice the level we target for holding company cash coverage needs for 1 year. 
This cash position is net of the $350 million we are holding for the debt maturity on September 30, subsidiary contributions and the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company. As a reminder, we issued $600 million in senior debt back in early May, in part to refinance this maturing debt. 
Our risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies remained at approximately 390%, well within our target range of 375% to 400% for this year. Statutory after-tax operating earnings were outstanding at $228.4 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $161.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 42%. This is one of the best statutory quarters on record, reflecting the favorable risk experience across our primary business lines. 
For the first half of 2016, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $412.5 million, an increase of 29% over last year. Our outlook for growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged, with an expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. We now expect to be at the higher end of that range as our first half after-tax operating earnings per share growth has been a very healthy 9%. While we're not building that rate of growth into our expectations for the second half of the year, we remain very encouraged by our first half trends. 
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our first half results. In fact, I'd say they've been remarkable given the environment. We have executed very well on many parts of our strategy, including delivering rate increases and exceeding new money yield targets for long-term care, generating strong persistency and growth in our core business segments and maintaining pricing discipline and delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins. 
Given this progress, we enter the second half of the year highly confident in our ability to continue to create value in this difficult environment. Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

The 30-year, you get -- still have a reasonably steep yield curve. There's a 70 -- there's been a 70 to 80 basis point pickup in the 30-year. There's also a credit curve. And so the credit spreads at the 30-year are significantly higher than credit spreads at the 10-year. The Barclays Index over the past 6 quarters, where a BBB 30-year issuance has been well above 5% historically. We also use some other risk classes -- asset classes, whether it's private placements or other things to help boost that yield. So largely, it's the fact that the longer end of the curve has maintained decent margins."

They pretty much come back now to where they were pre-Brexit. We did see the risk-free rate drop as well. That hasn't come back yet. And obviously, the thing you're seeing in our results is the exchange rate dropping to around about $1.32. I think one of the things that, if it stays there, you will see is a continued pressure, because our average exchange rate we're using at the moment is right in the $1.40s. So that would come down if it sticks at $1.32. What I would say, it's an uncertain environment, and with move for remainers, leavers to now we're waiters to see what's going to happen to the economy. Looking to the U.K., if you take our investment portfolio, I mean, Jack has talked about this already, we're very well positioned -- defensively positioned to financial stocks and feel very good about the investment portfolio and the robustness of that. If you take revenue, we have got exposure to, particularly, some of the big financial services firms. In talking to them, though, very few have definitive plans about what they're going to do yet. Again, they're more cautious, I would say, and we saw a bit of that come through our premiums in the first half. And so therefore, they're not investing in recruiting people, perhaps they're taking it -- have a more of an eye for cost control on their benefits plans, but nothing material, I would say, yet coming through that would affect us. And to your question on benefits. Actually, in the last recession, we didn't see a lot of impact on our benefit ratio. We saw something called presenteeism. People worried about their jobs and actually not going off ill. So that was a bit of a countercyclical aspect for us. So our business model remains very robust. And so we're pretty happy that we've got a good focus on the risk-free rise and what the impacts of that might be. The area that is more difficult to call is the new money rates. As I've said, risk-free has dropped. Clearly, the 10-year bond is below 1% for the U.K. And again, like the U.S., we've got a proven track record of putting rate through. Clearly, that will probably dampen growth a bit, because not all of our competitors are as disciplined as Unum is, both in the U.S. and the U.K. But we'll have to see how that works out. And really, as we go through the next few months and the government begins to set out its position, we'll get a clearer picture and be able to update you on the impacts as that becomes more clear. I'll just finish that we got a strong business model that's well positioned to manage Brexit. That was all I was going to say, Rick."

And that rate increase comes out as a reminder, and that reminder sparks people to apply for the benefits. You get some late applications with that, people who are already -- have been in a facility for a while who are looking for back payments. So that affects the loss ratio. And it just becomes an increase. We actually looked over the past couple of quarters at the incidence rate on people who've received a notification versus the incidence rates on people who are -- who will be receiving them but haven't received them yet. And there's a 10% to 15% difference between those 2, with the ones being notified being 10% to 15% higher. It impacts severity of claims as well because that lending -- that notification is focused on people with inflation riders, and so they tend to have higher benefits. We've seen it in the past.

166762,369490024,1018112,"Unum Group, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Unum Group","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9%",721,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were excellent, with operating income per share of $0.99. This is an increase of 11% over last year. Together with our strong first quarter results, operating income per share grew 9% in the first half. Our operating trends have been very strong across the company, with solid levels of premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, coupled with stable benefits experience and favorable expense management trends. 
I am particularly pleased that we're achieving these strong results despite what has been a difficult business environment with historically low interest rates. The reason that we can deliver these consistent to improving results is because we have a sound strategy and business plan in place. It is one that resonates well with our customers in the employee benefits marketplace, both on our existing group solutions as well as the growing voluntary space. And it's our execution of the strategy that is generating these strong financial outcomes. I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment, but first, I want to provide a few highlights on the second quarter. 
First, the premium growth we are generating in our core operations remains very healthy at approximately 5% in each of our business lines. For the second quarter, premium income growth in Unum US was driven by strong persistency trends and our sales trends over the past several quarters. Total sales increased slightly in the second quarter with very strong performance in the voluntary and supplemental lines, offsetting a small decline in our employee benefit lines, where markets remain competitive. Unum U.K. premium growth benefited from the National Dental Plan acquisition from last year as well as growth in the Group Income Protection line. And finally, premium growth at Colonial Life was driven by the excellent sales trends we have seen over the past few years, which continued again this quarter, with growth in new sales of 13%, bringing first half sales growth to just under 15%. 
Next, I'm very pleased that we have maintained strong profit margins in our core business segments while building this positive momentum in premium growth over the past several quarters. This shows the discipline we are bringing to our markets in how we price, underwrite and manage customer relationships in order to maintain a balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins. 
These strong operating results drive a very strong level of statutory earnings in capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. Our first half statutory operating earnings have been outstanding, increasing 29% year-over-year to $400 million or just over. This enables us to continually generate free cash flow, which we have been used -- which we have used to create shareholder value through steady, consistent share repurchases and annual dividend increases. At the same time, we're able to capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities such as National Dental Plan in the U.K., and Starmount Life Insurance Company, which is also in the dental market, and we are able to capitalize on them when they are available. 
So in summary, it's been a very strong first half of 2016 for the company. This performance is a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This is reflected in many facets of our business, starting with our customers and includes how we underwrite and price business, how we manage claims to help people return to work, how we administer and enroll business and how we manage customer relationships. 
Operationally, we also continue to focus on disciplined expense management, which is evident in the favorable expense trends we have delivered in many of our business segments, which is also net of the investment we are making in our businesses through such things as customer-facing technologies. When you combine this disciplined execution with our market positioning and growing footprint, we see a continuation of good, profitable growth. 
And finally, I can't say enough about our people, who are responsible for this performance day-in and day-out. We're committed to developing our talent, building our bench strength and ensuring our people continue to drive the changes necessary to remain the leader in the employee benefits marketplace. 
So with those highlights on an excellent second quarter, I'll ask Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high-level overview of our second quarter results, and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the trends we saw in the quarter. 
First, I want to highlight the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 11.2%, which was well balanced between after-tax operating income growth and capital management. Operating income grew 5.9% over the year-ago quarter. This quarter was one of the strongest and best balanced quarters we've seen. In addition, the benefit from our share repurchase activity reduced our average shares outstanding by 4.8% compared to the year-ago share count. 
A key driver of our success this quarter was the performance of Unum US. Second quarter operating income was very strong at $227.2 million, an increase of 12% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth continued its positive trend, increasing 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.1% in the second quarter compared to 71.2% in the year-ago quarter. 
In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management was -- also contributed to operating results, with the other expense ratio declining to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.9% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of our Unum US segment remained very strong, with an operating ROE of 15.1% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was $74.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 21.6% over last year. Premium income increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, but pressure on net investment income continues, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. 
The benefit ratio was quite positive at 80.0% for the second quarter compared to 83.4% in the year-ago quarter, as we continue to see lower new claims incidence and favorable claim recovery trends in our group long-term disability line, along with shorter claim duration periods in our group short-term disability line. 
Group Life and AD&D operating income improved to $56.9 million for the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 3.9% over the year-ago quarter, with the benefit ratio improved to 71.5% for the second quarter compared to 73.1% in the year-ago quarter, aided by favorable Group Life waiver of premium benefits. 
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $95.9 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.6% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained favorable, increasing 6.7% in the quarter compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, overall results remain in line with our expectation, with favorable trends in the voluntary benefits line, offset by mildly elevated benefit ratios in the individual disability line. 
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 25.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 5.7% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and the growth of the group disability line. The benefit ratio was 70.1% for the second quarter, a slight improvement relative to the 70.7% in the year-ago quarter, as favorable risk experience in the disability line offset some unfavorable experience in the life line. Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite strong, with an operating ROE of 20.9% for the second quarter. 
It's too early to tell what the long-term impact of Brexit will have on our Unum UK operations. The lower exchange rate will impact our results immediately in the third quarter. We do not expect to see much, if any, impact to our risk results; however, if employment trends and wage inflation slow down in the U.K. and interest rates remain under pressure, we could see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends. We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we will be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters. 
Colonial Life continued to generate strong steady results, with operating income of $77.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.6%, and the benefit ratio was 51.1% for the second quarter compared to 50.4% for the year-ago quarter, due primarily to less favorable mortality experience in the life product line. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins, with an operating ROE of 17.4% for the quarter. 
In the second quarter, we completed our DAC reviews for both our Unum US and Colonial Life businesses, with minimal impacts on second quarter results. 
Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the exceptionally strong $36.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, we saw very favorable underlying experience. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84.3% in the second quarter from 83.6% in the year-ago quarter includes a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the high level of bond calls and bond tenders during the second quarter of 2016. Excluding this reduction in the discount rate, the interest adjusted loss ratio would have been slightly below 80%, one of our most favorable results in years. 
For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 92.6% for the second quarter compared to the unusually favorable 83.4% in the year-ago quarter. This swing in results demonstrates the volatility that this block is subject to on a quarterly basis and the importance of taking a longer-term view of the performance, which shows an interest adjusted loss ratio since our 4Q 2014 reserve review of 88.6%. 
The results in long-term this quarter were driven by an increase in new claim incidence and severity, brought on in part, we believe, by the rate increase notifications that we delivered to policyholders recently. We expect that this is likely to continue in the near term and is consistent with the claim activity behavior we've experienced in the past following rate increase notifications to policyholders. As before, we expect these higher claim levels to remediate once we are through the rate increase notifications. 
I'm pleased that we continue to make good progress on achieving rate increases in our inforce long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators, we're also seeing strong pickup of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of derisking the portfolio. Since future claims will be smaller under the landing spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes in reserve assumptions. 
I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales increased 1.4% for the second quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions, particularly in the core market segment, where we continue to increase our rates to offset interest rate pressures. 
In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 3.4%, with core market sales down 9.9% while large case sales increased 12.8%, reflecting continued success in our ongoing efforts to increase penetration within existing customers. 
The momentum in our supplemental and voluntary segments remain very encouraging. Our individual disability sales increased 12.3% compared to a year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales increased 14%, with a good balance between core market and large case sales. 
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. For the employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 90 -- 89.6%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our inforce block to offset the impact of low interest rates and reduce discount rate assumptions that have been implemented in recent years. 
Our sales force does an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our inforce business, which is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.7% was favorable to the prior year results, as was individual disability persistency at 91.3%. 
Sales in Unum UK continue to rebound, increasing 19.4% in local currency, with favorable trends in the core market for group long-term disability and group life overall, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition. Persistency was favorable at 85.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 5.7% this quarter. 
Finally, sales trends at Colonial Life remain very strong, increasing 13.3% for the second quarter and 14.5% for the first half of the year. Growth continues to be well balanced between the commercial market sector and the public sector and between sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter but remains in line with our expectations. As a result, premium growth is showing steady momentum, increasing 4.6% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments and, as Rick highlighted earlier, the profit margins that we've been able to sustain. 
Looking now at investment results. New money yields remained under pressure in the second quarter. However, I'm pleased that we were able again to exceed the new money yield assumption we have for our long-term care portfolio. We have exceeded our target of investing cash flows at 5% rate for every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. 
We remain well positioned with our Unum US long-term disability business from an interest rate perspective as our interest reserve margin remains very healthy. It's a great benefit to us as we navigate the dip in interest rates that resulted from the Brexit referendum. It's too early to make a decision today on any future changes to the LTD discount rate for new claim incurrals, but we remain satisfied that our -- with our margin at this time in a well-tested and proven ability to deliver the offsetting rate increases into the market, should an adjustment be needed. 
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $433 million at the end of the second quarter compared to a gain of $19 million a quarter ago. It's impressive that the gross unrealized loss on energy holdings has declined to $85 -- $89.5 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $297.4 million at the end of the first quarter. 
Energy holdings in a loss position were trading at over 90% of book value at the end of the second quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions and credit evaluation process we followed for the past several years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio. 
Moving to capital management. It was another active quarter as we repurchased $100 million of our shares, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, roughly twice the level we target for holding company cash coverage needs for 1 year. 
This cash position is net of the $350 million we are holding for the debt maturity on September 30, subsidiary contributions and the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company. As a reminder, we issued $600 million in senior debt back in early May, in part to refinance this maturing debt. 
Our risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies remained at approximately 390%, well within our target range of 375% to 400% for this year. Statutory after-tax operating earnings were outstanding at $228.4 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $161.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 42%. This is one of the best statutory quarters on record, reflecting the favorable risk experience across our primary business lines. 
For the first half of 2016, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $412.5 million, an increase of 29% over last year. Our outlook for growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged, with an expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. We now expect to be at the higher end of that range as our first half after-tax operating earnings per share growth has been a very healthy 9%. While we're not building that rate of growth into our expectations for the second half of the year, we remain very encouraged by our first half trends. 
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our first half results. In fact, I'd say they've been remarkable given the environment. We have executed very well on many parts of our strategy, including delivering rate increases and exceeding new money yield targets for long-term care, generating strong persistency and growth in our core business segments and maintaining pricing discipline and delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins. 
Given this progress, we enter the second half of the year highly confident in our ability to continue to create value in this difficult environment. Now I'll turn the call back to Rick."

In the scheme of things, that's not terribly material if it's spread out over 3 years, given the 40 years that the rest of it's going to run.

They pretty much come back now to where they were pre-Brexit. We did see the risk-free rate drop as well. That hasn't come back yet. And obviously, the thing you're seeing in our results is the exchange rate dropping to around about $1.32. I think one of the things that, if it stays there, you will see is a continued pressure, because our average exchange rate we're using at the moment is right in the $1.40s. So that would come down if it sticks at $1.32. What I would say, it's an uncertain environment, and with move for remainers, leavers to now we're waiters to see what's going to happen to the economy. Looking to the U.K., if you take our investment portfolio, I mean, Jack has talked about this already, we're very well positioned -- defensively positioned to financial stocks and feel very good about the investment portfolio and the robustness of that. If you take revenue, we have got exposure to, particularly, some of the big financial services firms. In talking to them, though, very few have definitive plans about what they're going to do yet. Again, they're more cautious, I would say, and we saw a bit of that come through our premiums in the first half. And so therefore, they're not investing in recruiting people, perhaps they're taking it -- have a more of an eye for cost control on their benefits plans, but nothing material, I would say, yet coming through that would affect us. And to your question on benefits. Actually, in the last recession, we didn't see a lot of impact on our benefit ratio. We saw something called presenteeism. People worried about their jobs and actually not going off ill. So that was a bit of a countercyclical aspect for us. So our business model remains very robust. And so we're pretty happy that we've got a good focus on the risk-free rise and what the impacts of that might be. The area that is more difficult to call is the new money rates. As I've said, risk-free has dropped. Clearly, the 10-year bond is below 1% for the U.K. And again, like the U.S., we've got a proven track record of putting rate through. Clearly, that will probably dampen growth a bit, because not all of our competitors are as disciplined as Unum is, both in the U.S. and the U.K. But we'll have to see how that works out. And really, as we go through the next few months and the government begins to set out its position, we'll get a clearer picture and be able to update you on the impacts as that becomes more clear. I'll just finish that we got a strong business model that's well positioned to manage Brexit. That was all I was going to say, Rick."

You get some late applications with that, people who are already -- have been in a facility for a while who are looking for back payments. So that affects the loss ratio. And it just becomes an increase. We actually looked over the past couple of quarters at the incidence rate on people who've received a notification versus the incidence rates on people who are -- who will be receiving them but haven't received them yet. And there's a 10% to 15% difference between those 2, with the ones being notified being 10% to 15% higher.

So if you pay the rate increase, your benefits continue to grow at 5% compound annual rate. So those who paid the rate increase have a bigger benefit bucket out there, and that additional premium pays for that benefit bucket.

As you realize fluctuations, whether it's interest rate fluctuations or underlying experience fluctuations, they don't affect premiums, they affect the benefits much more severely. And so by having a smaller pool out there, you're less sensitive to interest rates or mortality fluctuations."

The third quarter was another excellent one for Unum with after-tax, operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first 9 months of 2016, after-tax operating income per share has also increased close to 9%. This performance exceeds the upper end of our outlook range for the year of 3% to 6% growth, and has driven in large part by solid premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, along with very consistent benefits experience.
I'm very encouraged that we are delivering these strong results despite today's difficult business environment, with historically low interest rates and more recently, the sharp decline in the value of the British pound. The reason we're delivering these results begins the leadership position we've established in the employee and voluntary benefits marketplace over many years. These markets offer good opportunities for growth over the the long term. And we believe that our long-standing and focused commitment to serving our customers and advisers sets us apart from the competition. 
Our industry-leading expertise and our disciplined approach to the fundamental operations of our business have enabled us to grow our business with a high level of consistency and profitability. We'll cover these strategic points with you in greater detail at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December.
This morning, we'll focus on the strong financial results we have achieved in the third quarter as a result of the execution of this strategy. So now let me move to provide a few highlights on the quarter. 
First, the premium growth we're generating in our core operations remains healthy at approximately 4%. This trend continues to be driven by strong persistency levels in all of our core business lines and the volume of sales we've been generating over the last several years. While new sales trends are currently challenging in the Unum US markets due to competitive pricing conditions, we continue to see excellent sales trends at Colonial Life and experience a strong level of sales growth at Unum UK this year. Specifically, Colonial Life sales grew by 9.3% this quarter and 12.7% for the year-to-date.
Next, I continue to be very pleased with a strong profit margins we are consistently generating in our core business segments. This demonstrates the discipline we employ in all aspects of our business, including the pricing and underwriting of new business and the management of our in-force business relationships. All of this helps to provide a good balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins.
From a capital perspective, these strong operating results have continued to produce a strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which is the lifeblood of our financial flexibility. The third quarter was another excellent quarter for statutory earnings, which increased 13% and now exceed $800 million for the trailing 4 quarters.  This capital generation enables our capital deployment strategy, which starts with the opportunity to grow our business, both through the organic growth we're generating and the ability to capitalize upon attractive acquisition opportunities. It also has resulted in delivering steady repurchases of our shares and annual dividend increases.
On the acquisition side, we closed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company during the third quarter, providing the platform to grow what we believe will be a substantial Dental business over time. Dental is a good fit because it is a volume product that customers value. It is sold often at the workplace and as a voluntary product, it fits well in our existing product portfolio and distribution channel.
Another indicator of performance is the growth we have seen in book value per share, which in the third quarter is $40.33, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Book value excluding AOCI also increased 9.2% year-over-year to $38.39 at quarter end.
So in summary, it's been a very strong first 3 quarters of 2016. As I said earlier, I believe the success is largely a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This execution has multiple facets from underwriting and pricing to paying claims, to helping people return to work, all the while serving our customers very well. The combination of both operating and markets to provide good opportunities for growth and disciplined execution of our strategy leaves us very well positioned to deliver great value to our shareholders in the future.
So with those highlights on an excellent third quarter, I'd ask Jack to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results, now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter.

Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results, now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter. 
First, I'm very encouraged by the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 8.8% as after-tax operating income grew 3.7% over the year-ago quarter and our share count declined by 4.9% due to our ongoing capital management initiatives.  This continues the favorable trend of balanced growth through earnings growth and capital management activities we've seen throughout 2016.
One of the primary drivers of our overall results this quarter was the performance of the Unum US Third quarter operating income was very strong at $231 million, an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Premium income growth continued its positive trend, increasing 5.9% over the year-ago quarter, helped in par for the inclusion of our dental acquisition. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.4% in the third quarter compared to 69.8% in the year-ago quarter with excellent results in the group disability line. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management continued to contribute to these favorable operating results. The other expense ratio declined to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of Unum US remains very strong with an operating ROE of 15% for the third quarter of 2016.
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was exceptionally strong this quarter at $85.4 million, an increase of 20.6% over last year. Premium income increased 2.8% over the year-ago quarter while pressure on net investment income continues as low new money yields pressure the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio was exceptional at 78.6% in the third quarter compared to 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. This improvement in the loss ratio was driven by strong renewal results over the past couple of years and continued favorable insurance and claim recovery trends.  These results leave us well positioned to absorb any discount rate pressures that may arise from today's low-interest rate environment while maintaining our group disability loss ratio in our expected 80% to 82% range.
Group Life and AD&D operating income declined to $53.4 million for the third quarter, down 11.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, but the benefit ratio increased to 72.6% from the third quarter compared to 71% in the year-ago quarter as a result of higher average claim size.
Net investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields as well as lower asset levels resulting from reduced capital in the Group Life line.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $92.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained very favorable, particularly with the addition of the dental business, increasing 12.1% in the quarter compared to last year. 
From the benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. Benefits experience for individual disability in the third quarter was generally consistent with the year-ago quarter, and benefits experienced for voluntary benefits was slightly less favorable relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by less favorable experience in the Life product line.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 21.5 million for the third quarter, an increase of 1.9% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter. The growth benefit of last year's dental acquisition was partially offset by pressure on growth from the existing customers, resulting from the current economic uncertainty. The benefit ratio was 71.8% for the third quarter, relative to a favorable 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increase in the benefit ratio was driven by higher [indiscernible] adjustments, which were offset by stronger net investment income [indiscernible] on the investment portfolio.
We also saw some pressure due to higher average claims size in both the Group Life and group long-term disability line. Overall, profitability of the U.K. segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 20.7% for the third quarter.
It's too -- it's still too early to tell what the long-term impact Brexit will be on our U.K. operations. The lower weighted average exchange rate of 131 in the third quarter compared to 155 in the year-ago quarter adversely impacted the translation of U.K. earnings back into U.S. dollars.  We do not expect to see much, if any impact to our claims experience, however, if employment trends and wage inflation slow down in the U.K. and sterling and interest rates remain under pressure, we likely to see some negative impact to our premium growth and the investment income trends. We started to see some slowdown in underlining Life's growth and wage inflation in the third quarter as companies appeared to be in a wait-and-see mode for further clarity on the details and implications of Brexit.
We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we'll be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters.
Colonial Life continued its trend of producing strong steady results with operating income of $79 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $76.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth accelerated to 6.3%, and the benefit ratio was 51.6% for the third quarter compared to 51.2% for the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE of 17.3% for the quarter.
Finally, the Closed Block. Operating income was $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.5% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting normal volatility.
For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 93.8% for the third quarter compared to 89.9% in the year-ago quarter. The long-term care loss ratio was elevated due to the termination of our largest group case, which also had a unique auto portability feature. I'll explain the impact of this termination in more detail in a moment.  In the absence of this event, the long-term care loss ratio would have been in the upper end of our 85% to 90% range.
Similar to the second quarter, we continued to see some pressure on new claims incidents and severity from rate increase notifications to policyholders that have been delivered recently. This impact was significantly diminished in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but we would expect and continue to see some impact over the next several quarters. Also, we experienced less favorable mortality experience in the long-term care line this quarter.
As I mentioned, long-term care results were negatively impacted this quarter by the termination of our largest group case, normally when a group long-term care termination occurs, we experience a small positive benefit to our financial results.  This case was unique and that had had an auto port feature, whereby employer-funded coverage automatically ported, and policyholders had to opt out in order to terminate their coverage. As life support, we changed the persistency assumption underlining new reserves from a group assumption to a significantly lower individual assumption, which results in a much larger reserve. The unusually large number of ports, coupled with the corresponding increase in reserves adversely impacted our loss ratio this quarter. In the absence of this unique case termination, our long-term care loss ratio would have been in the 85% to 90% range consistent with our long-term expectations.
I continue to be pleased with the progress we're experiencing on achieving rate increases on our in-force long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators and receiving several new rate increase approvals this quarter, we are continuing to see strong take up of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of derisking the portfolio. Since future claims will be [indiscernible] under the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes and reserve assumptions.
I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined 11.5% for the third quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions, particularly in the core market segment, where we have increased our rates to offset interest rate pressure. In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 19.7%. Core market sales declined 13.7% while large case sales were down 36.2%, reflecting a very tough comparison for large case in the year-ago quarter.
I'll remind you that the third quarter is the smallest sales quarter for the year, so quarterly volatility can be amplified. We remain committed to pricing discipline and maintaining strong margins in our business. The momentum in our voluntary and supplemental segment remains very encouraging with sales roughly in line with a strong year-ago quarter, driven by continued demand for supplemental products and the Starmount acquisition.
Our individual disability sales declined 23% against a very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from several large cases. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales were in line with the year-ago quarter.
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. The employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 89.9%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our in-force block to offset the impact of low interest rates and pressure on discount rates.
Our sales force, client management and underwriting teams are doing excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our in-force business. This is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.8% was favorable to prior year results, as was individual disability persistency at 91.2%.
Sales in Unum UK continued to rebound, increasing 15.6% in local currency with favorable trends across all segments. The inclusion of sales from last year's dental acquisition contributed 2% to this growth. Persistency was favorable at 86.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 3.9% this quarter. We expect sales to moderate in the wake of Brexit, and we'll continue to be disciplined in the U.K. market.
Finally, Colonial Life turned in another great quarter for new sales, increasing 9.3% for the third quarter and 12.7% for the first 9 months of the year. Growth remains well balanced between the core commercial market sector and the public sector as well as with sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts.
We've now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales growth, reflecting our continued investment in the business and a favorable environment. Strong leading indicators such as new sales rep recruiting and new sales rep productivity give us confidence that we can maintain this positive sales momentum as we look to invest more in our Colonial Life distribution system to build out territories and expand our presence geographically.
Persistency for Colonial Life was improved in the quarter to 79% from 78.6% last year. As a result, premium growth continues to build momentum, increasing 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Overall, we remain pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments. We feel it's important that we remain disciplined in our new business pricing in order to sustain the profit margins we have in our core business lines, particularly in Unum US, while it can be tempting to push for sales growth, we do not believe that this is appropriate time to do so.
Looking now on investment results. New money yields continue to come under pressure in the third quarter. Fortunately, we were able to meet our new money yield target of 5% for our long-term care portfolio again this quarter using our typical mix of investment classes and investment strategies, and we have exceeded this target every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. We will conclude this year's reserve review for long-term care over the next several weeks and currently believe that no special reserving will be necessary for year-end 2016.
If interest rates remain depressed when extended period of time, we could see pressure on future years, but I'd remind you that we have a substantial cushion between our GAAP and statutory reserves for long-term care, which means that any future reserve increase would most likely be a GAAP event with little or no impact to statutory reserves and then for a little to no impact on our capital deployment plans.
With respect to Unum US, long-term disability business, while we continue to maintain a healthy interest margin in our reserves, all-in yields have fallen significantly from year-end 2015 levels. On the other hand, the underlining profitability of our group disability business has improved significantly as a result of rate increases and disciplined risk management. At the risk of standing redundant, we are confident that the business can absorb any potential discount rate changes while maintaining an expected loss ratio in the 80% to 82% range. We will provide more clarity on this at our December Outlook Meeting.
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $546 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $433 million at the end of the second quarter and $19 million at the end of the first quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions and credit evaluation process we have followed for many years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio.
Moving to capital management. We repurchased $100 million of our shares in the third quarter, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, which is at the higher end of our range for holding company cash coverage needs.
During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company and paid off $350 million of maturing debt on September 30. Because of the higher debt level we've been carrying since our debt issuance in May 2016, our interest expense, which we report in the corporate segment, was $7 million higher this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. With the debt maturity, our quarterly debt expense will decline by approximately 5.5% in the fourth quarter relatively to this quarter.
The risk-based capital ratio for our traditional life insurance companies improved to approximately 395% towards the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400% for this year.
Statutory after-tax operating earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies were again outstanding at $211.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $187.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. This continues a strong trend in statutory earnings, which on a trailing 4-quarter basis now totals $806 million.
Throughout 2016, our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share has been expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. For the first 9 months of the year, we are beating that expectation with growth of 8.9%, driven by good premium growth, solid risk results and a focus on expense management. Therefore, for the full year of 2016, we now expect to be at, if not slightly above the upper end of our outlook range.
We will provide an outlook for 2017 at our December 15 Analyst Meeting, and while we are very encouraged by the operating trends we see in this year and the momentum it creates for next year, we will face headwinds created by low interest rates on our portfolio yields and discount rates as well as the impact of the decline in the British pound.
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the results for the first 3 quarters of 2016. We are executing very well on our strategy, particularly in critical areas such as maintaining pricing discipline despite increased competition in the U.S. market, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins despite interest rate pressure and achieving rate increases and meeting new money yield targets for long-term care. I believe that our success in these areas positions us well to continue to generate value for our shareholders in today's difficult environment.
Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

Thanks Humphrey. Great question. I'd start by referencing a point that Jack made in his comments, and that's third quarter is our smallest quarter, approximately it's a big year-to-year, but it's typically about 50% -- 15% of the year so it subject to a bit more volatility. And I think -- I would sort of take the sales results and put them into 2 buckets, and the first would be around volatility. And when we look at the large case group insurance business, voluntary benefits and IDI, I think we saw a little bit of volatility against some good large sales in the year-ago quarter. I feel really good about the traction we've got in the market at our value proposition and how we're competing. On the other side though, I would say core group insurance, it's less about volatility and it's more about sustained trend we've seen over the last several quarters. And to your question, while we've been moving rates up on new business slowly over the past, I'd say 2.5 years, we have not seen the corresponding increase from the market. And so we've seen close ratios fall off a bit, particularly, around new client sales. And while certainly, we would expect that given low interest rates, the market will eventually move to where we are, we just have not seen that yet. And you know us well enough to know that when the market allows us to write business at sustainable rates in the core, we will be there with all the capacity that's available. You know just in concluding what I'd say is, persistency remains really high, so not just to focus on new business, we are doing a good job, keeping clients and that's helping to fuel some really nice earned premium growth, almost 6% in the quarter."

So just to sort of give you a little bit of background to what's happening in the U.K., as you know we voted for to exit Europe in sort of June and since then, there is really being, what I would call an interim period where people are being try to work out what that means. How that's impacting our business, if you look at our result is sales going well, persistency going well. But natural growth, which is really lives and wage inflation has, basic is anemic. It's actually a bit lower than last year, where as -- when we were planning, we saw the economy would be getting to sort of start to motor, and really that's what I see happening in 2017 as well. As people are uncertain about the future, and I think the negotiations will go on in 2017, I think they'll be discerning about bringing new staff on and putting wage inflation into the economy and we'll see that remain low. So we might get 2% to 3% on lives and wage inflation in a good economy, I think it will be 1% to 1.5%, which is pretty much what we're seeing this year. So I think premiums will be lower than we expected, but we'll still get a better growth as we look forward on the scenario that we're planning. Although, I would also say that it is uncertain. And it depends on how the market reacts to those Brexit needed negotiations. So we're monitoring that. We are also taking action around the interest rates because they've dropped off a bit, and again, because the 10-year failed quite significantly. And the most obvious example of where our competitors will be impacted is in the exchange rates. So while also on a constant currency, I think it will be a bit lower than we expected. On an exchange rate, we're going to see that sort of $1.20 if it sticks there come through each quarter for the next 2 or 3 quarters when we do relative comparisons. We need to factor that into your analyst models."

So certainly, we had favorable new claim incidence and have had favorable claim incidence over the last several quarters, but a little bit more so here in the recent periods. I do think that probably for the bigger driver is just the continued impact of the strong risk management. So when we talked about new price discipline leading to a difficult new sales quarter for us, I wouldn't linked directly to being conservative in our pricing. And so as we've do in terms of new business and to our program, that has had the effect is lowering the benefit ratio and I think is a sustainable way. And if you put good risk management at the front of the business and we really strong consistent, high-quality benefits organization at the back end of the process, I think we're really pleased with the outcome. And so sitting where we are at this point is really good. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter and think about as Jack alluded to any necessary changes to the discount rate on new claim in LTD, should that be necessary, we feel really comfortable that business is healthy able to absorb that and maintain that target range for us, which is in the 80% to 82% loss ratio range."

It just -- we don't like to comment on other people's transactions. Obviously, I would highlight we have a very different business model, but there are some things environmentally, probably that's worth noting around the long-term care market. We've been discussing for some time that transactions in the space, particular to long-term care, will come in due course. We've seen some reinsurance transactions now. We see a situation without the buy and the seller in the space and so this does mean anything for us, but I'd certainly doesn't mean progress in terms of the capital markets, long-term care looking at different solutions. 
The second piece I note as well in this environment, we've been discussing the needs, Jack mentioned had again in terms of what we've been doing around rate actions in the market, the need for those rate increases and our book of business, we've been doing those actions, taking that on. And I think the environment given some of these things are very highlighted is becoming at least more knowledgeable about the need for rate increases and what's going on, and I think that's environment, that we're looking for. So those are a couple of things going on in that environment. And the last thing that I'd highlight is, we also as a company have significant strength across the board, that gives as a whole lot of its ability to do what we wanted to do, any options to pursue either structurally buying back our as they are doing consistently and making sure that we're taking actions that to benefit our shareholders.

And so I don't really want to talk about what is thing, I will tell you what we're seeing. And I think probably, the most fundamentally important point is we're not scrambling to keep pace with long-term care, we are working through the long-term care issue. And we're making significantly progress as a company toward doing that. We feel like we're in so much better shape today than we where in 3 years ago, and a lot of that is because of that active management of the block. So let me talk to you about what some of those things have been. In 2014, we recent assumptions. We placed those results on assumptions on a best estimate basis, using our current own experience. And our experience since then has been consistent with those expectations. We also established those -- when we established those reserves, we built in currently filed rate increases using historical approval rates, less than the third of those rate increase assumptions remain outstanding. We're making significant progress against them and feel very good about where the assumptions lie only small portion remaining that not only helps to support our reserve assumptions, but it also gives us to be the future to react future adverse claims experience should it emerge. 
The third point I'd make is, that our blocks unique in the long-term care business as approximately half of the block is group long-term care with employer funding and extremely conservative planned designs. And mostly -- and because of that group coverage and employer funding, most employees terminate their employer funded coverage when they leave the employer. As a result, our group long-term care has a lapse rate of closer to 10% versus less than 1% lapse rate from those individual long-term care policies. And our group long-term care has a substantially lower risk profile. But I think that really sets us apart as a company is the a vibrancy of our company and its market-leading position since strong profitability. We have great free cash flow generation from our core business since we have consistently over the last 6 years funded our long-term care capital needs, while still a allowing us to increase our dividend and consistent level of share repurchases. And as a result, our long-term care charges have logically being GAAP events and not cash events and we would expect that to continue into the future."

The third quarter was another excellent one for Unum with after-tax, operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first 9 months of 2016, after-tax operating income per share has also increased close to 9%. This performance exceeds the upper end of our outlook range for the year of 3% to 6% growth, and has driven in large part by solid premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, along with very consistent benefits experience.
I'm very encouraged that we are delivering these strong results despite today's difficult business environment, with historically low interest rates and more recently, the sharp decline in the value of the British pound. The reason we're delivering these results begins the leadership position we've established in the employee and voluntary benefits marketplace over many years. These markets offer good opportunities for growth over the long term. And we believe that our long-standing and focused commitment to serving our customers and advisers sets us apart from the competition. 
Our industry-leading expertise and our disciplined approach to the fundamental operations of our business have enabled us to grow our business with a high level of consistency and profitability. We'll cover these strategic points with you in greater detail at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December.
This morning, we'll focus on the strong financial results we have achieved in the third quarter as a result of the execution of this strategy. So now let me move to provide a few highlights on the quarter. 
First, the premium growth we're generating in our core operations remains healthy at approximately 4%. This trend continues to be driven by strong persistency levels in all of our core business lines and the volume of sales we've been generating over the last several years. While new sales trends are currently challenging in the Unum US markets due to competitive pricing conditions, we continue to see excellent sales trends at Colonial Life and experience a strong level of sales growth at Unum UK this year. Specifically, Colonial Life sales grew by 9.3% this quarter and 12.7% for the year-to-date.
Next, I continue to be very pleased with a strong profit margins we are consistently generating in our core business segments. This demonstrates the discipline we employ in all aspects of our business, including the pricing and underwriting of new business and the management of our in-force business relationships. All of this helps to provide a good balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins.
From a capital perspective, these strong operating results have continued to produce a strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which is the lifeblood of our financial flexibility. The third quarter was another excellent quarter for statutory earnings, which increased 13% and now exceed $800 million for the trailing 4 quarters.  This capital generation enables our capital deployment strategy, which starts with the opportunity to grow our business, both through the organic growth we're generating and the ability to capitalize upon attractive acquisition opportunities. It also has resulted in delivering steady repurchases of our shares and annual dividend increases.
On the acquisition side, we closed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company during the third quarter, providing the platform to grow what we believe will be a substantial Dental business over time. Dental is a good fit because it is a volume product that customers value. It is sold often at the workplace and as a voluntary product, it fits well in our existing product portfolio and distribution channel.
Another indicator of performance is the growth we have seen in book value per share, which in the third quarter is $40.33, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Book value excluding AOCI also increased 9.2% year-over-year to $38.39 at quarter end.
So in summary, it's been a very strong first 3 quarters of 2016. As I said earlier, I believe the success is largely a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This execution has multiple facets from underwriting and pricing to paying claims, to helping people return to work, all the while serving our customers very well. The combination of both operating and markets to provide good opportunities for growth and disciplined execution of our strategy leaves us very well positioned to deliver great value to our shareholders in the future.
So with those highlights on an excellent third quarter, I'd ask Jack to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Jack?"

Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results, now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter.

Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results, now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter. 
First, I'm very encouraged by the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 8.8% as after-tax operating income grew 3.7% over the year-ago quarter and our share count declined by 4.9% due to our ongoing capital management initiatives.  This continues the favorable trend of balanced growth through earnings growth and capital management activities we've seen throughout 2016.
One of the primary drivers of our overall results this quarter was the performance of the Unum US Third quarter operating income was very strong at $231 million, an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Premium income growth continued its positive trend, increasing 5.9% over the year-ago quarter, helped in par for the inclusion of our dental acquisition. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.4% in the third quarter compared to 69.8% in the year-ago quarter with excellent results in the group disability line. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management continued to contribute to these favorable operating results. The other expense ratio declined to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of Unum US remains very strong with an operating ROE of 15% for the third quarter of 2016.
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was exceptionally strong this quarter at $85.4 million, an increase of 20.6% over last year. Premium income increased 2.8% over the year-ago quarter while pressure on net investment income continues as low new money yields pressure the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio was exceptional at 78.6% in the third quarter compared to 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. This improvement in the loss ratio was driven by strong renewal results over the past couple of years and continued favorable insurance and claim recovery trends.  These results leave us well positioned to absorb any discount rate pressures that may arise from today's low-interest rate environment while maintaining our group disability loss ratio in our expected 80% to 82% range.
Group Life and AD&D operating income declined to $53.4 million for the third quarter, down 11.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, but the benefit ratio increased to 72.6% from the third quarter compared to 71% in the year-ago quarter as a result of higher average claim size.
Net investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields as well as lower asset levels resulting from reduced capital in the Group Life line.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $92.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained very favorable, particularly with the addition of the dental business, increasing 12.1% in the quarter compared to last year. 
From the benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. Benefits experience for individual disability in the third quarter was generally consistent with the year-ago quarter, and benefits experienced for voluntary benefits was slightly less favorable relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by less favorable experience in the Life product line.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 21.5 million for the third quarter, an increase of 1.9% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter. The growth benefit of last year's dental acquisition was partially offset by pressure on growth from the existing customers, resulting from the current economic uncertainty. The benefit ratio was 71.8% for the third quarter, relative to a favorable 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increase in the benefit ratio was driven by higher IFDI adjustments, which were offset by stronger net investment income on the investment portfolio.
We also saw some pressure due to higher average claims size in both the Group Life and group long-term disability line. Overall, profitability of the U.K. segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 20.7% for the third quarter.
It's too -- it's still too early to tell what the long-term impact Brexit will be on our U.K. operations. The lower weighted average exchange rate of 131 in the third quarter compared to 155 in the year-ago quarter adversely impacted the translation of U.K. earnings back into U.S. dollars.  We do not expect to see much, if any impact to our claims experience, however, if employment trends and wage inflation slow down in the U.K. and sterling and interest rates remain under pressure, we likely to see some negative impact to our premium growth and the investment income trends. We started to see some slowdown in underlining Life's growth and wage inflation in the third quarter as companies appeared to be in a wait-and-see mode for further clarity on the details and implications of Brexit.
We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we'll be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters.
Colonial Life continued its trend of producing strong steady results with operating income of $79 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $76.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth accelerated to 6.3%, and the benefit ratio was 51.6% for the third quarter compared to 51.2% for the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE of 17.3% for the quarter.
Finally, the Closed Block. Operating income was $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.5% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting normal volatility.
For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 93.8% for the third quarter compared to 89.9% in the year-ago quarter. The long-term care loss ratio was elevated due to the termination of our largest group case, which also had a unique auto portability feature. I'll explain the impact of this termination in more detail in a moment.  In the absence of this event, the long-term care loss ratio would have been in the upper end of our 85% to 90% range.
Similar to the second quarter, we continued to see some pressure on new claims incidents and severity from rate increase notifications to policyholders that have been delivered recently. This impact was significantly diminished in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but we would expect and continue to see some impact over the next several quarters. Also, we experienced less favorable mortality experience in the long-term care line this quarter.
As I mentioned, long-term care results were negatively impacted this quarter by the termination of our largest group case, normally when a group long-term care termination occurs, we experience a small positive benefit to our financial results.  This case was unique and that had had an auto port feature, whereby employer-funded coverage automatically ported, and policyholders had to opt out in order to terminate their coverage. As life support, we changed the persistency assumption underlining new reserves from a group assumption to a significantly lower individual assumption, which results in a much larger reserve. The unusually large number of ports, coupled with the corresponding increase in reserves adversely impacted our loss ratio this quarter. In the absence of this unique case termination, our long-term care loss ratio would have been in the 85% to 90% range consistent with our long-term expectations.
I continue to be pleased with the progress we're experiencing on achieving rate increases on our in-force long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators and receiving several new rate increase approvals this quarter, we are continuing to see strong take up of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of derisking the portfolio. Since future claims will be smaller under the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes and reserve assumptions.
I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined 11.5% for the third quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions, particularly in the core market segment, where we have increased our rates to offset interest rate pressure. In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 19.7%. Core market sales declined 13.7% while large case sales were down 36.2%, reflecting a very tough comparison for large case in the year-ago quarter.
I'll remind you that the third quarter is the smallest sales quarter for the year, so quarterly volatility can be amplified. We remain committed to pricing discipline and maintaining strong margins in our business. The momentum in our voluntary and supplemental segment remains very encouraging with sales roughly in line with a strong year-ago quarter, driven by continued demand for supplemental products and the Starmount acquisition.
Our individual disability sales declined 23% against a very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from several large cases. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales were in line with the year-ago quarter.
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. The employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 89.9%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our in-force block to offset the impact of low interest rates and pressure on discount rates.
Our sales force, client management and underwriting teams are doing excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our in-force business. This is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.8% was favorable to prior year results, as was individual disability persistency at 91.2%.
Sales in Unum UK continued to rebound, increasing 15.6% in local currency with favorable trends across all segments. The inclusion of sales from last year's dental acquisition contributed 2% to this growth. Persistency was favorable at 86.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 3.9% this quarter. We expect sales to moderate in the wake of Brexit, and we'll continue to be disciplined in the U.K. market.
Finally, Colonial Life turned in another great quarter for new sales, increasing 9.3% for the third quarter and 12.7% for the first 9 months of the year. Growth remains well balanced between the core commercial market sector and the public sector as well as with sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts.
We've now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales growth, reflecting our continued investment in the business and a favorable environment. Strong leading indicators such as new sales rep recruiting and new sales rep productivity give us confidence that we can maintain this positive sales momentum as we look to invest more in our Colonial Life distribution system to build out territories and expand our presence geographically.
Persistency for Colonial Life was improved in the quarter to 79% from 78.6% last year. As a result, premium growth continues to build momentum, increasing 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Overall, we remain pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments. We feel it's important that we remain disciplined in our new business pricing in order to sustain the profit margins we have in our core business lines, particularly in Unum US, while it can be tempting to push for sales growth, we do not believe that this is appropriate time to do so.
Looking now on investment results. New money yields continue to come under pressure in the third quarter. Fortunately, we were able to meet our new money yield target of 5% for our long-term care portfolio again this quarter using our typical mix of investment classes and investment strategies, and we have exceeded this target every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. We will conclude this year's reserve review for long-term care over the next several weeks and currently believe that no special reserving will be necessary for year-end 2016.
If interest rates remain depressed when extended period of time, we could see pressure on future years, but I'd remind you that we have a substantial cushion between our GAAP and statutory reserves for long-term care, which means that any future reserve increase would most likely be a GAAP event with little or no impact to statutory reserves and then for a little to no impact on our capital deployment plans.
With respect to Unum US, long-term disability business, while we continue to maintain a healthy interest margin in our reserves, all-in yields have fallen significantly from year-end 2015 levels. On the other hand, the underlining profitability of our group disability business has improved significantly as a result of rate increases and disciplined risk management. At the risk of standing redundant, we are confident that the business can absorb any potential discount rate changes while maintaining an expected loss ratio in the 80% to 82% range. We will provide more clarity on this at our December Outlook Meeting.
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $546 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $433 million at the end of the second quarter and $19 million at the end of the first quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions and credit evaluation process we have followed for many years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio.
Moving to capital management. We repurchased $100 million of our shares in the third quarter, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, which is at the higher end of our range for holding company cash coverage needs.
During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company and paid off $350 million of maturing debt on September 30. Because of the higher debt level we've been carrying since our debt issuance in May 2016, our interest expense, which we report in the corporate segment, was $7 million higher this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. With the debt maturity, our quarterly debt expense will decline by approximately 5.5% in the fourth quarter relatively to this quarter.
The risk-based capital ratio for our traditional life insurance companies improved to approximately 395% towards the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400% for this year.
Statutory after-tax operating earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies were again outstanding at $211.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $187.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. This continues a strong trend in statutory earnings, which on a trailing 4-quarter basis now totals $806 million.
Throughout 2016, our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share has been expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. For the first 9 months of the year, we are beating that expectation with growth of 8.9%, driven by good premium growth, solid risk results and a focus on expense management. Therefore, for the full year of 2016, we now expect to be at, if not slightly above the upper end of our outlook range.
We will provide an outlook for 2017 at our December 15 Analyst Meeting, and while we are very encouraged by the operating trends we see in this year and the momentum it creates for next year, we will face headwinds created by low interest rates on our portfolio yields and discount rates as well as the impact of the decline in the British pound.
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the results for the first 3 quarters of 2016. We are executing very well on our strategy, particularly in critical areas such as maintaining pricing discipline despite increased competition in the U.S. market, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins despite interest rate pressure and achieving rate increases and meeting new money yield targets for long-term care. I believe that our success in these areas positions us well to continue to generate value for our shareholders in today's difficult environment.
Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

Thanks Humphrey. Great question. I'd start by referencing a point that Jack made in his comments, and that's third quarter is our smallest quarter, approximately it's a big year-to-year, but it's typically about 50% -- 15% of the year so it subject to a bit more volatility. And I think -- I would sort of take the sales results and put them into 2 buckets, and the first would be around volatility. And when we look at the large case group insurance business, voluntary benefits and IDI, I think we saw a little bit of volatility against some good large sales in the year-ago quarter. I feel really good about the traction we've got in the market at our value proposition and how we're competing. On the other side though, I would say core group insurance, it's less about volatility and it's more about sustained trend we've seen over the last several quarters. And to your question, while we've been moving rates up on new business slowly over the past, I'd say 2.5 years, we have not seen the corresponding increase from the market. And so we've seen close ratios fall off a bit, particularly, around new client sales. And while certainly, we would expect that given low interest rates, the market will eventually move to where we are, we just have not seen that yet. And you know us well enough to know that when the market allows us to write business at sustainable rates in the core, we will be there with all the capacity that's available. You know just in concluding what I'd say is, persistency remains really high, so not just to focus on new business, we are doing a good job, keeping clients and that's helping to fuel some really nice earned premium growth, almost 6% in the quarter."

So just to sort of give you a little bit of background to what's happening in the U.K., as you know we voted for to exit Europe in sort of June and since then, there is really being, what I would call an interim period where people are being try to work out what that means. How that's impacting our business, if you look at our result is sales going well, persistency going well. But natural growth, which is really lives and wage inflation has, basic is anemic. It's actually a bit lower than last year, where as -- when we were planning, we saw the economy would be getting to sort of start to motor, and really that's what I see happening in 2017 as well. As people are uncertain about the future, and I think the negotiations will go on in 2017, I think they'll be discerning about bringing new staff on and putting wage inflation into the economy and we'll see that remain low. So we might get 2% to 3% on lives and wage inflation in a good economy, I think it will be 1% to 1.5%, which is pretty much what we're seeing this year. So I think premiums will be lower than we expected, but we'll still get a better growth as we look forward on the scenario that we're planning. Although, I would also say that it is uncertain. And it depends on how the market reacts to those Brexit needed negotiations. So we're monitoring that. We are also taking action around the interest rates because they've dropped off a bit, and again, because the 10-year failed quite significantly. And the most obvious example of where our competitors will be impacted is in the exchange rates. So while also on a constant currency, I think it will be a bit lower than we expected. On an exchange rate, we're going to see that sort of $1.20 if it sticks there come through each quarter for the next 2 or 3 quarters when we do relative comparisons. We need to factor that into your analyst models."

So certainly, we had favorable new claim incidents and have had favorable claim incidents over the last several quarters, but maybe a little bit more so here in the recent period. I do think probably proportionately though the bigger driver is just the continued impact of the strong risk management. So when we talked about new price discipline leading to a difficult new sales quarter for us, I would link that directly to being conservative in our pricing. And so as we work that through in terms of new business and through our renewal programs that has had the affect of lowering the benefit ratio and what I think is a sustainable way. And if you put good risk management at the front of the business and we're really strong consistent, high-quality benefits organization at the back end of the process, I think we're really pleased with the outcome. And so sitting where we are at this point is really good. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter and think about as Jack alluded to any necessary changes to the discount rate on new claim incurrals in LTD, should that be necessary, we feel really comfortable that, that business is healthy enough to be able to absorb that and maintain that target range for us, which is in the 80% to 82% loss ratio range."

And just -- we don't like to comment on other people's transactions. Obviously, I would highlight we have a very different business model, but there are some things environmentally, probably that's worth noting around the long-term care market. We've been discussing for some time that transactions in the space, particular to long-term care will come in due course. We've seen some reinsurance transactions now. We see a situation with us a buyer and a seller in the space and so this doesn't mean anything imminent for us, but certainly, I think it doesn't mean progress in terms of the capital markets, long-term care and looking at different solutions. 
The second piece I'd note as well is in this environment, we've been discussing the needs, Jack mentioned that again in terms of what we've been doing around rate actions in the market, the need for those rate increases and our book of business. We've been doing those actions, taking that on. And I think the environment, given some of these things are being highlighted is becoming at least more knowledgeable about the need for rate increases and what's going on, and I think that's the environment that we're looking for. So those are a couple of things going on in that environment. And the last thing I'd highlight is, we also as a company have significant strength across the board that gives us a whole lot of flexibility to do what we wanted to do, any options to pursue, either structurally buying back our shares as we're doing consistently and making sure that we're taking actions ultimately benefit our shareholders. I think, I had a question specific to some of the things they did, some of the things they're seeing in their long-term care block, and maybe Jack you can make a couple of comments on how it translates or it doesn't translate to our book of business."

And so I don't really want to talk about what Genworth is seeing. I will tell you what we're seeing. And I think probably, the most fundamentally important point is we're not scrambling to keep pace with long-term care, we are working through the long-term care issue. And we're making significant progress as a company towards doing that. We feel like we're in so much better shape today than we were even 3 years ago, and a lot of that is because of that active management of the block. So let me talk to you about what some of those things have been. In 2014, we reset reserve assumptions. We placed those reserve assumptions on a best estimate basis, using our current own experience. And our experience since then has been consistent with those expectations. We also established those -- when we established those reserves, we built in currently filed rate increases using historical approval rates, less than 1/3 of those rate increase assumptions remain outstanding. We're making significant progress against them and feel very good about where the assumptions lie with only a small portion remaining, that not only helps to support our reserve assumptions, but it also gives us room in the future to react future adverse claims experience should it emerge.  The third point I'd make is, that our blocks are unique in the long-term care business as approximately half of the block is group long-term care with employer funding and extremely conservant plan designs. And mostly -- and because of that group coverage and employer funding, most employees terminate their employer-funded coverage when they leave the employer. As a result, our group long-term care has a lapse rate of closer to 10% versus less than 1% lapse rate from those individual long-term care policies. And our group long-term care has a substantially lower risk profile. But I think that saying that really sets us apart as a company, is the vibrancy of our company and its market-leading position since strong profitability. We have great free cash flow generation from our core business since we have consistently, over the last 6 years, funded our long-term care capital needs while still allowing us to increase our dividend to maintain consistent level of share repurchases. As a result, our long-term care charges have largely being GAAP events, they're not cash events and we would expect that to continue into the future."

The third quarter was another excellent one for Unum with after-tax operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first 9 months of 2016, after-tax operating income",763,"Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another excellent one for Unum with after-tax operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first 9 months of 2016, after-tax operating income per share has also increased close to 9%. This performance exceeds the upper end of our outlook range for the year of 3% to 6% growth, and was driven in large part by solid premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, along with very consistent benefits experience.
I'm very encouraged that we are delivering these strong results despite today's difficult business environment, with historically low interest rates and more recently the sharp decline in the value of the British pound. The reason we're delivering these results begins at the leadership position we've established in the employee and voluntary benefits marketplace over many years. These markets offer good opportunities for growth over the long term. And we believe that our long-standing and focused commitment to serving our customers and advisers sets us apart from the competition. 
Our industry-leading expertise and our disciplined approach to the fundamental operations of our business have enabled us to grow our business with a high level of consistency and profitability. We'll cover these strategic points with you in greater detail at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December.
This morning we'll focus on the strong financial results we have achieved in the third quarter as a result of the execution of this strategy. So now let me move to provide a few highlights on the quarter. 
First, the premium growth we are generating in our core operations remains healthy at approximately 4%. This trend continues to be driven by strong persistency levels in all of our core business lines and the volume of sales we've been generating over the last several years. While new sales trends are currently challenging in the Unum US markets, due to competitive pricing conditions, we continue to see excellent sales trends at Colonial Life and experience a strong level of sales growth at Unum UK this year. Specifically, Colonial Life sales grew by 9.3% this quarter and 12.7% for the year to date.
Next, I continue to be very pleased with the strong profit margins we are consistently generating in our core business segments. This demonstrates the discipline we employ in all aspects of our business, including the pricing and underwriting of new business and the management of our in-force business relationships. All of this helps to provide a good balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins.
From a capital perspective, these strong operating results have continued to produce a strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which is the lifeblood of our financial flexibility. The third quarter was another excellent quarter for statutory earnings, which increased 13% and now exceed $800 million for the trailing 4 quarters.  This capital generation enables our capital deployment strategy, which starts with the opportunity to grow our business, both through the organic growth we are generating and the ability to capitalize upon attractive acquisition opportunities. It also has resulted in delivering steady repurchases of our shares and annual dividend increases.
On the acquisitions side, we closed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company during the third quarter, providing the platform to grow what we believe will be a substantial Dental business over time. Dental is a good fit because it is a volume product that customers value. It is sold often at the workplace and as a voluntary product it fits well in our existing product portfolio and distribution channel.
Another indicator of performance is the growth we have seen in book value per share, which in the third quarter is $40.33, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Book value excluding AOCI also increased 9.2% year-over-year to $38.39 at quarter end.
So in summary, it's been a very strong first 3 quarters of 2016. As I said earlier, I believe the success is largely a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This execution has multiple facets from underwriting and pricing to paying claims, to helping people return to work, all the while serving our customers very well. The combination of both operating and markets that provide good opportunities for growth and disciplined execution of our strategy leaves us very well positioned to deliver great value to our shareholders in the future.
So with those highlights on an excellent third quarter, I'd ask Jack to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Jack?"
166762,403206906,1063612,"Unum Group, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Unum Group","Executives","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results.  Now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter. First, I'm very encouraged by the compositi",2798,"Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results.  Now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter. 
First, I'm very encouraged by the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 8.8%, as after-tax operating income grew 3.7% over the year-ago quarter and our share count declined by 4.9%, due to our ongoing capital management initiatives.  This continues the favorable trend of balanced growth through earnings growth and capital management activities we've seen throughout 2016.
One of the primary drivers of our overall results this quarter was the performance of Unum US.  Third quarter operating income was very strong at $231 million, an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Premium income growth continued its positive trend, increasing 5.9% over the year-ago quarter, helped in par by the inclusion of our dental acquisition. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.4% in the third quarter compared to 69.8% in the year-ago quarter, with excellent results in the group disability line. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management continued to contribute to these favorable operating results. The other expense ratio declined to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of Unum US remains very strong, with an operating ROE of 15% for the third quarter of 2016.
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was exceptionally strong this quarter at $85.4 million, an increase of 20.6% over last year. Premium income increased 2.8% over the year-ago quarter, while pressure on net investment income continues as low new money yields pressure the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio was exceptional at 78.6% in the third quarter compared to 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. This improvement in the loss ratio was driven by strong renewal results over the past couple of years and continued favorable incidents and claim recovery trends.  These results leave us well positioned to absorb any discount rate pressures that may arise from today's low interest rate environment while maintaining our group disability loss ratio in our expected 80% to 82% range.
Group Life and AD&D operating income declined to $53.4 million for the third quarter, down 11.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, but the benefit ratio increased to 72.6% for the third quarter compared to 71% in the year-ago quarter, as a result of higher average claim size.
Net investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields as well as lower asset levels resulting from reduced capital in the Group Life line.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $92.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained very favorable, particularly with the addition of the dental business, increasing 12.1% in the quarter compared to last year. 
From the benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. Benefits experience for individual disability in the third quarter was generally consistent with the year-ago quarter, and benefits experience for voluntary benefits was slightly less favorable relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by less favorable experience in the Life product line.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 21.5 million for the third quarter, an increase of 1.9% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter. The growth benefit of last year's dental acquisition was partially offset by pressure on growth from its existing [ph] customers, resulting from the current economic uncertainty. The benefit ratio was 71.8% for the third quarter, relative to a favorable 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increase in the benefit ratio was driven by higher IFDI adjustments, which were offset by stronger net investment income on the investment portfolio.
We also saw some pressure due to higher average claims size in both the Group Life and group long-term disability line. Overall, profitability of the U.K. segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 20.7% for the third quarter.
It's too -- it's still too early to tell what the long-term impact Brexit will be on our U.K. operations. The lower weighted average exchange rate of 131 in the third quarter compared to 155 in the year-ago quarter adversely impacted the translation of U.K. earnings back into U.S. dollars.  We do not expect to see much, if any, impact to our claims experience, however, if employment trends and wage inflation slow down in the U.K. and sterling and interest rates remain under pressure, we are likely to see some negative impact to our premium growth and the investment income trends. We started to see some slowdown in underlining Life's growth and wage inflation in the third quarter as companies appear to be in a wait-and-see mode for further clarity on the details and implications of Brexit.
We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we'll be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters.
Colonial Life continued its trend of producing strong, steady results with operating income of $79 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $76.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth accelerated to 6.3%, and the benefit ratio was 51.6% for the third quarter compared to 51.2% for the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE of 17.3% for the quarter.
Finally, the Closed Block. Operating income was $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.5% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting normal volatility.
For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 93.8% for the third quarter compared to 89.9% in the year-ago quarter. The long-term care loss ratio was elevated due to the termination of our largest group case, which also had a unique auto portability feature. I'll explain the impact of this termination in more detail in a moment.  In the absence of this event, the long-term care loss ratio would have been in the upper end of our 85% to 90% range.
Similar to the second quarter, we continue to see some pressure on new claims incidents and severity from rate increase notifications to policyholders that have been delivered recently. This impact was significantly diminished in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but we would expect it continue to see some impact over the next several quarters. Also, we experienced less favorable mortality experience in the long-term care line this quarter.
As I mentioned, long-term care results were negatively impacted this quarter by the termination of our largest group case.  Normally, when a group long-term care termination occurs, we experience a small positive benefit to our financial results.  This case was unique in that it had an auto port feature, whereby employer-funded coverage automatically ported, and policyholders had to opt out in order to terminate their coverage. As lives port, we changed the persistency assumption underlining new reserves from a group assumption to a significantly lower individual assumption, which results in a much larger reserve. The unusually large number of ports, coupled with the corresponding increase in reserves adversely impacted our loss ratio this quarter. In the absence of this unique case termination, our long-term care loss ratio would have been in the 85% to 90% range consistent with our long-term expectations.
I continue to be pleased with the progress we're experiencing on achieving rate increases on our in-force long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators and receiving several new rate increase approvals this quarter, we are continuing to see strong take up of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of de-risking the portfolio. Since future claims will be smaller under the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes and reserve assumptions.
I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined 11.5% for the third quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions, particularly in the core market segment, where we have increased our rates to offset interest rate pressure. In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 19.7%. Core market sales declined 13.7%, while large case sales were down 36.2%, reflecting a very tough comparison for large case in the year-ago quarter.
I'll remind you that the third quarter is the smallest sales quarter for the year, so quarterly volatility can be amplified. We remain committed to pricing discipline and maintaining strong margins in our business. The momentum in our voluntary and supplemental segment remains very encouraging with sales roughly in line with a strong year-ago quarter, driven by continued demand for supplemental products and the Starmount acquisition.
Our individual disability sales declined 23% against a very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from several large cases. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales were in line with the year-ago quarter.
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. The employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 89.9%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our in-force block to offset the impact of low interest rates and pressure on discount rates.
Our sales force, client management and underwriting teams do an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our in-force business. This is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.8% was favorable to prior-year results, as was individual disability persistency at 91.2%.
Sales in Unum UK continue to rebound, increasing 15.6% in local currency with favorable trends across all segments. The inclusion of sales from last year's dental acquisition contributed 2% to this growth. Persistency was favorable at 86.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 3.9% this quarter. We expect sales to moderate in the wake of Brexit, and we'll continue to be disciplined in the U.K. market.
Finally, Colonial Life turned in another great quarter for new sales, increasing 9.3% for the third quarter and 12.7% for the first 9 months of the year. Growth remains well balanced between the core commercial market sector and the public sector as well as with sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts.
We've now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales growth, reflecting our continued investment in the business and a favorable environment. Strong leading indicators such as new sales rep recruiting and new sales rep productivity give us confidence that we can maintain this positive sales momentum as we look to invest more in our Colonial Life distribution system to build out territories and expand our presence geographically.
Persistency for Colonial Life was improved in the quarter to 79% from 78.6% last year. As a result, premium growth continues to build momentum, increasing 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Overall, we remain pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments. We feel it's important that we remain disciplined in our new business pricing in order to sustain the profit margins we have in our core business lines, particularly in Unum US.  While it can be tempting to push for sales growth, we do not believe that this is appropriate time to do so.
Looking now on investment results. New money yields continue to come under pressure in the third quarter. Fortunately, we were able to meet our new money yield target of 5% for our long-term care portfolio again this quarter, using our typical mix of investment classes and investment strategies, and we have exceeded this target every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. We will conclude this year's reserve review for long-term care over the next several weeks and currently believe that no special reserving will be necessary for year-end 2016.
If interest rates remain depressed for an extended period of time, we could see pressure on future years, but I'd remind you that we have a substantial cushion between our GAAP and statutory reserves for long-term care, which means that any future reserve increase would most likely be a GAAP event with little or no impact to statutory reserves and therefore little to no impact on our capital deployment plans.
With respect to Unum US' long-term disability business, while we continue to maintain a healthy interest margin in our reserves, all-in yields have fallen significantly from year-end 2015 levels. On the other hand, the underlining profitability of our group disability business has improved significantly as a result of rate increases and disciplined risk management. At the risk of sounding redundant, we are confident that the business can absorb any potential discount rate changes while maintaining an expected loss ratio in the 80% to 82% range. We will provide more clarity on this at our December Outlook Meeting.
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $546 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $433 million at the end of the second quarter and $19 million at the end of the first quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions and credit evaluation process we have followed for many years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio.
Moving to capital management. We repurchased $100 million of our shares in the third quarter, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, which is at the higher end of our range for holding company cash coverage needs.
During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company and paid off $350 million of maturing debt on September 30. Because of the higher debt level we've been carrying since our debt issuance in May 2016, our interest expense, which we report in the corporate segment, was $7 million higher this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. With the debt maturity, our quarterly debt expense will decline by approximately 5.5% in the fourth quarter relative to this quarter.
The risk-based capital ratio for our traditional life insurance companies improved to approximately 395% toward the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400% for this year.
Statutory after-tax operating earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies were again outstanding at $211.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $187.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. This continues a strong trend in statutory earnings, which on a trailing 4-quarter basis now totals $806 million.
Throughout 2016, our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share has been expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. For the first 9 months of the year, we are beating that expectation with growth of 8.9%, driven by good premium growth, solid risk results and a focus on expense management. Therefore, for the full year of 2016, we now expect to be at, if not slightly above the upper end of our outlook range.
We will provide an outlook for 2017 at our December 15 Analyst Meeting, and while we are very encouraged by the operating trends we've seen this year and the momentum it creates for next year, we will face headwinds created by low interest rates on our portfolio yields and discount rates as well as the impact of the decline in the British pound.
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the results for the first 3 quarters of 2016. We are executing very well on our strategy, particularly in critical areas such as maintaining pricing discipline despite increased competition in the U.S. market, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins despite interest rate pressure and achieving rate increases and meeting new money yield targets for long-term care. I believe that our success in these areas positions us well to continue to generate value for our shareholders in today's difficult environment.
Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

Thanks Humphrey. Great question. I'd start by referencing a point that Jack made in his comments, and that's third quarter is our smallest quarter, fluctuates a bit year-to-year, but it's typically about 50% -- 15% of the year so it's subject to a bit more volatility. And I think -- I would sort of take the sales results and put them into 2 buckets, and the first would be around volatility. And when we look at the large case group insurance business, voluntary benefits and IDI, I think we saw a little bit of volatility against some good, large sales in the year-ago quarter. I feel really good about the traction we've got in the market at our value proposition and how we're competing. On the other side though, I would say core group insurance, it's less about volatility and it's more about sustained trend we've seen over the last several quarters. And to your question, while we've been moving rates up on new business slowly over the past I'd say 2.5 years, we have not seen the corresponding increase from the market. And so we've seen close ratios fall off a bit, particularly around new client sales. And while certainly we would expect that given low interest rates the market will eventually move to where we are, we just have not seen that yet. And you know us well enough to know that when the market allows us to write business at sustainable rates in the core, we will be there with all the capacity that's available. You know, just in concluding, what I'd say is persistency remains really high, so not just to focus on new business.  We are doing a good job keeping clients and that's helping to fuel some really nice earned premium growth, almost 6% in the quarter."

So just to sort of give you a little bit of background to what's happening in the U.K., as you know we voted for -- to exit Europe in sort of June and since then there has really been, what I would call an interim period, where people have been -- try to work out what that means. How that's impacting our business, if you look at our results is sales going well, persistency going well, but natural growth, which is really lives and wage inflation has, basic is anemic. It's actually a bit lower than last year, where as -- when we were planning, we thought the economy would be getting to sort of start to motor, and really that's what I see happening in 2017 as well. Is that as people are uncertain about the future, and I think the negotiations will go on in 2017, I think they'll be discerning about bringing new staff on and putting wage inflation into the economy and we'll see that remain low. So we might get 2% to 3% on lives and wage inflation in a good economy, I think it'll be 1% to 1.5%, which is pretty much what we're seeing this year. So I think premiums will be lower than we expected, but we'll still get a bit of growth as we look forward on the scenario that we're planning. Although, I would also say that it is uncertain. And it depends on how the market reacts to those Brexit negotiations. 
So we're monitoring that. We are also taking action around the interest rates because they've dropped off a bit, and again, because the 10-year fell quite significantly. And the most obvious example of where our comparators will be impacted is in the exchange rates. So whilst on a constant currency, I think it will be a bit lower than we expected. On an exchange rate, we're going to see that sort of $1.20 if it sticks there come through each quarter for the next 2 or 3 quarters when we do relative comparisons so you need to factor that into your analyst models."

If you go back and you look at our cash holdings by quarter.  If you back out those significant events, you don't see a drop in cash in the third quarter, I'd also -- I mean, in the fourth quarter -- I'd also note that the fourth quarter is a lighter cash needs from an interest expense perspective, because most of our coupons are due in the first and third quarter.

So certainly we had favorable new claim incidents and have had favorable new claim incidents over the last several quarters, but probably a little bit more so here in the recent period. I do think probably proportionately though the bigger driver is just the continued impact of the strong risk management. So when we talked about new price discipline leading to a difficult new sales quarter for us, I would link that directly to being conservative in our pricing. And so as we've worked that through in terms of new business and through our renewal programs, that has had the affect of lowering the benefit ratio in what I think is a sustainable way. And if you put good risk management at the front of the business and we're really strong consistent, high-quality benefits organization at the back end of the process, I think we're really pleased with the outcome. And so sitting where we are at this point is really good. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter and think about, as Jack alluded to, any necessary changes to the discount rate on new claim incurrals in LTD, should that be necessary, we feel really comfortable that, that business is healthy enough to be able to absorb that and maintain that target range for us, which is in the 80% to 82% loss ratio range."

Just -- we don't like to comment on other people's transactions, obviously.  I would highlight we have a very different business model, but there are some things environmentally, probably worth noting around the long-term care market. We've been discussing for some time that transactions in the space, particular to long-term care will come in due course. We've seen some reinsurance transactions.  Now we see a situation where there's a buyer and a seller in the space and so this doesn't mean anything imminent for us, but I certainly think it does mean progress in terms of the capital markets, long-term care and looking at different solutions. 
The second piece I'd note as well is in this environment, we've been discussing the needs, Jack mentioned that again in terms of what we've been doing around rate actions in the market, the need for those rate increases and our book of business. We've been doing those actions, taking that on. And I think the environment, given some of these things are being highlighted is becoming at least more knowledgeable about the need for rate increases and what's going on, and I think that's the environment that we're looking for. So those are a couple of things going on in that environment. And the last thing I'd highlight is, we also as a company have significant strength across the board that gives us a whole lot of flexibility to do what we wanted to do, any options to pursue, either structurally buying back our shares, as we're doing consistently, and making sure we're taking actions to ultimately benefit our shareholders. I think you had a question specific to some of the things they did, some of the things they're seeing in their long-term care block, and maybe Jack you can make a couple of comments on how it translates or it doesn't translate to our book of business."

And so I don't really want to talk about what Genworth is seeing. I will tell you what we're seeing. And I think probably the most fundamentally important point is we're not scrambling to keep pace with long-term care.  We are working through the long-term care issue, and we're making significant progress as a company towards doing that. We feel like we're in so much better shape today than we were even 3 years ago, and a lot of that is because of that active management of the block. So let me talk to you about what some of those things have been. In 2014, we reset reserve assumptions. We placed those reserve assumptions on a best estimate basis, using our current own experience. And our experience since then has been consistent with those expectations. We also established those -- when we established those reserves, we built in currently filed rate increases using historical approval rates, less than 1/3 of those rate increase assumptions remain outstanding. We're making significant progress against them and feel very good about where the assumptions lie with only a small portion remaining.  That not only helps to support our reserve assumptions, but it also gives us room in the future to react to future adverse claims experience, should it emerge.  The third point I'd make is that our block's unique in the long-term care business, as approximately half of the block is group long-term care with employer funding and extremely conservant plan designs. And mostly -- and because of that group coverage and employer funding, most employees terminate their employer-funded coverage when they leave the employer. As a result, our group long-term care has a lapse rate of closer to 10% versus a less than 1% lapse rate for most individual long-term care policies. And our group long-term care has a substantially lower risk profile. But I think the thing that really sets us apart as a company is the vibrancy of our company and its market-leading positions and strong profitability. We have great free cash flow generation from our core businesses.  We have consistently, over the last 6 years, funded our long-term care capital needs while still allowing us to increase our dividend and maintain consistent level of share repurchases. As a result, our long-term care charges have largely been GAAP events and not cash events, and we would expect that to continue into the future."

They -- rates move, spreads move, supply and demand in the marketplace move, asset classes don't all move in sync and so without -- it is really hard to predict exactly where your new money rates are going to fall in any year. Clearly, there's pressure. But we do have a good margin currently in our discount rate for long-term care versus our portfolio yield. We had the expectation that we'd be at 5% for 4 to 5 years. In 2017, we'll be 3 years into that. So it's going to be a judgment call whether it's 2017, 2018.

The third quarter was another excellent one for Unum with after-tax operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first 9 months of 2016, after-tax operating income",763,"Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another excellent one for Unum with after-tax operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first 9 months of 2016, after-tax operating income per share has also increased close to 9%. This performance exceeds the upper end of our outlook range for the year of 3% to 6% growth, and was driven in large part by solid premium growth in Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life, along with very consistent benefits experience.
I'm very encouraged that we are delivering these strong results despite today's difficult business environment, with historically low interest rates and more recently the sharp decline in the value of the British pound. The reason we're delivering these results begins at the leadership position we've established in the employee and voluntary benefits marketplace over many years. These markets offer good opportunities for growth over the long term. And we believe that our long-standing and focused commitment to serving our customers and advisers sets us apart from the competition. 
Our industry-leading expertise and our disciplined approach to the fundamental operations of our business have enabled us to grow our business with a high level of consistency and profitability. We'll cover these strategic points with you in greater detail at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December.
This morning we'll focus on the strong financial results we have achieved in the third quarter as a result of the execution of this strategy. So now let me move to provide a few highlights on the quarter. 
First, the premium growth we are generating in our core operations remains healthy at approximately 4%. This trend continues to be driven by strong persistency levels in all of our core business lines and the volume of sales we've been generating over the last several years. While new sales trends are currently challenging in the Unum US markets, due to competitive pricing conditions, we continue to see excellent sales trends at Colonial Life and experience a strong level of sales growth at Unum UK this year. Specifically, Colonial Life sales grew by 9.3% this quarter and 12.7% for the year to date.
Next, I continue to be very pleased with the strong profit margins we are consistently generating in our core business segments. This demonstrates the discipline we employ in all aspects of our business, including the pricing and underwriting of new business and the management of our in-force business relationships. All of this helps to provide a good balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry-leading profit margins.
From a capital perspective, these strong operating results have continued to produce a strong level of statutory earnings and capital, which is the lifeblood of our financial flexibility. The third quarter was another excellent quarter for statutory earnings, which increased 13% and now exceed $800 million for the trailing 4 quarters.  This capital generation enables our capital deployment strategy, which starts with the opportunity to grow our business, both through the organic growth we are generating and the ability to capitalize upon attractive acquisition opportunities. It also has resulted in delivering steady repurchases of our shares and annual dividend increases.
On the acquisitions side, we closed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company during the third quarter, providing the platform to grow what we believe will be a substantial Dental business over time. Dental is a good fit because it is a volume product that customers value. It is sold often at the workplace and as a voluntary product it fits well in our existing product portfolio and distribution channel.
Another indicator of performance is the growth we have seen in book value per share, which in the third quarter is $40.33, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Book value excluding AOCI also increased 9.2% year-over-year to $38.39 at quarter end.
So in summary, it's been a very strong first 3 quarters of 2016. As I said earlier, I believe the success is largely a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This execution has multiple facets from underwriting and pricing to paying claims, to helping people return to work, all the while serving our customers very well. The combination of both operating and markets that provide good opportunities for growth and disciplined execution of our strategy leaves us very well positioned to deliver great value to our shareholders in the future.
So with those highlights on an excellent third quarter, I'd ask Jack to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Jack?"

First, I'm very encouraged by the composition of our after-tax operating income per share growth of 8.8%, as after-tax operating income grew 3.7% over the year-ago quarter and our share count declined by 4.9%, due to our ongoing capital management initiatives.  This continues the favorable trend of balanced growth through earnings growth and capital management activities we've seen throughout 2016.
One of the primary drivers of our overall results this quarter was the performance of Unum US.  Third quarter operating income was very strong at $231 million, an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Premium income growth continued its positive trend, increasing 5.9% over the year-ago quarter, helped in part by the inclusion of our dental acquisition. The benefit ratio for Unum US segment improved to 69.4% in the third quarter compared to 69.8% in the year-ago quarter, with excellent results in the group disability line. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management continued to contribute to these favorable operating results. The other expense ratio declined to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. The profitability of Unum US remains very strong, with an operating ROE of 15% for the third quarter of 2016.
Within the Unum US segment, operating income in our group disability business was exceptionally strong this quarter at $85.4 million, an increase of 20.6% over last year. Premium income increased 2.8% over the year-ago quarter, while pressure on net investment income continues as low new money yields pressure the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio was exceptional at 78.6% in the third quarter compared to 80.5% in the year-ago quarter. This improvement in the loss ratio was driven by strong renewal results over the past couple of years and continued favorable incidents and claim recovery trends.  These results leave us well positioned to absorb any discount rate pressures that may arise from today's low interest rate environment while maintaining our group disability loss ratio in our expected 80% to 82% range.
Group Life and AD&D operating income declined to $53.4 million for the third quarter, down 11.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, but the benefit ratio increased to 72.6% for the third quarter compared to 71% in the year-ago quarter, as a result of higher average claim size.
Net investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields as well as lower asset levels resulting from reduced capital in the Group Life line.
Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was also very strong at $92.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.1% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained very favorable, particularly with the addition of the dental business, increasing 12.1% in the quarter compared to last year. 
From the benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations. Benefits experience for individual disability in the third quarter was generally consistent with the year-ago quarter, and benefits experience for voluntary benefits was slightly less favorable relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by less favorable experience in the Life product line.
Looking at Unum UK. Operating income was GBP 21.5 million for the third quarter, an increase of 1.9% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter. The growth benefit of last year's dental acquisition was partially offset by pressure on growth from its existing [ph] customers, resulting from the current economic uncertainty. The benefit ratio was 71.8% for the third quarter, relative to a favorable 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increase in the benefit ratio was driven by higher IFDI adjustments, which were offset by stronger net investment income on the investment portfolio.
We also saw some pressure due to higher average claims size in both the Group Life and group long-term disability line. Overall, profitability of the U.K. segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 20.7% for the third quarter.
It's too -- it's still too early to tell what the long-term impact Brexit will be on our U.K. operations. The lower weighted average exchange rate of 131 in the third quarter compared to 155 in the year-ago quarter adversely impacted the translation of U.K. earnings back into U.S. dollars.  We do not expect to see much, if any, impact to our claims experience, however, if employment trends and wage inflation slowdown in the U.K. and sterling and interest rates remain under pressure, we are likely to see some negative impact to our premium growth and the investment income trends. We started to see some slowdown in underlining Life's growth and wage inflation in the third quarter as companies appear to be in a wait-and-see mode for further clarity on the details and implications of Brexit.
We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the U.K. has not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we'll be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters.
Colonial Life continued its trend of producing strong, steady results with operating income of $79 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $76.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth accelerated to 6.3%, and the benefit ratio was 51.6% for the third quarter compared to 51.2% for the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE of 17.3% for the quarter.
Finally, the Closed Block. Operating income was $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.5% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting normal volatility.
For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 93.8% for the third quarter compared to 89.9% in the year-ago quarter. The long-term care loss ratio was elevated due to the termination of our largest group case, which also had a unique auto portability feature. I'll explain the impact of this termination in more detail in a moment.  In the absence of this event, the long-term care loss ratio would have been in the upper end of our 85% to 90% range.
Similar to the second quarter, we continue to see some pressure on new claims incidents and severity from rate increase notifications to policyholders that have been delivered recently. This impact was significantly diminished in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but we would expect it continue to see some impact over the next several quarters. Also, we experienced less favorable mortality experience in the long-term care line this quarter.
As I mentioned, long-term care results were negatively impacted this quarter by the termination of our largest group case.  Normally, when a group long-term care termination occurs, we experience a small positive benefit to our financial results.  This case was unique in that it had an auto port feature, whereby employer-funded coverage automatically ported, and policyholders had to opt out in order to terminate their coverage. As lives port, we changed the persistency assumption underlining new reserves from a group assumption to a significantly lower individual assumption, which results in a much larger reserve. The unusually large number of ports, coupled with the corresponding increase in reserves adversely impacted our loss ratio this quarter. In the absence of this unique case termination, our long-term care loss ratio would have been in the 85% to 90% range consistent with our long-term expectations.
I continue to be pleased with the progress we're experiencing on achieving rate increases on our in-force long-term care business. In addition to making good progress with state regulators and receiving several new rate increase approvals this quarter, we are continuing to see strong take up of the lending spot option. The lending spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases, but also has the added benefit of de-risking the portfolio. Since future claims will be smaller under the lending spot, the reserves will be somewhat less sensitive to future changes and reserve assumptions.
I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with Unum US, total sales declined 11.5% for the third quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions, particularly in the core market segment, where we have increased our rates to offset interest rate pressure. In total for LTD, STD and Group Life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 19.7%. Core market sales declined 13.7%, while large case sales were down 36.2%, reflecting a very tough comparison for large case in the year-ago quarter.
I'll remind you that the third quarter is the smallest sales quarter for the year, so quarterly volatility can be amplified. We remain committed to pricing discipline and maintaining strong margins in our business. The momentum in our voluntary and supplemental segment remains very encouraging with sales roughly in line with a strong year-ago quarter, driven by continued demand for supplemental products and the Starmount acquisition.
Our individual disability sales declined 23% against a very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from several large cases. In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales were in line with the year-ago quarter.
Persistency for Unum US is at very healthy levels. The employee benefits lines combined, persistency was 89.9%. This is important to us as we look to move price increases into our in-force block to offset the impact of low interest rates and pressure on discount rates.
Our sales force, client management and underwriting teams do an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our in-force business. This is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.8% was favorable to prior-year results, as was individual disability persistency at 91.2%.
Sales in Unum UK continue to rebound, increasing 15.6% in local currency with favorable trends across all segments. The inclusion of sales from last year's dental acquisition contributed 2% to this growth. Persistency was favorable at 86.5%, helping to drive premium income growth of 3.9% this quarter. We expect sales to moderate in the wake of Brexit, and we'll continue to be disciplined in the U.K. market.
Finally, Colonial Life turned in another great quarter for new sales, increasing 9.3% for the third quarter and 12.7% for the first 9 months of the year. Growth remains well balanced between the core commercial market sector and the public sector as well as with sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts.
We've now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales growth, reflecting our continued investment in the business and a favorable environment. Strong leading indicators such as new sales rep recruiting and new sales rep productivity give us confidence that we can maintain this positive sales momentum as we look to invest more in our Colonial Life distribution system to build out territories and expand our presence geographically.
Persistency for Colonial Life was improved in the quarter to 79% from 78.6% last year. As a result, premium growth continues to build momentum, increasing 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.
Overall, we remain pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments. We feel it's important that we remain disciplined in our new business pricing in order to sustain the profit margins we have in our core business lines, particularly in Unum US.  While it can be tempting to push for sales growth, we do not believe that this is appropriate time to do so.
Looking now on investment results. New money yields continue to come under pressure in the third quarter. Fortunately, we were able to meet our new money yield target of 5% for our long-term care portfolio again this quarter, using our typical mix of investment classes and investment strategies, and we have exceeded this target every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review. We will conclude this year's reserve review for long-term care over the next several weeks and currently believe that no special reserving will be necessary for year-end 2016.
If interest rates remain depressed for an extended period of time, we could see pressure on future years, but I'd remind you that we have a substantial cushion between our GAAP and statutory reserves for long-term care, which means that any future reserve increase would most likely be a GAAP event with little or no impact to statutory reserves and therefore little to no impact on our capital deployment plans.
With respect to Unum US' long-term disability business, while we continue to maintain a healthy interest margin in our reserves, all-in yields have fallen significantly from year-end 2015 levels. On the other hand, the underlining profitability of our group disability business has improved significantly as a result of rate increases and disciplined risk management. At the risk of sounding redundant, we are confident that the business can absorb any potential discount rate changes while maintaining an expected loss ratio in the 80% to 82% range. We will provide more clarity on this at our December Outlook Meeting.
The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight the further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to $546 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $433 million at the end of the second quarter and $19 million at the end of the first quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions and credit evaluation process we have followed for many years, not just for our energy holdings, but for our management of the overall investment portfolio.
Moving to capital management. We repurchased $100 million of our shares in the third quarter, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately $600 million as of quarter end, which is at the higher end of our range for holding company cash coverage needs.
During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company and paid off $350 million of maturing debt on September 30. Because of the higher debt level we've been carrying since our debt issuance in May 2016, our interest expense, which we report in the corporate segment, was $7 million higher this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. With the debt maturity, our quarterly debt expense will decline by approximately 5.5% in the fourth quarter relative to this quarter.
The risk-based capital ratio for our traditional life insurance companies improved to approximately 395% toward the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400% for this year.
Statutory after-tax operating earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies were again outstanding at $211.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $187.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. This continues a strong trend in statutory earnings, which on a trailing 4-quarter basis now totals $806 million.
Throughout 2016, our outlook for growth and after-tax operating income per share has been expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. For the first 9 months of the year, we are beating that expectation with growth of 8.9%, driven by good premium growth, solid risk results and a focus on expense management. Therefore, for the full year of 2016, we now expect to be at, if not slightly above the upper end of our outlook range.
We will provide an outlook for 2017 at our December 15 Analyst Meeting, and while we are very encouraged by the operating trends we've seen this year and the momentum it creates for next year, we will face headwinds created by low interest rates on our portfolio yields and discount rates as well as the impact of the decline in the British pound.
So to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the results for the first 3 quarters of 2016. We are executing very well on our strategy, particularly in critical areas such as maintaining pricing discipline despite increased competition in the U.S. market, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewals to help achieve strong profit margins despite interest rate pressure and achieving rate increases and meeting new money yield targets for long-term care. I believe that our success in these areas positions us well to continue to generate value for our shareholders in today's difficult environment.
Now I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments."

Thanks Humphrey. Great question. I'd start by referencing a point that Jack made in his comments, and that's third quarter is our smallest quarter, fluctuates a bit year-to-year, but it's typically about 50% -- 15% of the year so it's subject to a bit more volatility. And I think -- I would sort of take the sales results and put them into 2 buckets, and the first would be around volatility. And when we look at the large case group insurance business, voluntary benefits and IDI, I think we saw a little bit of volatility against some good, large sales in the year-ago quarter. I feel really good about the traction we've got in the market at our value proposition and how we're competing. On the other side though, I would say core group insurance, it's less about volatility and it's more about sustained trend we've seen over the last several quarters. And to your question, while we've been moving rates up on new business slowly over the past I'd say 2.5 years, we have not seen the corresponding increase from the market. And so we've seen close ratios fall off a bit, particularly around new client sales. And while certainly we would expect that given low interest rates the market will eventually move to where we are, we just have not seen that yet. And you know us well enough to know that when the market allows us to write business at sustainable rates in the core, we will be there with all the capacity that's available. You know, just in concluding, what I'd say is persistency remains really high, so not just to focus on new business.  We are doing a good job keeping clients and that's helping to fuel some really nice earned premium growth, almost 6% in the quarter."

So just to sort of give you a little bit of background to what's happening in the U.K., as you know we voted for -- to exit Europe in sort of June and since then there has really been, what I would call an interim period, where people have been -- try to work out what that means. How that's impacting our business, if you look at our results is sales going well, persistency going well, but natural growth, which is really lives and wage inflation has, basic is anemic. It's actually a bit lower than last year, where as -- when we were planning, we thought the economy would be getting to sort of start to motor, and really that's what I see happening in 2017 as well. Is that as people are uncertain about the future, and I think the negotiations will go on in 2017, I think they'll be discerning about bringing new staff on and putting wage inflation into the economy and we'll see that remain low. So we might get 2% to 3% on lives and wage inflation in a good economy, I think it'll be 1% to 1.5%, which is pretty much what we're seeing this year. So I think premiums will be lower than we expected, but we'll still get a bit of growth as we look forward on the scenario that we're planning. Although, I would also say that it is uncertain. And it depends on how the market reacts to those Brexit negotiations. 
So we're monitoring that. We are also taking action around the interest rates because they've dropped off a bit, and again, because the 10-year fell quite significantly. And the most obvious example of where our comparators will be impacted is in the exchange rates. So whilst on a constant currency, I think it will be a bit lower than we expected. On an exchange rate, we're going to see that sort of $1.20 if it sticks there come through each quarter for the next 2 or 3 quarters when we do relative comparisons so you need to factor that into your analyst models."

You know -- we know that several carriers had to go through a process of sort of fixing their books of business, and I guess that's a process that's been ongoing, I thought anyway, for the last couple of years.

And I think your read is largely accurate. I think at any point in time, you've got some carriers that are steady-as-she-goes, some that are moving to fix issues that have worked their way into their books and more aggressively moving up rates, and some that are looking to take share by underwriting more aggressively. And it's really, when you have a condition like I would characterize the current market, it isn't that everyone's out of whack. I think what we have is just enough carriers that are more interested in share than improving margins such that we're not seeing enough opportunity to show sales growth. We're still writing business certainly.

So certainly we had favorable new claim incidents and have had favorable new claim incidents over the last several quarters, but probably a little bit more so here in the recent period. I do think probably proportionately though the bigger driver is just the continued impact of the strong risk management. So when we talked about new price discipline leading to a difficult new sales quarter for us, I would link that directly to being conservative in our pricing. And so as we've worked that through in terms of new business and through our renewal programs, that has had the effect of lowering the benefit ratio in what I think is a sustainable way. And if you put good risk management at the front of the business and we're really strong consistent, high-quality benefits organization at the back end of the process, I think we're really pleased with the outcome. And so sitting where we are at this point is really good.

Just -- we don't like to comment on other people's transactions, obviously.  I would highlight we have a very different business model, but there are some things environmentally, probably worth noting around the long-term care market. We've been discussing for some time that transactions in the space, particular to long-term care will come in due course. We've seen some reinsurance transactions.  Now we see a situation where there's a buyer and a seller in the space and so this doesn't mean anything imminent for us, but I certainly think it does mean progress in terms of the capital markets, long-term care and looking at different solutions. 
The second piece I'd note as well is in this environment, we've been discussing the needs, Jack mentioned that again in terms of what we've been doing around rate actions in the market, the need for those rate increases and our book of business. We've been doing those actions, taking that on. And I think the environment, given some of these things are being highlighted is becoming at least more knowledgeable about the need for rate increases and what's going on, and I think that's the environment that we're looking for. So those are a couple of things going on in that environment. And the last thing I'd highlight is, we also as a company have significant strength across the board that gives us a whole lot of flexibility to do what we wanted to do, any options to pursue, either structurally buying back our shares, as we're doing consistently, and making sure we're taking actions to ultimately benefit our shareholders. I think you had a question specific to some of the things they did, some of the things they're seeing in their long-term care block, and maybe Jack you can make a couple of comments on how it translates or it doesn't translate to our book of business."

And so I don't really want to talk about what Genworth is seeing. I will tell you what we're seeing. And I think probably the most fundamentally important point is we're not scrambling to keep pace with long-term care.  We are working through the long-term care issue, and we're making significant progress as a company towards doing that. We feel like we're in so much better shape today than we were even 3 years ago, and a lot of that is because of that active management of the block. So let me talk to you about what some of those things have been. In 2014, we reset reserve assumptions. We placed those reserve assumptions on a best estimate basis, using our current own experience. And our experience since then has been consistent with those expectations. We also established those -- when we established those reserves, we built in currently filed rate increases using historical approval rates, less than 1/3 of those rate increase assumptions remain outstanding. We're making significant progress against them and feel very good about where the assumptions lie with only a small portion remaining.  That not only helps to support our reserve assumptions, but it also gives us room in the future to react to future adverse claims experience, should it emerge.  The third point I'd make is that our block's unique in the long-term care business, as approximately half of the block is group long-term care with employer funding and extremely conservant plan designs. And mostly -- and because of that group coverage and employer funding, most employees terminate their employer-funded coverage when they leave the employer. As a result, our group long-term care has a lapse rate of closer to 10% versus a less than 1% lapse rate for most individual long-term care policies. And our group long-term care has a substantially lower risk profile. But I think the thing that really sets us apart as a company is the vibrancy of our company and its market-leading positions and strong profitability. We have great free cash flow generation from our core businesses.  We have consistently, over the last 6 years, funded our long-term care capital needs while still allowing us to increase our dividend and maintain consistent level of share repurchases. As a result, our long-term care charges have largely been GAAP events and not cash events, and we would expect that to continue into the future."
